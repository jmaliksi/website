It was currently displaying a map of the world in various colours, indicating the current energy levels in each area through electrical, heat, kinetic, sound and light filters. Each colour represented a different energy use, with white areas being where there was the most output of all types. The Burmecian tapped away at some of the keys and the colours of the tiny flowers that made the screen rippled and faded, zooming in on a specific area.<br><br>"But that's... there's nothing out there," Illiana commented, a hint of confusion in her voice. The point in question was in Canada. Northern side, on one of the islands there. She'd done a bit of research into the areas over there before visiting, which she had yet had a chance to do. Bits of information immediately rose to the surface of her mind.<br><br>"Let me take the filters off," the Burmecian said, tapping away. The flowers shifted colour again, then once more as they zoomed in further. As far as she knew, and based on the map in front of her, there was barely any other life on the island. Illiana had already been given the explanation. The plant-life surrounding Burmecia had expanded outwards as the agricultural, magic and security divisions of the Burmecian government focused on their own protection. Because of that, their technology had given them cameras and other sensory equipment nearly worldwide. Feeble plantlife, it had been explained, was to blame here. The environment apparently wasn't suited for the growth of their security plants, either due to them dying out normally or being destroyed by something. <br><br>"Ah, Illiana, have you discovered anything?" Fratley asked as he entered the room. "I am sorry to have called upon you to assist our security during your visit, but I felt your world knowledge would be beneficial."<br><br>"It's no problem, Fratley," Illiana replied.<br><br>Illiana had arrived in Burmecia a few hours previously, after she had been invited by Fratley to have a look around the city. She had been readily accepted by the majority of the residents, as many recognised her straight away as a South Pole Summoner. One race suffering from prejudice meeting another in the same situation. Fratley himself had given her a tour around the city, and they had discussed what each had been doing since their grand adventure in Yoshimitsu's dimension. Fratley, as he explained, had assumed his duties as Dragon Knight and once again aided the reconstruction effort which was nearly complete. Illiana, on the other hand, had continued her travels across the world to experience more of it for herself. They chatted about what their companions had been doing. Yoshimitsu had opened a small magical artefacts shop that relocated every twelve hours, but was open nearly all the time. Antonio had returned to his life of theft and deception, with one minor hiccup.<br><br>"It's in Canada, Nanisivik I think," Illiana explained, gesturing vaguely at the screen. She pulled her phone from her pocket and opened a map application, zooming in on the location. "The place is currently being renovated into a navy base that's being built over the remains of a town. It used to be a mining spot, but was closed down years ago."<br><br>"That would explain why we have little in the way of cameras there, if they are building over the remains of a town," Fratley commented. "The area must be kept clear to make room for the new base. Troubling. Are we certain they are not responsible for the power surge?"<br><br>"Sorry, sir," the Burmecian at the monitor said. He patted his grey fur down on his arms calmly as he spoke. "The signal seems to be coming from underneath the new construction. Maybe inside the old mines, if Miss Silna's information is correct."<br><br>Illiana connected her phone to the internet and pulled up a few relevant places to the area. Nothing that'd hadn't been said barely five minutes ago. With a sigh, she slipped her phone back into her pocket and looked at the monitor. Getting in would be tricky. Since it was turning into a navy base, that meant heavy guards and probably nearly as much security as Burmecia itself. Or would it? With construction ongoing, would the security be hindered by building progress? She had no idea. If she was going in, she'd have to call in a few friends.<br><br>She blinked. If she was going in? It dawned on her that no one had asked her to do anything. Fratley had only asked her to help monitor the area and pinpoint the location. There hadn't been any order or request to go into Nanisivik. For all she knew, all they would do is monitor the location. Something wasn't settling right with her, though. She asked the Burmecian at the monitor to bring up a few comparison readings to get an accurate measure of how much energy was being used underneath the base, in the mines, compared to other places in the world. Nothing seemed to be an accurate read though.<br><br>"Can you compare it to the entire power outbut of the USA?" Illiana suggested, running out of ideas. According to all the previous results, the power was hundreds, if not thousands, of times greater than even the biggest cities. She watched as the readings came through, then gaped at the screen. It was the first sense of what was going on that they'd seen so far, but all it did was worry her.<br><br>The output was double the entire amount of energy used in the entire United States.<br><br>"That is... troubling," Fratley said quietly, his eyes locked on the screen. "Direct intervention may be required, moreso if the military are not aware of the situation. I would rather avoid a full scale war, but there might not be any choice."<br><br>"There's always a choice," Illiana said, pulling out her phone again and tapping away at the screen. "I'm on it. I've had enough experience with covert operations. I'll go do some recon and report back. Getting past any security they have wont be an issue for me, and I can call in some favours."<br><br>"Are you certain you can do this?" Fratley asked, not because he doubted her, she knew, but because he was concerned for her safety. She waved down any objections she had and did a quick inventory of herself. All of her essentials were stowed away in the various pockets of her cargo pants, her summoning bead on her choker and her spear securely in place on the holder strapped to her back. She had opted for her slightly less practical spear, the one designed to draw out summon monsters, which she was starting to regret but there wasn't much she could do about that now. As she ensured she had all of her belongings, Fratley attached something to her ear. A visor immediately extended to cover her right eye, a small microphone attaching itself to her jaw. Experimentally, she whirled the dial on the side of the headset and watched the different lenses activate. <br><br>"This will automatically synchronise with your phone, as well as our systems here. It has all the usual filters, unfrared, x-ray, heat, motion and so on," Fratley explained briefly. "The microphone works by picking up on vibrations along your jaw but can also detect the sound of your voice. It shouldn't detach from your ear for any reason unless you remove it yourself. I will remain here and observe the situation, and direct you where necessary."<br><br>"Right, I'm good to go then. Wish me luck, Fratley," Illiana said, saluting. She turned on her heel and walked quickly out of the castle. As soon as she cleared the front door, her arms were already moving fluidly as she ran. The dark blue wyvern, Gi, melted into existence and flew alongside her. With a lightfooted jump, she landed on the dragon's back and it took off into the sky.</div></div>

I'll probably edit it a bunch but I'll work on it. Oh gosh what if this leaves a bad impression because it may not be my best work oh dear um well, I guess I'll have to live with it! Maybe it's unclear. I promise I'll work on it if it is in retrospect!</div><br><br>The apartment door was slammed shut with force appropriate to the annoyance Idris was feeling. Which, coincidentally, was incredible as the noise created by the slam reverberated throughout the small space. Not wanting to begin breaking things in the area, Idris took to flopping on the couch and fuming at the ceiling. The ceiling, naturally, did not react to this, and the woman just sighed.<br><br>After a couple minutes, she sat up and plucked off her boots, letting them rest on the floor. Shortly afterwards, she removed an object from her ear, throwing it on the end table. Finally satisfied, she returned to lay down on the couch, not to smoulder, but to sleep. Idris curled up and closed her eyes.<br><br>An incessant noise began to sound in the normally quiet room, forcing Idris to stir. She tried to ignore it at first, but it was akin to an alarm clock, with how it sounded regularly.<br><br>Idris had no alarm clocks.<br><br>She groaned and sat up, rubbing her eyes. Clearly irritated, Idris grabbed the device on the end table and haphazardly shoved it against her ear. "What."<br><br>"Hey hey! I didn't think you were going to pick up!" Silence. Idris tapped her foot irritably as the voice continued. "...You're not still mad at me about that, are you?"<br><br>"There was nothing in that lake."<br><br>"...So you are mad." The voice replied. More silence ensued. "Uhh, Idris? Idris?"<br><br>The woman in question sighed, now fixing the earpiece properly onto herself. She began to put on her boots once more. "What do you want, Evans?"<br><br>"Well, I just received an assignment and-"<br><br>"No." She flat-out refused.<br><br>"No no, I promise it's not like that! It's pretty important and we need someone like you to look into it."<br><br>Idris leaned forward. "I'm listening."<br><br>"Well, there's this lake and-hey hey hey no Id I was kidding!" The voice exclaimed just as Idris was making to sever the connection between them. "No, there's an island out in Canada." He said. Idris waited for Evans to continue, but sighed as she deemed it necessary to prompt him herself.<br><br>"And?"<br><br>"Oh, right!" He exclaimed, causing Idris to flinch at the rise in volume. "There's a massive amount of energy happening there on this one little point. Like, massive. It's really unsettling, to be honest."<br><br>"How big are we talking?"<br><br>"Bigger than the United States combined." Hearing this, Idris' eyes widened subtly.<br><br>"Then what do you want? Canada is far." She stated. Then, as an afterthought. "And not in our jurisdiction."<br><br>"Not entirely, no," Evans conceded on the other end of the line. "But if it poses a massive threat, it may as well. We want you to infiltrate the area and locate the cause. Try not to get too involved, it might be something big."<br><br>"Alright. Let me get my crossbow." Idris said as she fully stood up and walked to the small closet near the bed in the room.<br><br>"I don't understand why you insist on that thing. Guns are better." Evans' voice stopped momentarily, pondering the answer. "Unless it has something to do with your pow-"<br><br>"None of that. It's nothing special." She cut him off as she withdrew a contraption from the storage space, attaching it to the top of her hand. She flexed it experimentally, as if trying on a new glove. "Where's my ride?" She asked.<br><br>"Right outside. I'll keep in touch, okay?"<br><br>"Whatever."<br><br>"Bitch."<br><br>"..." Idris chose to keep her mouth shut and exited the apartment, heading outside where the loud noise of helicopter blades whirred impatiently.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Yoshimitsu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">It was late afternoon when Illiana motioned for Gi to start his descent. That that'd arrived made Illiana grateful. Temperatures at that altitude were nearly like those back home, on the surface, where she'd nearly risked frostbite more than once. As the wyvern descended, she rubbed some feeling back into her limbs and pulled her cloak a little tigher around herself for what felt like the millionth time. She motioned to a lake in the distance and Gi altered his course very slightly, aiming to land next to it. Upon landing, Illiana slid gracefully from the dragon's back and gave him a moment to drink from the clear water before recalling him into his summoning orb.<br><br>"We estimate you are two to three miles out from the base, but we are unsure as to where the mines are," Fratley's voice came through her headset. "Anticipate heavy security around the area."<br><br>"Gotcha," Illiana replied. She pulled out her phone again to verify her location once more. Something caught her eye on the screen. A very small icon in the top bar, a leaf that was contained within a raindrop. Even if she hadn't seen the same emblem more times than she could count today, she could have guessed it was the national symbol of Burmecia. If she was right, that meant her phone had automatically synchronised with the headset, making contacting any allies a piece of cake. With no hesitation, she punched a quick text message into her phone and sent it to everyone she thought could help her out. On a whim, as well, she dialled a number and set it to ring. She could hear the dial tone in her headset, not in her phone. It only took a few seconds for the person on the other line to pick up.<br><br>"Summoner Silna," a synthetic voice greeted. "How can this unit be of assistance?"<br><br>"Hi, Phoenix," Illiana replied, with a guilty grin. "How long did it take you to hack my headset, or did you do it automatically and just let it ring out to keep me guessing?"<br><br>"It took less than a tenth of a second. This unit let the call ring out." There was a pause. "That was a joke," Phoenix responded. "Technology suggests Burmecian origin. This unit concludes that Burmecian authority is also listening to this conversation. This unit has blocked them out temporarily to accomodate. Summoner Silna, how can this unit be of assistance?"<br><br>Illiana could only imagine Fratley and his team's reactions. Knowing her Burmecian friend, he would have stopped any attempts to reclaim the channel, trusting Illiana's judgement. They wouldn't have had a chance anyway. Phoenix was a robot who could simultaneously hold a conversation, hack a number of different devices and prevent anyone from overriding his control. She made a mental note to apologise to Fratley later for not telling him about her friends. First thing, though...<br><br>"I take it you've already tracked my location then, if you've hacked into the headset," Illiana said, a hint of amusement in her voice. "Have you scanned the nearby area."<br><br>"Affirmative, Summoner Silna," Phoenix replied. "Large energy spikes within three miles of your current location. Analysis indicates subterranean source. Unlikely to be due to humans in the area. Stealth would be recommended. Entrance to mining area is heavily guarded to discourage trespassers. Downloading schematics of area to your headset, Summoner Silna. This unit will assist during infiltration. Reopening communications with Burmecians now."<br><br>There was a crackle of static as the channel extended to welcome the Burmecians back. Whether Phoenix would lock them out again when it wanted to speak, she didn't know, but she figured it was better than nothing. She braced herself for Fratley's admonishment, but it never came. There was a small amount of chatter from the Burmecians, but the jist of it was pretty clear to her. It was Illiana's perogative on this mission, so they shouldn't attempt to limit who she could and couldn't contact. She was grateful for that. Fratley still had his level head, even when his impenetrable security had been penetrated. She let out a breath that she hadn't realised she'd been holding, then hunkered down and started formulating her plan of attack. <br><br>With her dark blue cloak still draped over her shoulders, a night time job sounded safer to her. As much as she didn't exactly relish the thought of entering an unfamiliar, underground tunnel system during the night, getting in would probably be a lot easier. With that in mind, she waited. If she had any allies coming, they knew where she was waiting for them.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Beelzebibble</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">The metal tongue of the seatbelt dangled taut at its upper anchorage near the ceiling of the car, and pointed down and inward as though to direct the eye unnecessarily toward the driver, who was conspicuous enough already. Slumped forward in her seat, she lay unconscious of the blood trickling down from her forehead, matting her blond hair and fanning out across the dashboard. When, by and by, her eyelids strained to open and she made the first halting attempt to pull herself back a few inches, it was to see that another figure was looking in through her window. She had only enough time to register the green hair and moving lips before pain forced her eyelids shut again. She felt her muscles go limp once more.<br><br>Next, a thought, with unexpected clarity: <i>Why isn't she yelling?</i><br><br>The green-haired woman outside of the car couldn't have been talking above normal speaking level. Weren't you supposed to shout "Hey! Are you okay in there? Hey"? Unless of course the driver had gone deaf...<br><br>But at this time the smell of burning wafted in and it was awfully hard for the driver to think of anything else just then.<br><br>She wrenched her eyes open, squinting under the pain from her forehead, and peered through the strangely warped glass ahead. The green-haired woman had moved down toward the hood, still mouthing inaudibly. The driver drew a breath, hesitated, drew a sharper breath, and then tried to say "Is there a fire?" as loudly as she could, but all that came out was "'S fire?"<br><br>The green-haired woman said something indistinct in response, but shook her head as well, and the blond driver relaxed slightly. The burning smell lingered, but she found it easier not to think about it. Another drop of blood passed from her temple to her cheek. Her eyes were slipping out of focus. She honed them on the tree at the front of the car, on her side. Actually this wasn't a tree but a telephone pole. <i>Obviously, dumbass</i> made it through, but insulting herself took a lot more energy than she had at the moment. She closed her eyes. If there really wasn't a fire then it was probably safe to catch a few minutes of sleep—<br><br>Then a violent metallic clang at her door brought the driver to her senses. This was followed at once by a high-pitched scraping that shot a sting of protest through her ears. The car was tilting perceptibly toward the other side, and the panicked driver stared through her window at the sight of the green-haired stranger working some kind of instrument against the car. Noticing the driver's distress, she said in a louder and clearer voice: <br><br>"I'll pay for the damages."<br><br>And the driver's door came completely off its hinges and dropped stiffly onto the cement. The burning smell briefly intensified, then dissipated.<br><br>The driver gaped at the green-haired woman, holding what looked like a wooden staff, and started one of probably half a dozen different questions, all of which began with the same slurred word which was the only one she actually managed to speak: "Wha...?"<br><br>The green-haired woman, however, wasted no time in trying to piece together the rest of the driver's question. With nothing more than a reassuring yet brisk smile, she laid her staff against the telephone pole and leaned in through the doorframe. Gently she took hold of the driver's shoulder and forearm and eased her back into an upright position, inspecting the area around the seat as she did so, apparently to make sure there was nothing pinning the driver down. Then she touched three fingers to the blond woman's forehead, so close to prodding the open wound directly that the driver couldn't help but flinch. But the green-haired stranger held her hand steady and spoke in another barely-audible murmur. Through her heavy eyelids the driver looked on in sedated wonder as, a scant couple of inches away from the tip of her nose, the stranger's palm began to glow with a thin white light.<br><br>And a faintly itchy but not unpleasant sensation of pulling-together made itself felt on her forehead, somewhat as if she were crinkling her brow in disbelief, though neither her eyebrows nor the stranger's hand so much as twitched. The driver's face felt dry, her matted hair fell loosely again, and she saw the blood on the windshield and dashboard wipe itself away and vanish. Indeed, her eyesight had restored to normal, and her brain no longer felt sluggish. She hardly needed to glance into the rear-view mirror to know that the gash on her forehead had been completely healed.<br><br>The green-haired woman pulled back her hand and stood up outside the car, and the driver found it hard for a moment to do more than look at her, taking in details that had been little more than blurs beforehand: the jewel on the choker around her neck, the deep blue of her cloak, and the particular shade of green of her hair, which looked strangely muted and organic, unlike the eye-popping, too-vibrant hues that usually resulted from tacky dye jobs. That she was a Power would've been a reasonable guess even before she'd pulled a John Coffey, here.<br><br>Though restored, the driver was still at a loss for words, and at length she had to settle for sinking as little incredulity and as much appreciation as she could into the words: "Jesus <i>Christ</i>, babe..."<br><br>The stranger laughed, then said, "It wasn't a serious injury or anything, a concussion and a bit of a nasty cut on your head. Should be all fixed up now. You might wanna buckle your seatbelt next time before setting off, though. If you don't mind, I could check for any other injuries..?"<br><br>The driver raised an eyebrow with exaggeration. "Oh? I need to strip for that, or—?" But she pulled up out of the driver's seat and took a few perfectly steady steps out of the Chevie. She surveyed the damage. There was a sizable dent at the front left corner, where she'd hit the pole. The headlight was shattered, and the hood slightly crumpled along the side. The windshield bore a substantial crack -- <i>her</i> work, the driver thought with a certain primitive kind of pride, before remembering that the windshield had originally done quite a number on her head in return. And, of course, her door lay detached and still slightly sizzling on the cement. The driver could see where the hinges had been bent askew by the impact, and supposed the green-haired woman must not have been able to pry the door open normally.<br><br>"Damn it," she observed. "God damn it," she added, by way of clarification.<br><br>"What happened?" asked the stranger.<br><br>"God..." The driver leaned an arm on the telephone pole and looked back down the street where she'd come. "It was my fault, I guess," she allowed. "Mind wasn't really on the road, and I <i>know</i> I was cruising north of the speed limit." She pointed up the road perpendicular. "I get here and I'm not paying that much attention at the stop sign, and here's <i>this</i> guy trying to turn the other direction same time that I'm tryin' to turn up that way." She illustrated this helpfully with her hands. "So of course I save the situation by doing a hard ninety right into the pole. Jeez, he didn't even stick around, did he...?"<br><br>Not that she could blame the other driver, honestly. He must not've wanted to deal with her claiming it was his fault, which she would indeed have done. Adamantly. And lying through her teeth.<br><br>She rubbed her brows, then tentatively ran her fingers across her forehead, encountering not the slightest twinge of pain. The gesture put her in mind of something.<br><br>"Hey... I hate to ask, but I'd be an idiot not to. You couldn't just patch up the car, could you?"<br><br>The green-haired girl's face looked torn between amused and apologetic as she said, "I'm sorry, I can only heal living creatures." She paused to check her pockets, then pulled out a notepad and pen. After scribbling something down, she tore a sheet out and handed it to the driver. "Here's my number, I'll need to get to town again but I can get the money to pay for the damages to the car in a couple of hours. My name's Illiana, by the way."<br><br>"Channery," said the driver, accepting the sheet with a frown, "but also, are you kidding? Why would you have to pay anything? Just cause of the door? Hell, I should be paying <i>you</i>, shouldn't I! How much do you want?"<br><br>Illiana laughed, before saying, "No, it's fine. I can cover it. I caused the most damage to the car, after all. Anyway, I think I got the most severe of your injuries but if you notice any dizziness, it should pass. Just a mild concussion." She paused to check her phone briefly, then continued, "I should get going though, I'm meeting a friend soon. Nice to meet you, Channery." <br><br>She smiled and extended her hand. The driver, however, held back.<br><br>"I don't..."<br><br>Channery lowered her head as if to regard the green-haired woman from a new angle.<br><br>"That's -- Look, that was magic, what you did, right? That wasn't just any kind of power, it was magic. Right?"<br><br>Illiana's brow twitched; she was evidently a bit puzzled by the change of topic, but she responded with a clear "Yes."<br><br>"I thought so. Okay. Cool. Now look at this." Channery reached out her hand immediately, then realized that looked a little stupid, as she hadn't thought ahead about what she was going to recall. After a second's pondering, though, she settled her mind on the image of a fat purple candle in a glass jar which proclaimed the unlikely scent of <font size="1">STORM WATCH</font>, sitting on the shelf over the radiator in the upstairs hallway. It happened that the jar was rotated with the label away from passersby and toward the wall. The jar stood fairly, maybe dangerously, close to the edge of the shelf, but the radiator's low height, the glass' thickness and the plush carpeting below made it unlikely that a fall would cause damage. The wax sat high within the jar, testifying to the fact that she'd barely ever lit the candle in the year since buying it. Truth be told, it was one of those restless, distracted, semi-compulsive purchases Channery occasionally made for no other reason than to prove to herself that she didn't need to shoplift every single item she owned.<br><br>Like so: and the candle in its jar suddenly materialized in her hand. <br><br>"That," she said, passing it to Illiana as her handprint faded off the glass, "wasn't magic. I think I was like, maybe eight or nine when I figured out how to do it? 'S far as I can tell, I might've been able to ever since I was born. But you -- I've met a few mages before. I know what it means to become one. People like me, we're just... fuggin'... spoiled brats, kind of, you know? We never had to work for our gifts. <i>You</i> guys have to burn sweat right off your skin just to make it through Rookie's Beginner Guide to Magic for Novices, Chapter One Point Oh Oh One." <br><br>She leaned her weight back against the door behind the driver's, careful to avoid the still-hot frame from which she'd emerged, and crossed her arms. "Seems to me that anyone who starts down that street, does it cause they want <i>something</i> back from the world. And that is why, Illiana, what you're saying is super cute, but you got to forgive me if I'm still trying to figure out what's in it for you, here."<br><br>Illiana rubbed the back of her head, apparently choosing her words carefully: she ran the tip of her tongue over her front teeth before speaking. "I'm guessing by your accent, you're not from the Archipelago originally, are you?"<br><br>Now it was Channery's turn to register confusion at the unexpected subject change, but her response came quickly enough: "Nope, not me. I've lived here 'bout a year now, but I'm from... back that way. A stone's throw north of Eagleland." She pointed behind her in the general direction of the Pacific. "You're a sharp one! Thought I was incognito. I didn't even blurt out a single 'eh'."<br><br>The green-haired woman smiled, but not for long. "If that's so, this might not mean very much to you, but: I'm a South Pole Summoner. We're taught magic from a young age, either healing or combat. We don't really get a choice in that, but it's not such a bad thing. Magic is useful, it's handy. So yeah, I might have exhausted myself just learning how to cure a small cut, that was part of how I grew up. I guess you're right about wanting something back from the world, even if it's probably not what you think. A few -- or -- <i>did</i> you hear about Slateport?"<br><br>Channery shook her head, though she had at least heard mention of the South Pole gang before. Never in much of a favorable tone, but she saw no reason to throw this in.<br><br>Illiana nodded in return, which was a pretty tidy trick considering that she didn't even seem to be looking at Channery, but down at the sizzling door which lay on the street. She scratched her neck again before continuing: "Well, a few years ago, our leader attacked Slateport. He didn't mean to cause destruction, but he was fighting off some of the highest-level Powers that the Archipelago has to offer. They pushed him just that little bit too far, and he brought out his strongest summon monster..." She did not elaborate on this point, leaving the other woman with the comical image of a staticky black-and-white Godzilla flattening a full-color city, but then Channery's better judgment prevailed. She <i>had</i> heard of the Slateport tragedy, though she'd never been clear on the cause or details. Even so, she'd gathered that it remained a serious talking point for anti sentiment across the island chain.<br><br>"Since then," Illiana went on, "South Pole Summoners have been feared or hated. Even up 'til today, anyone suspected of being an ally or sympathizer to us might be arrested, beaten up, anything." Now she met Channery's gaze again with a new firmness to her tone. "But we're not like that. Not even Lord Miko. He only used that summon because he had to. He didn't want to destroy Slateport. On the whole, most of us are content with our lives -- we're not crazy invaders or anything. I left home to travel the world and try to show people what we're really like. That's why I'm happy to put myself out to help people."<br><br>By this time Channery had relaxed her stance, and she rested with both hands by her sides, palms flat against the faintly warm metal. She grinned. "Look at you," she said. "Miss Galahad! <br><br>"Well, I got to say I'm definitely on board with your campaign, so far as it involves doing a bunch of great stuff for me. No -- but seriously. Thank you. I appreciate it. A lot. It's... I'm sorry, is this not sounding all that grateful? I've never had anyone maybe save my life before." She half-forced a chuckle and rubbed her temple. "What I'm trying to say is I owe you pretty big, here. And don't you even give me another word about paying for this shit. My boss's got it covered. I'm runnin' a job for him right now. He'll cut my head off and make me eat it, I'm not saying otherwise, but he isn't gonna leave me out in the cold."<br><br>"I understand," said Illiana, without asking any questions, and this was good since Channery didn't have a quick lie handy. She would not have told the summoner that her boss's name was Massimo Giarrettiera. She certainly would not have added that the job consisted of delivering thirty kilograms of cocaine to the Don's sometime allies, a pair of runners operating out of Brightmeadow under the moniker Salt and Pepper.<br><br>She would hear it from Don Massimo, all right -- the Chevie was a loan from his garages, newer and speedier than her own beat-up Subaru -- but she knew good and sure he wasn't about to fire her over a little hitch like this. It all came back to the wonderful thing about being Channery Keigler, which was that the thirty kilograms were not sitting in her trunk at this very moment. Actually they were under wraps in a stainless-steel case the size of a coffin, fitted with a triple lock and bolted to the floor of the storage room at the far end of the basement. The blocks of powder were overlaid with a felt tray holding two hunter's rifles, and resealed into cardboard ammunition packages. The delivery was still underway. There was no question about this. All that turning in the Chevie meant was that she wouldn't have the convenience of pulling over into the woods on the outskirts of Brightmeadow and loading up the trunk before her arrival. She could just as well call a cab, it was only a problem of keeping up appearances. Come to think of it, she knew a rental service back in Winstone, whose owner the Don had helped out with startup funds. That guy could probably line up three or four fresh cars for her on the double, and she'd have the goods delivered before Don Massimo even needed to know. All she had to do was say the word...<br><br>But Channery was getting ahead of herself, there. Turning her attention back to Illiana, she called to hand a notepad and pen of her own, not unlike those the summoner had on her person. Though Channery meant for this to be a feat as impressive as recalling the <font size="1">STORM WATCH</font> candle, the truth was that the notepad and pen had actually been fetched earlier and then stored in the topmost pocket of her pack, which was in the back seat of the car anyway.<br><br>"Let's just say I owe you a favor, huh?" she said, after writing down her own number and handing it over in turn.<br><br>Illiana hesitated for a moment, but accepted the scrap of paper with a smile. As the Summoner tucked it neatly between the pages of her own notepad, then back into her pocket, Channery saw fit to add: "Owe <i>you</i> a favor, I mean. If you don't mind. Cause, I really hate getting arrested, and there's enough people who want to beat me up as it is..."<br><br>"That's fine," Illiana said, but Channery could only hope the message had sunk in; she looked lost in thought, her gaze unfocused. Channery wondered if she were about to name the favor then and there, but instead, after fidgeting for a second, Illiana slid her phone out of her pocket again and looked at the screen. "I should go, my friend's waiting for me and I'll never hear the end of it if I don't make it on time." She demonstrated the gravity of the situation with a small laugh. "It was nice to meet you, Channery. Try not to crash your car again, okay?"<br><br>Channery shook her head.<br><br>"Or anyone else's," said she.<br><br>They clasped hands in parting.<br><br>* * *<br><br>And that is the story of why Channery Keigler was crouched in an oblong forest-green one-man tent, sipping coffee out of a thermos she had prepared and left on the kitchen counter some eight or nine hours earlier, while outside the harsh Nunavut wind whistled and scraped against the canvas.<br><br>She had to admit that if, in the year since moving back to Canada, she'd ever happened to think about that episode with Illiana Silna, it was only to ponder: <i>Guess I'm off the hook after all.</i> Silna'd had months upon months while Channery was still in the Archipelago, before stealing the Boullogne, but she'd never gotten in touch. Channery had been pretty content to assume that she must have forgotten the debt. What Channery had not expected was to receive a phone call before dawn, stirring her out of her nice Quebecois bed, and to hear that level, concerned voice again, as commonplace as it was instantly recognizable.<br><br>So what could Channery do? She had a favor to return.<br><br>As it turned out, there was an answer to that rhetorical question. What she could do was pack up and haul out north, all the way to the end of Baffin Island that was <i>not</i> conveniently close to Quebec's tip, in order to go have a right merry jaunt around an abandoned mine, apparently because Channery's presence would come in handy if Silna ran out of flashlight batteries or anything. She'd deboarded the puddle-jumper at Pond Inlet Airport, and hiked the rest of the way. Now she was steeling herself for a final ascent up any one of a huddle of stark, frosted hills, from which, according to her map, she'd be able to see the lake where Silna should be waiting.<br><br>If nothing else, this was already the most interesting thing Channery had gotten up to since arriving back in Canada. Well, actually that was a huge lie because pitting all the antique dealers in Quebec against one another in an escalating monetary war over their mysteriously elusive goods was very interesting business. But this was the most physically demanding thing and would probably make the better story to tell her grandkids.<br><br>Channery slid the white woollen toque back down over her scalp, covering her ears with room to spare, and strapped the ski goggles back on, shading a yellow-orange hue over her field of vision. For good measure, since this chink in her armor had bothered her on the hike so far, she recalled a scarf from its place on top of a cardboard box on the shelf in the downstairs hall closet and wrapped it around the lower half of her face, stifling her breath slightly, but this was a fair trade if it would keep her damn nose warm. Finally she zipped up the bulky silver parka all the way, until the rim reached her lips, and put the thick waterproof gloves back on over the thinner but longer-reaching cotton ones. With all of this accomplished, she emerged from the tent, collapsed it, concealed it under some loose dirt and rocks, removed a digital camera from her pocket, and took a picture of the tent's location. <br><br>Forty minutes later she was standing atop a snow-capped headland, overlooking a shockingly bright blue lake which jarred against a monochrome rocky shore on the other side. A heavy mist hung above the still surface of the lake, as if trapped in place by the hills to either side of Channery. The sun had nearly set, and she hastened to find a safe path down the cliff to the water before darkness settled in. Even now she was finding it hard to make out any details around the edge of the lake, any sign that Silna had already arrived. The Summoner had told Channery to expect to find her there already, but how she intended to manage that, Channery had no idea. Using both hands to steady herself against the rock face, she edged her way to a point and jumped down to the next sizeable crag.<br><br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler3975746').toggle();if($('#spoiler3975746').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler3975746"><i>OOC: Hurpy burthdurr urliurtt<br><br>(Btw in case it wasn't obvious, he supplied the Illiana parts.)</i></div><br><br><br></div></div>

I'm still trying to get Illiana's narrative voice down!</div><br><br>Illiana's head shot up, movement catching her attention, and there was someone coming down the hill nearby. Someone was out there, and her hand snapped to her too-glittery, too-bling spear, but she didn't start pursuit yet. Yes, she had expected any allies to teleport in, or make their presence announced, or <i>something</i>, but she couldn't rule it out yet. She unbluckled her cloak and let it fall to the ground, hoping her complexion had paled enough to help her blend in, and moved from her position by the lake.<br><br>Whoever was trying to hike down the mountain wasn't being subtle, she noted, hiding behind a boulder. There was no white, no green, nothing to help camoflague the figure as they made their way down the hill. She leaned out further, just to try to take in more details, and she could see orange and silver and... <br><br>"I don't trust this," she muttered to herself, running to the next rock over.<br><br>It had all the makings of a trap, and she had been around enough supernatural entities to trust things at face value. Slipping behind a rock that would hide her ascent into the mountains, she slipped her spear back into its holder and ran up the hill. Her footsteps were nearly silent and she kept her body low, not moving as fast as some of her friends but with a lot more grace, until she was higher up the path than the stranger. Her vest-top and cargo pants weren't exactly bulletproof, but she decided she could, at least, take this person down without letting them alert anyone else. As long as she surprised him.<br><br>"Stop moving," she said, holding out her palm and summoning up some flames.<br><br>Scared was better than dead.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Channery took a heavy step back, loosening several rocks that tumbled down off the steep incline behind her. She tensed, hearing her breath beat against the folds of the scarf, picturing the Mossberg 930 in the bottom drawer of her work cabinet in the basement, and the Remington 51 on top of the wardrobe in the bedroom. If she'd been wrong about who this figure was -- No, Channery recognized that same voice she'd heard on the phone, more severe now, maybe, but still as composed as ever. The bright golden flare at her hand brought the features obscured by those creeping violet clouds into light.<br><br>Channery pulled the scarf down around her chin and pushed the ski goggles up. "Hey, take it easy!" she exclaimed. "It's <i>me</i>," she added, which was a pretty weak followup but "It's me, Channery Keigler, your pal on this thrilling snowventure" would have taken a while to say and she was running short on air.<br><br>Yes, she was face to face with snowventuring comrade Illiana, but the wary expression on the other woman's face was the only thing Channery didn't recognize. Since when had Illiana gotten so paranoid she was second-guessing a meetup she herself had planned? Here's what Channery had taken Illiana for: smart, yeah, and thoughtful, definitely, but maybe also just a little bit guileless, judging by that big old heap of South Pole Summoner dirty laundry she hadn't been shy about airing out. What would've had to happen in the last eighteen, twenty months to put Illiana on edge like this? Or was their meeting in the Archipelago just a fluke, after all? Sizing up the other woman's defensive posture and the spear at her side, Channery couldn't shake the feeling that this might've been a mistake.<br><br></div></div>

She'd heard it before, just over a year ago, no, just a few hours ago. She dropped her hand and turned her head away, she didn't know if Channery was looking at her but she still tried to hide her embarrassment. It was just like her nowadays, call a meeting point and immediately get paranoid about who might approach. She didn't know whether to blame; herself, her friends, or her situation. Maybe all three.<br><br>"I'm so sorry," she said, because that was the first thought she had. <br><br>She wasn't sure what impression she was making right now, but there was no way it could be a good one. It was that dimension, or maybe just the company she kept, or... hell, there were any number of reasons that she wasn't willing to commit to. She was on edge and she needed to shake herself out of it. A wind played over her shoulders and it wasn't as cold at the Antarctic snow. Of all the things to notice.<br><br>"I mean this in the nicest possible way, but I wasn't expecting you," she said, relaxing her muscles and trying to make her posture as open as possible. "My friends, they..."<br><br>Illiana faltered for a moment, trying to find the right word. Was there a right word? Supernatural? No, not right. Superhuman? More accurate, but so was Channery. The pause had probably gone on for too long now, but Channery hadn't said anything, so Illiana settled for something resembling the truth.<br><br>"They're showy," she said, not entirely sure how the other girl would take that explanation. She continued, "They like to... show off."<br><br>That wasn't helping at all.<br><br>"I've seen my friends teleport and run at super-speed and punch through walls," she explained and, while she could hear her tone even, she was hoping Channery could hear the apology in it. "I rang around earlier thinking someone had some free time or something, that's the way things go with them, I wasn't really expecting someone to..."<br><br>To what? Make the trek from wherever Channery was at the time? Did it matter? She was face to face with someone who had actually responded to her ask for help, and she was feeling embarassed and ungrateful. Hell, she could still feel the pink in her cheeks as she turned her head back to Channery.<br><br>"I'm sorry, I sound like I didn't want you, it's just that I didn't expect you to respond," she settled on, hoping it didn't sound like an insult.</div></div>

Just 'cause I can't teleport or fly around on a dragon?" She heaved a deep breath and straightened up. "Yeah, sorry, babe, I'm kinda boring. Walkin' around all day like a normal person and such. But it looks like I'm all you got so far... Unless one of your COOL FRIENDS is about to come busting through that wall like the Kool-Aid guy." She gestured to a nearby rock face, bristling with icicles that caught the setting sun against the dark sky in a mixture of pink and blue light. <br><br>But the sight of the other woman's anxious face couldn't help but put a smile on Channery's. <i>That</i> was more like the Illiana she remembered. Kind, hesitant, and way too easily flustered. "Hey! I'm messing with you," Channery insisted, spreading her arms in an unwitting counterpoint to the green-haired woman's mildly hunched posture. "Owe you one, don't I? Of course I was going to help you out. It's great to see you again, bee." Closing the distance with the other woman and bracing herself as a wind swept away the embers of Illiana's fire spell, Channery added on further reflection: "Though if one of your friends does come in on a dragon and nobody offered to give me a ride then I <i>am</i> gonna be a little salty about that, okay, just letting you know."</div></div>

The impact nearly threw both of them off their feet, the hollowed space it had emerged from collapsing in a miniature avalanche. With the hiss of pistons, it rose to a quadrupedal stance, revealing itself to be the size of a truck. Unnervingly, the front of its chassis had been painted with what looked like a middle-school art project quality face, stricken eyes and lips standing out against the silver of its titanium frame.<br><br>"CHANNERY!

A fleeting part of her was concerned that something from the explosion would tear Channery's clothes, but the cold hitting her skin was enough to distract those thoughts. It was slush more than ice, a small part of her was relieved that there was nothing that could tear skin. Even so, she pulled herself in and made her frame as small as possible, the ice glancing off her shoulders and shards of gravel barely leaving nicks in her skin.<br><br>When she stood up again, she glanced at Channery.

She could feel the snow and ice and cold and the way it flowed along the ground, how each flake was connected to the next, and the moment her spear pierced the frozen ground, it all surged. Snow built up around the mechanical entity's legs, around the child's body, gathering rapidly and solidifying even faster.

Then she realized it was Illiana who'd somehow drawn up this blanket of snow to trap the mech and its driver. There was, all right, a certain spectacle in watching the ice form itself in a matter of seconds around the lower bodies of both interlopers, but Channery couldn't help keeping her eyes on the other woman, trying to read the hard, flat-browed expression that had crept in on her face. Cold magic, too? Hadn't Illiana been using fire the first time they'd met? Well, Channery guessed, it was <i>magic</i>, you could always crack open another screaming demonic spellbook and learn something new... But there was a way of fitting together just a little too well, to Channery's tastes, between the change in Illiana Silna's demeanor and this newfound specialty.<br><br>Still, it could wait, what with the newcomer putting in such a bald play for everyone's attention.

She moved to the paralyzed mech, and ran her fingers across the chassis just above the crest of ice holding it in place. Too bad – not much exposed machinery that she could have exploited to cripple it – but there was something at the reptillian level that reassured Channery about getting a chance to lay a hand on anything unfamiliar. Best to hedge her bets wherever she could.<br><br>"After a name, do you want to explain why you were looking for us? How you found us? Let's get some cards out on the table.

I pass the consequences along to someone else.</div><br><br>She caught the sound before she saw the arrow.<br><br>It was familiar. It was the sound of air particles shifting, and she hated to call it <i>whooshing</i> but there wasn't really another word to describe it. The sound of an arrow flying past her head, almost close enough to give her a haircut that she didn't want, and she managed to stop herself from jerking away from it. The black arrow planted itself into the base of the ice covering the stranger and her machine, right in the fault line that Illiana thought she had covered. The temporary prison shattered completely and Illiana was turning to find out who had undone her magic.<br><br>Even though she shouldn't have been, she was surprised to see Lex stood there. Lex, holding himself with that same quiet confidence that he always had. His posture relaxed, despite the grip on his bow, his shoulders loose and his stance wide. No, no one else she knew could hit a target that precise, nor know the flaw to look for without knowledge of the magic. He was stood on the nearest hill, bow still raised and an arrow still ready to fly, just in case, Illiana figured. His whole attire was telling her that he was working. Plain white t-shirt, long sleeves, accompanied by tight jeans and a sleeve-less leather jacket. The quiver, he noted, was held to his back by magic and not a strap. He lowered his bow and started his walk down the hill.<br><br>She noticed the way his hair was carelessly styled, away from his face but in waves and curls. The angular features of his cheekbones and his jaw, accentuated by the pale skin he seemed to constantly have. The toned muscles under his clothes, the way his biceps gripped the edge of his sleeves and his calves caused his jeans to strain. No, despite all of that, what she could see the most clearly was the confidence in his walk. Every step landed where he wanted, every quirk of his hands or face was what he was controlling. Nothing was out of place or causing him to stumble. Everything he did, he was certain about it. <br><br>"Hey, Didn't," Lex said, vaguely waving towards the young girl as he hit the flat ground. "What's going on?"<br><br>"Lex?" Illiana, as much as she could take in his appearence, still couldn't quite shake the shock of seeing him. "Phoenix patched in, it didn't say you were coming..?"<br><br>"I finished up my last job," Lex said, giving her a once-over, probably to make sure she was unharmed, then continuing on to help Didn't to her feet and completely ignoring the machine behind them. "Phoenix sent out a general message to everyone, see if anyone was free. It didn't tell you?"<br><br>"And you just happened to be in the area?" Illiana asked, feeling herself relax and purposefully ignoring that Phoenix had signalled he others without telling her. The tension bled from the shoulders and she put her hand on her hip, leaning into the pose as naturally as anything. <br><br>"Pretty much. Dunno why you're putting Didn't on ice, but yeah," Lex replied, turning to face her. </div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">“Apparently, I’m running into all sorts of friends!” Didn’t knelt down and began rubbing at her calves, trying to warm them up, “Not that I’m complaining about a cold reception or anything.”<br><br>”AUTOMATED PUN RESPONSE: GROANING COMMENCING,” Churnsworth responded, followed by a recording of a studio audience grousing.<br><br>”Oh, like you could do any better!” The girl retorted. Didn’t flipped up the fur lined hood of her coat, and brought her sleeves together, shivering slightly.<br><br>“But yes, the mission is really important guys. We really should get going, it sounds like things are really urgent!”<br><br>Mentally, Didn’t put another checkmark under <u>Lies of Omission</u>. She’d never met the guy who’d vouched for her before in her life. However, when some of her closest friends were treating her like a complete stranger, she’d take whatever leverage she could find.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Channery was left scratching her neck, briefly exposing a bit of bare skin to the cold, trying to follow along with the robot girl's amazingly failed attempts to explain herself. Every sentence was like stumbling and falling in an unexpected new direction. There was something in there about winnowing, which Channery was pretty sure no one had done by hand since like Roanoke times, but she had to pretty quickly let that one slide by to keep up with this new nonsense about the president of Benin. Channery frowned. She couldn't begin to guess where Didn't was getting this from. She had never been to Africa and wasn't itching to try it, with the heat; also the thing about Summoners being a force for good made it sound like this fantasy event was widely publicized, and Channery's career plans did not include acts of famous international heroism, or really anything at all that would put her name and power on the front page of CBC. There was something surreal about the whole experience. Was – was this what Carrie Fisher must feel like, faced with some neckbeard blathering at her about his reams of fanfiction? The feeling was honestly skeeving her out a little, that her person had been enlisted as a character in someone else's crappy story that never happened. Maybe a more universal analogy would be someone texting you to say you were in a dream they had, which was one hundred percent of times creepy, even if all you didn't do was hold hands.<br><br>That would make sense, actually, if Didn't just dreamed the whole thing. Oh my god, maybe "Didn't" was a field nickname because she only told stories that DIDN'T HAPPEN, like one of the X-Men. But that still failed to explain how she knew the actually true things she'd said about both of the other women. Channery was ready to press the matter further, but broke off when something struck the ice prison at a high speed, crumbling it into shards and leaving Didn't and her machine drenched but free.<br><br>It was an arrow, shot by someone standing uphill from them. Channery had been too startled by the sudden iceburst to even think about whether she needed to fetch a weapon and return fire. Instead, the first thing she noticed about the figure was that he was dressed ridiculously for the weather. The second thing she noticed about him was that Illiana was busy noticing some seven or eight things about him. As he sauntered downhill toward them, addressing Illiana and being addressed in turn as "Lex", a befuddled Channery watched the Summoner's eyes raptly taking in every detail of the bowman's appearance, her mouth very slightly parted. She even tried to do kind of this casual pose when he drew near.<br><br>Oh, well, then. Huh. All right. Cool.<br><br>But anyway the important thing was that Lex seemed to know Didn't, and Illiana knew him, and Channery knew Illiana, which was enough of a friendship circle to be getting on with. At least that confirmed that Didn't and her machine were not just a collective frostbite vision. When the girl suggested they hurry it along, Channery was happy to pipe up. "Yeah, sure, we should get a move on," she said, tucking one ankle of her snow pants and then the other into her boots; they had ridden up her legs in the commotion when the newcomers had arrived. "Only let's assume that some of us don't, like, <i>know things backwards</i>—" (she pointed a hand at Didn't) "—and that we learn in the usual way, by first hearing a thing, and then having that in our heads. Do you want to run down the specifics of what we're doing?" She shot a weary glance at Illiana. "For those of us woefully behind?"</div></div>
