    <h1>Luxury Train Ride</h1>
    
        <h2 class="poster">ch00beh</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Normally, a trip around the world was nothing too fascinating. Planes did it all the time. Cruises could if they wanted to. The invitation was only intriguing because it promised that a <i>train</i>, the <i>King Thomas</i>, would be the one to carry passengers around the world.<br><br>A woman sat casually on her large leather luggage, waiting on the platform surrounded by the rest of the crowd. She was dressed in a stage costume; a violet corset was laced tightly around her torso, and black leggings ran from the flats on her feet to the tutu around her waist. Her black-gloved hands idly fiddled with a jeweled, golden pendant around her neck. Most striking about her appearance was the ornate masquerade mask covering the upper portion of her face. Three feathers trailed off the right side of the mask, accentuating its asymmetric shape. Beneath the mask, the woman's brown eyes stared off distantly.<br><br>The masked woman seemed to perpetually wear a relaxed smile on her face. If anyone were to have looked for an extended period of time, they would have noticed the smile had not wavered, even when she did tasks that were slightly more involved than sitting down, like when she retied her somewhat long brown hair into a bun.<br><br>The train was due to leave in an hour or so. Maintenance was still getting everything straight and tidy inside, so boarding wouldn't even start soon. Passengers, most dressed well and looking proper, milled about the platform patiently.<br><br>OOC: Ok, I had a lot more exposition planned about the train itself, but I forgot what I wanted to say about it, and it's more fun to let everyone just add train cars and events as needed.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"So, what are you in for?" The line was perfectly recited, as if from a movie. The trademark question of a prison inmate to another.<br><br>A woman clad in similarly bright colors had come up beside her, the movement quiet despite her heavily heeled shoes that were even coloured a loud shade of purple. Her tights were a similarly blazing shade of pink, and she wore a short purple dress with a more demurely colored pink top beneath it. However, the thing that dominated her appearance was a tophat. Not just any tophat, mind you, but one that stood almost two feet tall, and looked as if it were big enough around to swallow the girl's head whole.<br><br>"I'm Helen Mercury. Stage magician, and real magician too. I know that the sleight of hand types hate people like me, but it's not really that bad. They do what they do, with what they have, and I do what I do, with what I have."<br><br>"Didn't keep one from siccing his tiger on me, though. Boy, was that awkward... Got a lot more awkward when news got out about it, and the house was packed the next night."<br><br>Helen adjusted her hat, tweaking its sitting. A gigantic blue ostrich plume fluttered in the breeze.<br><br>"I did my best, but really, there's just no way that you can top 'flaming tiger versus a woman throwing lightning bolts'. It's kinda an impossible act to follow, you know?"<br>--------<br>"Stop fussing with it."<br><br>"I never wear a tie, though."<br><br>"You fuss with it again, and I cut your hand off."<br><br>"Natalie, don't cut anything off of him, please? I don't think Sly has the time or technology to bother growing him a new one."<br><br>"Then he needs to stop messing with that tie. It's making me all nervous, and I don't usually get nervous unless explosions are going off. And they have to be pretty big ones, at that."<br><br>"I shoulda just worn my usual clothes..." The only male in the trio was clad in an immaculate white tuxedo, a precisely knotted tie fluttering in the everpresent autumnal breeze. His braid accompanied it, a long tail running to the middle of his back.<br><br>"There is no way that you'd wear your usual clothes here. Not when Thyra and I had to get all done up." The girl, adressed as Natalie, was wearing a short green dress. It was slitted even further, showing a substantial ammount of thigh. Her shoes were open toed and painfully high heeled, keeping even somebody with balance as practiced as hers constantly struggling to stay on her feet.<br><br>"To be fair, Zebedee does typically dress fairly well. However, for a function like this one, I do believe that more proper attire would be recommended," It seemed Thyra had less reason for complaint than Natalie did, however. She had picked a shoulderless ballgown, mostly in shades of perfect black, but innumerable white dots running in lines from bosom to the very bottom of the dress. Her footwear was not evident, but judging from her stance, was a considerably more comfortable selection.<br><br>"Thyra... Do you really need to keep talking like that?" Zebedee's hand started to move towards his tie, and then stopped suddenly. He pulled away as if burnt, causing Natalie's grimace to loosen even so slightly.<br><br>"I'm sorry Zebedee. It's just... This is what my parent raised me to be around, as I'm sure you know. With their jobs, they had a lot of important people over as visitors. So they wanted to ensure that my behavior wouldn't leave a bad taste in the mouths of any potential donors or patrons..." Thya's expression fell ever so slighlty, her warm brown eyes growing colder at the hand of the past.<br><br>"Hey, I know." Zebedee put a hand on her shoulder. Thyra jolted slightly with the touch, and looked over to him with a nervous smile. He drew away, but there was a grin on his lips.<br><br>"Honestly... You two-" Natalie was interupted by one of her shoes deciding to take a detour to the side, leaving her spinning her arms wildly for balance.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">hermes</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Really, I would've thought you'd be more forward..." Prime said, clapping a hand on Zebedee's shoulder.<br><br>"But still, we should keep our comments to ourselves." Eragon said, grinning brazenly from behind Prime.<br><br>The two of them were a stunning contrast. Eragon was wearing a white silk suit, with a deep purple undershirt to set off his azure hair, and a long white tie, tucked neatly under his coat. He smiled, revealing stunning pearly white teeth.<br><br>Prime on the other hand was wearing a black suit, with a pinstripe red silk undershirt, and a black silk tie with a gray and black crosshatching pattern. It gave him a smokey look, accentuated by his red hair, and brightened his eye's to such a degree, that they could almost be mistaken for the moon.<br><br>The two of them looked like old friends reunited, and more than a little glad to see each other again, and quite willing to tease and jest with those around them.<br><br>Eragon smirked a little, and bowed to Natalie. "Why Natalie, you look absolutely lovely. You <i>must</i> dance with me later, I'd be remiss if I were to lose the chance."</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">ch00beh</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"I am here on vacation," the woman said while looking up at Helen. Her voice was distant, as if she weren't completely there, but there was a strong air of confidence in every word. "Call me Masquerade. I perform on stage occasionally, but mostly I just do things for the fun of it."<br><br>----<br><br>Rie walked through Zebedee's closed door to find everyone playing dress up. She looked like she had just woken up due to her gym shorts and hoodie.<br><br>"What's going on in here?"</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Beelzebibble</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">The three gentlemen were dressed in relatively modest tuxedos, between which the only substantial difference -- apart from the obvious variations in cut -- was the color of their ties. The gentleman wearing the golden tie was the shortest of the three by at least a head, and sported a receding hairline and some premature creases about his face, yet was also the only one among them who was smiling. He lit a cigarette and sighed, taking the crowd around them in with contentment. The gentleman wearing the scarlet tie was the stoutest, with a muscular frame and heavy eyebrows. His arms were folded over his broad chest, and he seemed more interested in intimidating those who passed by than welcoming them. The gentleman wearing the turquoise tie was the leanest. He possessed curly hair, glasses, narrow cheeks and no evident interest other than examining the shiny chassis of the <i>King Thomas</i>.<br><br>The gentlemen in the golden and scarlet ties had identical Aquiline noses. The gentlemen in the scarlet and turquoise ties had the same very dark eyes. The gentlemen in the turquoise and golden ties had similarly slender hands.<br><br><div align="center"><img style="max-width: 100%;" src="http://i322.photobucket.com/albums/nn433/asgardreid/gbros.png"></div><br><br>"The hell are these people thinkin'?" Cesare muttered, pointing at a pair of women. "Look at those two. What are they, a peacock and a flamingo? I mean there's dolled-up and then there's just <i>tacky</i>. And check out the guy with the blue hair. That's got to be some kind of--"<br><br>"Says Cesare, resident fashion virtuoso. Soon to debut on National Geographic as <i>The Clothes Whisperer</i>." Massimo puffed on the cigarette while batting away the middle brother's punch. "All right now, come on, let's see some professionality."<br><br>"The hell's their problem, though?"<br><br>Massimo craned his neck to catch a glimpse of the ladies Cesare had pointed out. "I'd say they're probably actresses. Part of the trip's entertainment... If we're lucky."<br><br>"Peacocks can't be female."<br><br>Both of the older brothers looked at Nico, who hadn't spoken for perhaps ten minutes. "What's that?" Cesare asked.<br><br>"Peacocks can't be female."<br><br>"What are you talkin' about? Of course they can."<br><br>"Female peafowl are called peahens. They don't have the plumage."<br><br>Cesare shrugged his shoulders. "Whatever."<br><br>Massimo wasn't prepared to open up an argument about the necessity or otherwise of gender agreement in metaphor, especially because he doubted his youngest brother had something more to say on the matter in any event. Instead he simply tapped his foot lightly on the platform.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Yoshimitsu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">OOC- I'm not sure on this, since Lee's and ch00bs' posts are telling me two seperate things. From what I can gather from Lee's post, they're waiting for the train? (The bit about the autumn breeze)<br><br>"Man, don't I feel like a fish out of water," Yoshimitsu commented, catching one of Natalie's flailing arms and helping her right herself. "Shirt and tie deals... so not me."<br><br>The boy looked, for once in his life, presentable. Despite his ever-vibrant blue hair, spiked perfectly with the sweeping side fringe, the rest of him looked almost formal. A pure white, brand new and completely unblemished shirt covered his torso, the long sleeves joined by silver cufflinks around his wrists. A deep blue tie ran down the middle of the shirt, swaying slightly in the breeze. Hooked around his finger and thrown casually over his shoulder was a black suit jacket with deep blue lining, the same colour as his tie. It was blatantly expensive, and quite possibly cut specifically for him. Suit pants to match his jacket clung to his hips loosely, held up by a leather belt. His shoes, black and shiny, were a drastic change from his usual ratty old trainers.<br><br>"Yeah... uh, hi guys," he said sheepishly to the small gathering. "The train part had me interested. Thought I'd check it out. How ya been?"</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"If I can actually walk later, you might get a chance." Natalie growled. She stomped her heel, throwing herself off balance once more. Yoshimitsu caught her this time, and the warrior quickly shifted her balance back into a more steady position.<br><br>"I'm this close to just going barefoot, I swear-" She turned, slightly, and as an afterthought, "Thanks, Yoshimitsu."<br><br>"It's not exactly my deal either, but the food is good, and Sly had a few spare tickets to pass along. Something about helping iron out a few tech issues or whatever. I dunno. But here we are."<br><br>"We've been doing well, Yoshimitsu." Thyra nodded to him, and stepped closer, her gown rustling as she moved.<br><br>"Not much action around Whelkshore since... You know." Zebedee offered without facing the new arrival. Ender's passing was still fresh in a lot of minds, and bringing it up around Natalie was a surefire way to provoke her.<br><br>"Though we're managing to keep busy, elsewhere. Slateport's repairs are going nicely, and we're starting to actually get quite the influx of people. I actually have neighbors for once that aren't fellow workers in the reconstruction." Thyra's voice trembled ever so slightly.<br><br>"That's the first time in almost six years."</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">hermes</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Prime put a consoling hand on Thyra's shoulder, "If it makes you feel any better, I was thinking about setting up a place in Slateport. Whelkshore is a little... High profile, when you possess a supernatural ability." He said, taking his hand from her shoulder and turning to Zebedee.<br><br>"Speaking of which," He said to Zebedee, "Look at these." He said, holding his hands out palm up. On each one, was a tattoo of an azure star. Each one was inscribed with an effect that caused the surfaces of the stars to roil as though burning as the eye shifted across them. The one on his left hand seemed to be surrounded in a fine mist, the one on his right had flowing rings of plasma fire.<br><br>"I'm not entirely sure how these happened, but I wouldn't say I'm an ordinary human anymore." Prime said thoughtfully, "Speaking of which, I seem to be having flashbacks of a life before this one. I knew you then to, apparently. Do you remember anything about that? Eragon there says his memories of that time are there, but hazy."<br><br>"Gladly take you up on that," Eragon was saying to Natalie, "As for the shoes, well." He pulled a face, they looked painful, "You know there's a woman's shoe store just outside the station. Along with purses, assuming you want one to go with that outfit." He said, sidling up to Nat, "So, where in gods name do you hide your weapons in that thing?" Eragon asked curiously.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">ch00beh</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">The corners of Masquerades lips curled up slightly higher. "It really shouldn't surprise me that I get so many looks when I'm dressed like this. And with you standing beside me, Helen, it shouldn't surprise me even more. But even still," she was looking directly at a trio of distinctive men gawking judgmentally at the pair, "I can't help but notice when it happens."<br><br>The look she gave the men was friendly. It could have been an invitational expression, if less of her face was obscured. "I suppose the intriguing thing is that these three were the only ones in the crowd to stop and stare instead of glancing, doing a double take, and looking away as if nothing were there."<br><br>----<br><br>Rie walked up the steps to the platform with practiced ease despite her high heel stilettos. She actually liked these shoes. In times of emergency, she could take them off and stab things with them. She made her way to the group.<br><br> "You should all stop fidgeting. Clothes are just pieces of fabric that cover your skin," she said idly. She herself was wearing a simple black gown, and if her expressionless face was any indication, she was completely indifferent towards it. Over her gown, however, was a brown hoodie that looked slightly too big for her frame.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">SV</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Mahlon Moore waited on the platform in the midst of a growing crowd of well-dressed individuals. She herself wore an understated gown cut like a sundress, its silken fabric dyed the teal color of a tropical lagoon; visually, she blended in with the mass. However, she knew no one. Her long coppery hair blew in sleek strands in the breeze, fluttering about her face as she studied her ticket for what must have been the hundredth time. <br><br>Three weeks ago she had received it in the mail and thought it had been misaddressed. A quick call to the number supplied on the congratulatory letter confirmed that it was indeed hers, but she still could not figure out <i>why</i> it was hers. <br><br>Or, for that matter, why she was here. <i>All expenses paid trip on the premiere voyage of the </i>King Thomas<i> luxury train,</i> was all the brochure had to say. The destination was vague and the guest list even moreso. Once again, Mahlon found herself considering turning around and grabbing a taxi home.<br><br>It was then that someone collided with her luggage cart.<br><br>Several small parcels, both hers and those belonging to the dapper businessman who'd run into her, scattered themselves all around. She gasped, startled, but before she could move the man began to collect them all, spouting apologies all the while.<br><br>"Ah, sh-- I'm sorry, miss." <br><br>"No, no, it's alright --"<br><br>"--Really, I apologize --"<br><br>"It's nothing, don't worry --"<br><br>"--Should've been watching where I was going --"<br><br>"It's fine, really -- um -- that's mine…Oh…" Her brow furrowed in confusion as the stranger began loading her own suitcases onto his cart.<br><br>"Hand me that there, would you, miss?"  The man gestured at a hatbox that had rolled a small distance away from her.<br><br>She stooped to pick it up and turned back to him, holding it out uncertainly. "I'm sorry, but…do I know you?"<br><br>The man raised an eyebrow at her and extended a hand. "Sarosin Narita," he said pleasantly before turning back to their luggage. "You do now."<br><br>She shook his hand and continued to watch, perplexed. "But...those are my things."<br><br>Sarosin leaned one hand on the handle of the cart, eying her. "I don't believe I caught your name."<br><br>"...It's Mahlon. Mahlon Moore."<br><br>Sarosin inclined his head toward her courteously. "So it is. Well, Miss Moore, it is hardly befitting a lady such as yourself to struggle with such cumbersome burdens as these." At this, he plucked the hatbox from her hands and nestled it on top of the precarious stack of suitcases. "Now, if I'm not mistaken, you and I have a train to catch."<br><br>Smiling genially at her once more, he turned and heaved the luggage cart into motion, maneuvering it deftly into the thick of the crowd toward the front of the platform. His broad muscled shoulders barely seemed to strain under an expensive khaki trench coat.<br><br>Mahlon stood for a moment, befuddled, before rushing to catch up with him on satin-slippered feet.<br><br><br>OOC: Rhys may come in later.<br></div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Beelzebibble</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">After catching the eye of one of the flamboyantly dressed ladies, Massimo lightly nudged Nico's arm. "They've noticed us. Whyn't you go say hello." Nico gave no indication of hearing this. "Hey, come on, you're the ladykiller here," Massimo smiled.<br><br>"<i>Nico?</i>" Cesare let out a snort. "Please. Little bro's got nothin'. Tell you what, I'll go." He slid the strap of his duffel bag off his shoulder and laid it on the platform. Then he started toward the ladies.<br><br>"I don't think I asked you to," said Massimo.<br><br>Cesare stopped short.<br><br>"I'm fairly sure I decided to field Nico for this one." Massimo nodded to his youngest brother. "Go on, work your magic. Make sure to ask if they've got a friend..."<br><br>But this remark fell short of reaching Nico, who had already moved past Cesare and into the crowd. After narrowly sidestepping a station worker pushing a mountainous luggage cart, he approached the women.<br><br>"Excuse me," he said to the one wearing the top hat, on the grounds that the other one's face wasn't fully revealed, which would make his next lie less plausible. "Haven't I seen you before?"</div></div>

She briefly glanced at the two other similarly men, then turned back to Turquoise. Her smile was slightly wider than before, revealing perfectly whitened teeth. From afar, it would seem like she was absolutely enthralled by the young man in front of her.<br><br>Masquerade stood up and took the young man's arm. She leaned in close to his ear. "Tell me, how long do you think we can keep this charade before your associates come to investigate?" She giggled.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">OOC: I don't know where the hell people keep getting Cherrygrove from for Helen. She associated with Rie before Rie was Cherrygrove, and Terrian before he was Cherrygrove. She's not hostile towards them, but she's Summoner first, Brogues'n'Rogues second, and about as much Cherrygrove as, say, Tanner. She's cooperated with people in that alliance twice, now, in her whole career.<br><br>Granted, Terrian assumed she was Cherrygrove, but that's only because at the time, he met her as a friendly power, and the popular opinion on "Summoners" is something akin to WWII anti-Nazi propaganda.<br><br>BIC: "You may have, may not have," Helen shrugged noncommittally, her tophat bobbing. It was slightly evident how it was held in place, coils of tightly styled purple hair sweeping up from her head and into the hat. Evidently, she had it in a bun, or something similar, for it to catch on.<br><br>"And don't go thinking that we're all that memorable. Sure, I'm brightly dressed and a bit of a looker, admittedly, but on the other hand, so is almost any showgirl. If this fellow happens to make regular trips to Vegas, I'm merely one gaudy, shapely face in the crowd."<br><br>"I don't know if you heard my name before, but maybe it'd ring a bell. Helen Mercury, hm?" Helen extended a hand in greeting, ignoring Masquerade's comments with a slight air of impatience. A lot of people in show business were eccentric, but... Some people could be frustrating, in ways.<br><br>Hopefully, Masquerade would get tired of this little game before it got too exasperating for Helen.<br>-------<br>"We'd welcome you in Slateport..." Thyra drew away from the touch, gingerly.<br><br>"Considering how we're still establishing the vital functions of society, people who can help keep order and fend off those that would try to exploit our situation are always in demand. Sly and I are almost constantly busy, and the other people in our group aren't much better off."<br><br>"That's for sure. I put in two days a week on the reconstruction effort, and those don't really... Well, I don't get to rest very much during them," Zebedee sighed.<br><br>"I did associate with another man named Prime... Though he was different. I don't really know how to say it, but he was something else. Like he was on another level or something." Zebedee took a hold of Prime's hand, scrutinizing at the design.<br><br>"In fact, he gave me something that looked very similar to those." The young man released his grip and turned away. "Not that I still happen to have it. Got misplaced or somesuch."<br><br>"I don't need a purse. Really, if it wasn't for trying to keep my appearance good enough for this crowd-" Natalie flickered, the shoes disappearing, and her coiled blade appearing in her hand, "I wouldn't even be wearing those blasted things...

He frowned thoughtfully, she'd probably look great if not for the hoodie.<br><br>Prime smiled understandingly as Thyra pulled away, he wasn't hurt, the touch had merely been friendly, and he was a bit of a touchy person by nature. He liked to try to inspire strong bonds in his friends, and few would go so far as to express themselves in a consoling touch.<br><br>Prime nodded to Zebedee's comment about the stars on his hands, and pressured the tattoo's with his will.<br><br>"Yeah I know, only now there seem to be two of them." Prime said, each of the differently styled stars hovering, in miniature, above his hands.<br><br>"I don't really know what to make of them, but they do become a sword and armor when I sort of, release them? I think release is the right word. Release them from my hands." Prime said, his brow furrowing thoughtfully.<br><br>"Aaaah," He sighed, "Shame we don't have the time or space for a spar, I'd really like to explore this, but I haven't had time. When I came back from out last adventure, I found that my assets had been seized by, uh," And he lowered his voice here, "Nopcsa and his cohorts. My possessions and pending return to my pocket, but apparently they anticipated that I'd be more against than with, and locked up my house in a pocket dimension." Prime sighed,<br><br>"Thats why I was asking Thyra about Slateport," He said, "It seems to be close enough for me to get here quickly, if I need to, and there's lots of room for realestate expansion right now. Even if sad circumstances are the cause, we all need somewhere to live, and I've never been fond of renting."<br><br>Just then, the young player caught his ear, and he noticed another familiar face. "Helen! Now there's someone I haven't seen for a lifetime!" Prime said, chuckling. He looked over the young player, and shook his head.<br><br>"Tisk tisk tisk," He said, "Never say what any other man would say. That's a terrible opener, get in with the group, then isolate her. Gotta make sure the friends don't cut you off." Prime said, then started laughing again.<br><br>"Sorry for going off on a tangent on you Zebedee," He said, cooling down, "But it seems my luckless search from romance is futile." He shivered, "I'm still a bit afraid that demon princess might take a side trip to our plane to visit." He started muttering, then dismissed the idea. The laws of their world should, theoretically, prevent it..<br></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message"><i>The train is going to be leaving soon</i> Aquara thought to herself, desperately trying to hurry to the boarding platform. "Can't you go any faster!" she stated demandingly to the taxi driver. <br><br>"I'm sorry Ma'am the speed limit is--" <br><br>"I don't care what the speed limit is, just get me to that boarding platform!" Aquara shouted angrily.  <br><br>The engine of the vehicle roared as it weaved through traffic making its way to the destination.  Quickly, but certainly not legally, Aquara had arrived at the building sporting the boarding for the new train, which was curiously named "Luxury Train". <br><br><i>High heels are so troublesome for a girl like me</i> Stepping out of the vehicle, her attire was exposed, showing what she had decided to wear to this gathering of individuals.  She was showing a beautiful ball gown, that mixed in a mask party style as well.  The dress was strapless allowing her nape and neck to be exposed, showing her natural, and slightly tanned, skin.  Following down, her bosoms were covered by a black corsette, with white ribbons tieing down her exposed back. The corsette was outlined with what appeared to be white feathers.  The gown itself had sections of white, and black striped going in a verticle direction, when counting there were two black, and two white stripes, one following another.  Aquara's heels were black as well, with white feathers at the heels facing pointing upwards.  <br><br><i>Oh, good, they are all still here.  Thank goodness</i> Aquara casually walked to the boarding station.  As she made her appearence, she didn't really see anyone that was immediately familiar to her.  "Ah..." She said sighing, "Maybe I should have brought a friend to keep me company."  She adjusted her glasses, and checked her hair, to make sure that her 'Up-do' was still in tact.  Whipping out a black and white feathered fan, she covered half her face, and made her way in to mingle with the attendee's. </div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Charmed, gentlemen," Masquerade said to the brothers. She opened her mouth to say more, but before a sound could escape her glossy lips, a shrill cry whistled across the platform. After the sound slowly subsided and faded away, a man dressed in a black uniform stepped out of the train to address everyone.<br><br>"The <i>King Thomas</i> will be departing in fifteen minutes! Please present your invitation to a conductor before boarding the train."<br><br>"Well, gentlemen, it was a pleasure meeting all of you," Masquerade turned to Helen, "and you as well, Magician. I trust we'll all see each other inside?"<br><br>With that, she spryly hopped to her feet and picked up one end of her luggage. The other end had wheels, so dragging it across the platform to the train was a trivial manner. However, it seemed that bringing the large case up the stairs into the train would be a challenge. After presenting her invitation to the conductor, Masquerade stood in quiet contemplation for a moment.<br><br>"Ma'am, do you need any help wi-" the conductor began. Before he could finish, Masquerade had firmly gripped the handle on her luggage and with surprising ease, threw it inside.<br><br>"No, but thank you for your offer." She winked as she stepped into the train. She shook her arms; just because she could throw her case without breaking anything didn't mean she didn't strain herself.<br><br>-----<br><br>Rie slowly made her way through the crowd. Literally. She was walking at a steady pace, phasing through whoever happened to get in her way. In this fashion, she got to the front of the line in about a minute.<br><br>"Uh," the conductor said, stricken with a mixture of fear and confusion. He rubbed his eyes, and when he reopened them with Rie still standing there, the look on his face showed that he wasn't the most happy person around. "Y-your invitation, miss?"<br><br>"Invitation?" Rie said.<br><br>"Yes. This was an i-invitation only ride."<br><br>"Oh."<br><br>Rie retreated back through the crowd to Zebedee and company. "Do any of you have an invitation that I can use?"<br><br>Everyone shook their head.<br><br>"Oh. I'll meet you guys inside, then."<br><br>With that, Rie dropped through the ground. Moment's later, the discerning eye would have caught movement under one of the train cars.</div></div>

"Nice piece of work," he smiled, gesturing down the length of the train. "Giarrettiera. G-I-A. Three for first class. Quite the honor for everyone, isn't it."<br><br>The conductor nodded. "One to tell the grandkids about." He crossed off a few lines on a list, then looked back down at Massimo, and then at the other two who were still standing some distance beyond. "Those'll be...?"<br><br>"Misters Giarrettiera and Giarrettiera, yes. The full set for this one. All right, in they go -- no need to show off, there -- all right, <i>easy</i>..." For Cesare, who had obviously seen the masked woman toss her case into the train car unaided, seemed determined to prove his own capability by throwing in his, Massimo's and Nico's baggage with only one sizeable hand. <br><br>Massimo said in a low voice, "Cesare, you're my brother and I love you, but so help me if you just broke any of my things you are going to be deboarding the train somewhere on the Pacific."<br><br>Cesare snorted. "Carry your own shit, then."<br><br>"Take not my words lightly," Massimo warned. Raising a hand to the conductor, he moved up the steps and into the car. A stewardess directed them to the first class car, an impressive piece set about with high-backed plush chairs that formed open rings. Massimo settled into one of the rings, slid his duffel bag under the seat, and settled back. Cesare and Nico followed; the former sat near the edge of the ring and kept a cagey eye on the rest of the car, while the latter simply perched his elbow on the windowpane and stared back out at the train station.<br><br>"Comfy," Massimo said.<br><br>"Could be worse," Cesare said.<br><br>Nico had no comment.</div></div>

The supports were cantilevered out of the two walls not being occupied by the door or window. <br><br>Rie sat down on one of the beds, noting the head rests built into the wall. She considered saving the room for the rest of her company, but decided that physically stopping the rightful tenants to this room would be too annoying to clean up after. After thinking of all the ways to dispose of a body on a train and giving up, the girl stood up and opened the compartment door, stepping into the relatively tight hallway.<br><br>Other passengers were busily pulling luggage through the corridor and into their respective rooms. Rie pulled back into her room twice before deciding that moving to a different room was more trouble than getting rid of a body.<br><br>Ten minutes went by, and many more snazzily dressed folks meandered by Rie's door. The number of passing persons (passingers) slowly dwindled as time went on, and when the hallway had almost completely quieted down, the train's whistle blew again, indicating that it would leave soon.

Her heart was pounding fiercely inside of her chest from how fast she'd been running, and she felt dizzy as she stood there hoping for it to calm down soon. As she gently rested a hand on her bosom, feeling every strong pulse of her heart beneath her fingertips, she looked down at the ornate lime green and gold gown that she was wearing and sighed. She wasn't used to wearing such fancy clothes, though it was pleasing to be adorned in garb decorated in the same mystical emblems that she bore in the tattoo on her back - the mark of being the oracle of Raijuu, Divine Dragon of Light. Nagisa took deep breaths and cursed her being so late to have had to run and jump onto the train, but after all, she had no idea that she'd be so late in reaching the station, having the misfortune of being given very sloppy directions in how to reach it. Minutes ticked by, and finally she felt as though her heart was beating normal enough again for her to move about the train. The magenta-haired elf girl wondered as to where her compartment might be located, and it looked as though she was the only one who hadn't found their room yet, the hall being empty. Also bothersome was the fact that there were no attendants in sight for her to question about finding her room. Distressed and a little worried, she gazed up and down the corridor while nervously stroking the back of one of her long pointed ears - eagerly hoping that an attendant would appear soon...</i></div></div>

The train lurched forwards ever so slightly, and the warrior raised an arm, bracing against the movement.<br><br>“Not that the help wasn’t appreciated…” Nat glanced at the young man for a moment, and then turned away, “But I really have to be on my way. We’re gonna be on here for a week or so, and I’ll be damned before I’d be caught not knowing where all the different dining cars are located.”<br><br>Her cheek twitched slightly. Almost a smile, or at least, a small, halfway aborted grin. She pushed past a young couple admiring the scenery, and continued working her way towards the front of the train.<br>-------<br>“Eh, either or… Not my favorite choices, either way,” Zebedee muttered with a smirk. He extended a hand to Thyra, who held up her palm.<br><br>“Either way, I think you’ve gotta go about this the same way,” Zebedee shrugged, a few traces of sunlight dancing through his aura.<br><br>“Yes, I’m aware. It’s just… Well, you know…” Thyra looked downwards for a moment.<br><br>“Mmhm. Gotcha.” Zebedee rose up from the train platform, the winds around him intensifying. A cloud of dust and leaves flew out to all sides from him.<br><br>“Of course, I am in a dress-“<br><br>“Fly low, right?”<br><br>“I suppose.” Thyra put her arms out before her, the air beneath her forearms rippling under some otherwise invisible force.

A fellow, tall and clad entirely in shades of red, gold, and white, had stepped up behind them. His distinctive blonde mustache twitched with a slight smile.<br><br>“You, of all people, should know that the <i>experience</i> of <i>luxury</i>, is of all things, the greatest treasure. The people are an important portion, but it is the experience in its entirety that is the thing one should seek.” The man nodded to Aquara.<br><br>“For example, you two beautiful young ladies… Put you in these fine dresses, at the site of one of the most important events in the history of travel, and you’ve got an occasion, and company, that a man such as myself would be remorseful to miss.”<br><br>“But, say that we all were in sweatclothes, lounging about? Well, I find it doubtful that many people would be willing to pay for tickets to such an event, even in spite of your formidable charms.”<br><br>“Ms. Wallen is already an acquaintance of mine, I’m happy to say. But I do not believe we have ever met before, Ms. Oceanara?” The man offered his ticket to the man at the boarding platform, and stepped into the train after his companions.<br><br>He offered his hand to her for a greeting handshake. Sinuous golden patterns, reminiscent of dragons, wound down the sleeves of his shirt. A large ruby on each cuff completed the image, alluding to a dragon’s eyes without becoming an outright depiction.<br><br>“They call me Orville Giguere. Collector of rarities, and on this occasion, fellow traveler. I am quite pleased to have met you.”<br>-------<br>The door into the car slid open with a gentle click.<br><br>"Hey, there," A friendly voice called out from behind Nagisa, one of rather mundane pitch but with a strong note of confidence to it. The speaker entered, a young woman. She was a bit shorter than the oracle, but still had to duck as she came through the doorway. A large pink tophat made the maneuver neccessary, towering over her head like a wastebasket turned on end.<br><br>"You doing okay?"

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Nico, who was still gazing through the glass at the buildings that passed by as they left the city, noticed something out of the corner of his eye. He looked as far as he could off toward the back of the train, but didn't see anything unusual. He was about to put the matter out of his mind when whatever it was flickered again into his peripheral vision. He unlatched the window and pulled it open.<br><br>"Good thinking," Massimo commented. "Little breeze in here would be nice."<br><br>Nico bent forward to poke his head out the window, and the wind promptly threw his curly hair back. Now he had a much better view of the full length of the train. He held his gaze patiently. After another moment, the thing veered back into sight. It was, in fact, a long-haired man flying at a low altitude above the railroad tracks after the train, followed by a black woman in a dress.<br><br>"Look," he said, and withdrew so Massimo and Cesare could peer out.<br><br>"Jesus!" Cesare grabbed the windowpane with one hand as if he were afraid of falling out. "Shit! Are you <i>kiddin'</i> me? What the hell <i>are</i> they?"<br><br>"Think they're called 'Powers', Cesare," said Massimo, settling back into his seat, "and I'm pretty sure there's a handful of them around these parts. Of course, you can't be implying that you don't remember when--?"<br><br>"Fuck, I didn't know they could <i>fly</i> though!" Cesare pulled the window shut tightly. Now it was as if he were afraid the two Powers were about to swoop in. His large fingers fumbled with the latch.<br><br>"Calm <i>down</i> for God's sake," Massimo said idly.<br><br>"Are you serious? You know the kind of shit these people are always stirring up. You tellin' me you're gonna be surprised when those two try to blow up the train?"<br><br>"Cesare. Did you catch something? They were both wearing glasses." Massimo pulled a book out of his bag and flipped it open as he went on. "Now, do people with glasses blow up trains? Cesare, I submit to you that they do not. I submit that people with glasses take their dates home, chop them up and stuff them in the freezer, but they do not blow up trains. Exhibit A," he finished, gesturing to Nico with his bookmark.<br><br>"Open that window back up for me, will you," he added. "I liked the breeze."<br><br>Cesare slid back from the window and out of Nico's way as the youngest brother unfastened the latch again and pushed the window back open. For good measure, he took another glance out toward the caboose, but he couldn't see the two flying figures any more.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Telrien boarded the train while Orville Giguere followed behind, introduced himself to their new acquaintance. Once she got her bearings in the new surroundings she headed down the hall of rooms looking left and right for the correct number. Occasionally there would be an open door and she would glance in it out of curiosity. <br><br>“I was beginning to think you might not make it, Orville, but you got here just in time!” Telrien said, then leaned in closer to Aquara.<br><br>“Don't be afraid to interrupt him. If you don't, he could go on like that for at least half an hour. ” She whispered to her and came to a halt in front of her door. <br><br>“Well, this is my stop.” Telrien entered the room. Seeing no one else was there, plopped down on one of the beds with a sigh and set down her bag on the floor. <br><br>“Time to unpack!”</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Their walk was filled with the typical idle chatter that making a new acquaintance brings with it. The businessman named Sarosin had graciously offered to help Mahlon with her luggage and the two now made their way slowly through the cramped corridors of the sleeping cars. Sarosin carried the larger part of their combined belongings in a manner that appeared to Mahlon to be supremely unwieldy, but the man didn't appear to be struggling with the burden at all. She found this a little odd. Businessmen weren't generally known for their physical prowess. She bit her lip and, in the spirit of good small-talk, asked Sarosin what brought him here.<br><br>"Business," he said simply, after a slight hesitation. He cleared his throat. "Business as usual. Mixing, mingling, you know. Things of that nature -- sorry, miss." <br><br>The cabin door they had just tried opened into a room where a slender woman in a hoodie appeared to be napping. Sarosin closed the door quickly and turned to his red-headed affiliate. "I thought this was it," he said in apologetic tones. "What was your room number again?"<br><br>Mahlon flashed him her ticket, and the pair found her room at the other end of the car. Sarosin unloaded her luggage and stacked it neatly against a wall.<br><br>"Guess that's all, then," he said, flashing her an amiable smile. He reached into his coat pocket and withdrew a slip of paper, which he extended to her with two fingers. "If you need anything, don't hesitate to let me know. Be seeing you."<br><br>The door closed behind him with a click. Mahlon unfolded the slip of paper. There was a room number scribbled on it. She looked at it, then at the door. "What a nice..." She trailed off, her brow furled in thought. Later, she would revisit his pause after she asked him how he'd found himself on this train. For now, though, she had unpacking and relaxing to do.<br></div></div>

The intruders must not have stayed long, because she heard the door close soon after. Also, a normal person who stayed a while would have probably yelled in surprise at the girl melting into the bed. Unless that person was expecting her.<br><br>Rie lowered her head and peaked out from under the bed. Slowly, she phased all the way down, then quietly pulled off her heels, holding them so that she could stab someone. Her stilettos were slightly customized; Rie had replaced the normal heel with an actual metal spike then painted it black.<br><br>After a few minutes of waiting, Rie rolled out from under the bed and popped up. She looked around, then decided it was best not to wait around when the original tenant could come in again. She still didn't feel like hiding a body. The girl put her shoes back on, stepped outside, and began her quest for the bar.<br><br>------<br><br>"Oh, I guess this is nice..." Masquerade said disdainfully as she stood in the entrance of her coach compartment. <br><br>"I was expecting a bit... more, though. It was advertised as a luxury train, right?" Masquerade said to a passing woman in a brown hoodie.<br><br>Rie simply gave the masked woman the stink eye while grunting and pushing past.<br><br>Masquerade tilted her head disdainfully. "You always were so cold, Rie."<br><br>The girl froze for a moment before pushing herself through the outside wall. A moment later, she phased back in behind Masquerade, pulled the woman into a tight grip, and pressed her shoe against her neck.<br><br>"Do I know you?"<br><br>Masquerade smiled nonchalantly. "Yes, we worked together once."<br><br>Casually, the woman lifted her arm to her mask and shifted it aside. Her actual face had an expression just as blank as her mask's, and her eyes seemed to stare off at something distant. "Julia Romanesco, Saeptum Foundation. Now if you'll let me go, I'd like to see what I can do about getting myself some first class accommodations."<br><br>Rie released Julia from her grip, shrugged, then put her shoes back on before continuing her quest. Julia adjusted her mask back onto her face, checked her hair, then headed in the opposite direction.<br><br>----<br><br>"I'm sorry... ma'am, but I can't let you into first class if you didn't pay for the upgrade," an official looking man said. Behind him was the door to the single first class train car, and another car with all the other first class amenities like an open bar, a free buffet, and a jacuzzi.<br><br>"Oh," Masquerade said nonchalantly. "Very well then." She raised her hand as if to shake the guard's hand. "I should go."<br><br>Masquerade took the man's hand firmly but immediately her hand went limp, as if she were pulling away immediately, except for slight pressure from her thumb. She smiled and blinked slowly while the man looked slightly confused, and she then tapped the man's hand with her index then middle finger. The pattern continued once, when she suddenly broke it in the middle. She brought her left hand up to push the man's hand slightly upward then completely released with her right.<br><br>The man stood there, hand still outstretched, as if unsure of what was real. He looked at the masked woman, who in turn looked down at the hand as if expecting something. The man looked at his hand as well. "You have such interesting lines on your palm." Masquerade gently turned the man's palm up and started tracing the lines. The man seemed completely entranced by this, and his head even moved along with Masquerades' fingers. He giggled a little.<br><br>"Now you are in a shallow state of hypnosis. I'll be on my way." Masquerade smiled then went through the door behind the disabled man, dragging her luggage behind her.</div></div>

It's been quite a whirlwind for me of recent - I only was informed as of 2 days ago that I'd won some contest and earned a chance to ride this train for the entire duration of it's journey. Luxury accomodations, free food &amp; drink from the dining car, etc. Being that I'm not one to socialize with elite sorts and the like, to ride on a grand vehicle like this is utterly fantastic.

Out of curiosity, though, she decided to ascend the spiral staircase to the second floor of the train car.

Is something wrong or have you just had a hard day?” The young man laughed.<br><br>“Well, I suppose you could say I wasn't having much of a hard day until a certain safe decided to give me trouble.” Telrien blinked.<br><br>“A safe?” She asked stupidly.<br><br>“Mmm. Each room had one I thought.” He smiled at her and gestured for her so enter the room so he could show her the culprit. <br><br>“Huh,” She said as she bent down, yet bing mindful of her short dress, to examine the small box. “It looks kinda...bent.”  The man rubbed the back of his neck and gave her a sheepish look.<br><br>“Yeah...I'm not sure if I did that or if I just made it worse. Hey, you said your room doesn't have a safe? If you can get this one fixed, it's all yours. I'm sure there are safer places to put my stuff and I really don't feel like fiddling with it anymore. That and, well, it'd be nice to see you again during this little train ride...” <br><br>“We are right next to each other. I'm sure it would be harder not to see you again. Using the safe would be great. Thanks for the offer!” She tried to keep out most of the enthusiasm from her voice. True, it wasn't a very secure safe and true, this guy might eventually be a problem, but the gears in her mind were already turning. It was too late so slow them down.<br><br>“I guess I'll just go and see if there's someone on the train that could help me.” She said as she stepped back into the hall. “Thanks again.” The man nodded his head to her and watched her back as she left. </div></div>

Here on the coupling between this and the next car, the air was salty. Off to the west, they'd drawn near the coast. The ocean sprawled beyond. Before the sun had set the <i>King Thomas</i> would be crossing over water, and Massimo was still damned if he had the faintest idea how they'd do it.<br><br>He rested his elbows on the railing for a moment to take it in. After consideration, he drew out his cigarette case and lit up. The waft from the cig drifted idly underneath the far more productive plume from the train overhead. <br><br>Massimo stretched before taking another puff. Christ, he'd needed this. He couldn't remember the last time he'd gotten away from business in Winstone for so much as a week. He hoped the gentlemen back home wouldn't run into any trouble while he and his brothers were on vacation. So far, at least, there hadn't been any urgently whispered phone calls from untraceable booths. Although apparently Cesare had gotten a text from Ferdinando giving him hell for missing the big game. Cesare's circle of friends did take sports seriously if not much else.<br><br>Massimo flicked the cigarette off into the breeze, crossed over onto the other car, and slid open the door. "I’ve got a show in a little while, but afterwards, I’m free until..."<br><br>Why, it was the magician, or one of them, rather. Helen Mercury, that was right. She was talking to another woman with odd, elongated ears. Massimo hung back until Helen had finished introducing herself, then stepped forward as if seeing them for the first time.<br><br>"Helen <i>Mercury!</i> This is incredible. Do you -- Do you know who this woman is? She's the greatest magician of our time! I remember seeing her in... All right, all right. Acting doesn't really run in my family's veins, Ms. Mercury, I think you can tell that by now. So you're performing on board after all, is that right? I don't suppose either of us would fit in the box to get sawed in half..." Massimo nodded up at the taller woman with the ears. Neither one of them was precisely on Ms. Mercury's eye level.<br><br><i>OOC: The great thing about having planned Ishkabibble so thoroughly is that I can drop in an innocuous name like "Ferdinando" and you'll think I was just coming up with a filler character on the spur of the moment.

Allow me.</i><br><br>______________<br><br>The <i>King Thomas</i> slipped away from the platform with liquid ease, silently gliding on polished track. Sunlight glimmered off her golden rails and rods, illuminating the deep red and black of the engine's newly-christened paint. The project's commission had taken its cues from the long-dead British engineers, giving the modern magnetic-conduction train a classic steam-powered look; the powerful main cylinder belting cosmetic white steam from her fabricated boiler, resting heavily on massive cast-iron drivers, slowly cycling clockwise, urging the great machine forward. Once they hit the ocean rails the wheels would be drawn up and the EM shoes would carry the <i>Thomas</i> the rest of the way. It was a nod to the great locomotives of old, an acknowledgement of the progress that allowed the <i>King Thomas</i> to exist for the journey ahead.<br><br>Suddenly, the engine faltered, hiccuping and lurching as it slipped a gear. A rippled traveled the length of the train, trembling every car in succession until it dissipated in the caboose. In the engineer's cab, sounds of a scuffle could be heard.<br><br>'Whoa, bud. Keep that throttle down. There's no 'pedal to the metal' with these monsters!' The engineer jumped in the captain's chair, rousting his partner away from the controls, and began applying the brakes with one hand while teasing the throttle with the other. Another rumble shook the train. The engine squealed and shot forward.<br><br>'You hear that? We came off too hard at the front, and now the whole train is bouncing. Push-pull dynamic; they taught you that in motor school. We pulled, and now the train is pushing. Gotta even things out.' <br><br>Another tremor was coming - they could hear the clatter of train cars shimmying as the wave raced from the caboose on up. The engineer listened intently, waiting for the right moment. The shaking found its way to the staff cars, and he pushed the throttle forward. The engine whined in protest, but eased forward. The tremble filled the cab with a raucous noise. Then it was gone. The engine spooled back down and the train slid back into a natural rhythm.<br><br>The engineer, an older man by the name of Wallace Creed, eased back in the chair and turned to his partner, a recruit whose name he'd regarded as irrelevant - Bill or Burt or something. Creed gave him a cold stare.<br><br>'How long have you been driving trains, again?'<br><br></div></div>

Questions need not apply.<br><br>If anyone needs a new car, tell me and I'll retcon it in.<br><br>BIC: Despite all the shaking and rumbling, Nick stood triumphantly behind both Creed and the younger man. He had been monitoring everything, and nothing had gone wrong. Yet.<br><br>As a state of the art technology, and a somewhat prototype one at that, there were far more displays, dials, and flashing lights than a normal train. Having one of the senior engineers as a somewhat insane man, there were even more displays, dials, and flashing lights than necessary. Nick still made sure to look at all of them.<br><br>"You kids have it. I'm going to check the other cars before we hit the ocean."<br><br>Before anyone could agree or disagree, Nick opened the side window and jumped out.<br><br>He had a firm grasp on the bottom of the window still. With a strong heave, he pushed himself up, propelling himself onto the roof of the engine. He could have transmuted a ladder on the side of the train, but he was not going to modify his precious baby unless it was absolutely necessary.<br><br>He ran to roof of the first staff car. Seeing as he still didn't want to touch his train, he decided to just use his coat as material. He took it off and immediately a silver substance started running out of his fingers, slowly enveloping the article of clothing. Nick waited a few minutes as his nanites broke down the coat, reshaped it, and turned it into good length of rope.<br><br>The man quickly tied the rope to an exhaust pipe and his waist, and proceeded to drop down such that his head was a few inches from the tracks. Perfect height to check the mechanisms around the wheels for any problems. Anyone else would have observed the rolling green landscape, taking in how the fields rushed and blurred by while the mountains and clouds behind moved like turtles behind. Nick was more fascinated by his own machine.<br><br>He repeated this course of action to check all the sets of wheels on that particular car before moving on to the next staff car. Same check there, and same proceedure with the third. The fourth car housed the kitchen. Still required the same check of hanging upside down, but he also dropped down between the cars and used a key to open a panel by the door. Inside were more pipes, dials, and switches. It all looked in order.<br><br>The double decker first class buffet car was next. The second floor mechanisms was not his doing, but they seemed to be working fine. From the second floor extended balconies. These would retract when the train needed to go somewhere more confined, like a station. Currently, there were a couple ritzy dressed patrons sitting outside, watching the sights. A few noticed Nick. The man merely waved and smiled at them before proceeding as normal.<br><br>Next was the spa car. There was a jacuzzi on the roof. Apparently it was rude to do checks with people in the pool. Nick found that out the hard way, so he decided to just skip over the car. <br><br>Two common area cars needed checking next. From the building phase and the schematic, Nick remember that they were just cars full of chairs. Big, comfortable chairs.<br><br>Several of the first class cabins after. There was a small handful. The only thing interesting he found when checking the wheels was a young woman in a black dress and a brown hoodie walking along the car roofs too. She was pretty rude in that she didn't bother returning his cheerful hello.<br><br>Past those cars was the second class diner. Since there was no buffet here, no one saw any need to install a full kitchen. Instead there were a few stoves and ovens and whatnot inside the diner itself.<br><br>Second class a few common area cars as well. Not as comfortable chairs as first class. Nick had done extensive <s>resting</s> testing on that.<br><br>Sleeper cars and caboose last, of course. After the final check, Nick stood atop the caboose. Strange.

Despite the promises of an 'around-the-world' trip, he found nothing to suggest that the train could pass over, under or through the sea or sky.

He casually strode over to a mirror and checked to make sure everything was still intact. He had to bend quite a bit to fit all seven feet of himself into view. He smoothed his orange hair with his right hand, and released a small burst of steam from the massive brass claw that served as his left arm and hand. he then adjusted his suspenders, which hung over his dirty white shirt, and fastened to his khaki trousers. Happy that he was still in one piece, he pulled a cigar out of his pocket and lit it with the lighter that was built into his claw.<br><br>"I could get used to this."

Care for a drink while you pass the time? The cook's probably just firing up the grill; we haven't had many customers yet. I've got liquors light and dark; beer, draught and bottled; wine, from cheap to fine; as well as soda, juice, coffee, and tea. Oh, and milk too. And water, if that's your thing.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">OOC: I don’t believe Eragon has anything to deal with at the moment, seeing as how Natalie snuck off and is having a girl-talk with Emily right now. Though, by all means, feel free to have him pursuing a scene on his own or such. That is, after all, the main perk of the Luxury Rides.<br><br>BIC: “Three hundred years old? Impressive!” Orville clapped Prime on the back, smiling broadly.<br><br>“Truly, with heritage like that, it would be a shame to sully them on the issue at hand. For I am not talking about a physical threat to either of us… Far from it,” Orville sighed, cocking his head slightly.<br><br>“You mentioned a man, Nopcsa. The fellow from the Fascere Order, no?” Giguere waited until Prime affirmed the statement.<br><br>“He, unfortunately, has also taken a great deal from me. When his organization was supposed to protect my mansion…” He shook his head, and looked out the window.<br><br>“As I implied earlier, I’m a collector of fine antiquities. That’s my greatest pleasure in this life. However, those miscreants… They mislead me, and then made off with some of my most valuable possessions. The same that they were supposed to be guarding.”<br><br>His gaze snapped back to meet Prime’s, his golden eyes gleaming dangerously. It seemed that the pupils had narrowed to catlike slits.<br><br>“You’re a savvy enough traveler to know… When one has the blood of dragons in them, you do not meddle with their treasure,” Orville’s voice was a sinister growl, and there was a faint smell of smoke in the air.<br><br>“Nopcsa, one of the two men to have deprived me such, is somewhere on this train. I checked the ticket reservations.”<br><br>“If you will aid me in hunting him down, then we both may go about regaining what is rightfully ours.”<br>--------<br>“Um… Uh, hey, Emily,” Nat said, trying to shift her posture so that her friend’s shoulder wasn’t pressed against her throat.<br><br>“I’m doing okay, I guess. I’ll be doing a lot better when I get some of that steak from first class in me, though, y’know? I skipped lunch to make it here on time, so it’s been forever since-“ Natalie paused. Mentioning food or hunger around Emily was a crapshoot. Half the time, the girl would present some delicacy beyond the dreams of even professional chefs. The other half of the time, Emily would produce some bizarre concoction likely only before existing in the works of Doctor Seuss, and then use her hungry friends as guinea pigs.<br><br>“But yeah, I’m doing… Good, I guess. A few friends of mine aren’t in touch any more, but that’s just… Well, how it goes.” Natalie put a hand on the window, the glass fogging up at her touch.<br><br>“<i>Why are you so sad?</i>”<br><br>Oh boy, here it was. That was not the question she needed to be asked. But… Well, this was Emily, after all. That girl had a superhuman knack for asking those kind of things.<br><br>“Emily… Ender, you know? That guy who helped us out that one time, with the sunglasses, right? He’s…” Nat sighed, and let her shoulders slump forward. Her head banged on the glass.<br><br>“Well, he was kinda my boyfriend for a while. Sorta. And then, em, well, now…” Nat swallowed painfully.<br><br>“Now, he’s dead,” Natalie noticed Emily sagely nodding.<br><br>“No, I didn’t kill him!” She palmed her forehead. She wasn’t sure what the baker was thinking, but a key detail like that was important to get out of the way. <br>-------<br>“Greatest magician of our time? Hardly. There are hundreds, maybe thousands, that outclass me. However, the sentiment is appreciated,” Helen took a deep breath, trying to force the blush from her cheeks. Yet again, she had been singled out.<br><br>“Yes, I’m one of the many entertainers they’ve hired for the ride. I’m not really performing much these first four days, but I am doing one show each… Night, I guess you’d call it? This global travel thing does do a bit of mucking about with our normal timescheme I suppose.” Helen glanced over her shoulder thankfully, regarding a clock on the wall. A set of black hands indicated the time at the present in the Archipelago’s timezone, while another in silver was set to track the time once they got farther away. Whomever had engineered the train did not miss a single detail.<br><br>“If you’d like to be called up as a volunteer, I suppose that I could bring you up at some point. After all, I do need somebody to be the subject for my ‘invisible stairway’ trick,” Helen’s smile broadened. Using true magic for performance was not nearly as secretive of an art as sleight of hand. She could reveal whatever she’d like about her performance, and as long as nobody else had the raw magical potential required to ape her tricks, she’d be fine. Nagisa’s comment snapped her back to the conversation.<br><br>“Admittedly, I am a bit of a niche preference, so I could see how you wouldn’t know of me. I try to be as memorable as possible, but there’s only so much that can be done with live-performances.”<br><br>Helen didn’t elaborate farther. Most magicians needed some airtime on television to truly become household names. That was certainly true. But for a Power, one with rumored ties to the Summoners, no less, landing a spot on even a local news segment was borderline impossible. She could only hope that her actions here might open up something in the way of connections to friends in high places.<br><br>OOC: Ehhh, uneven post on my part, but it deals with 3/5ths of my cast on this train.<br><br>Are we going towards Asia or out into the Pacific? I had assumed into the Pacific and had been planning accordingly, but I can work with either way. I'll just reverse my "random encounters" chart a bit.</div></div>

Though, seeing as she wasn't that familiar with trains and what would be where, she wasn't really sure she was going the right way. <br><br><i> “It's either in a storage car, way in the back,” </i> she thought, <i> “or at the engine, in the front... Ugh... Never wearing heels on a train again. Never. A-gain.” </i> Her last thought was followed by a grimace as  she slipped both of the troublesome shoes off and massaged her feet for a moment before putting them back on and continuing on her way. Entering the next car, she found that it was the coach dining car. <br><br>“I knew this thing was long, but really?” she questioned under her breath. The scenery out the window caught Telrien's eye. The sky was clear with only a few clouds and the Ocean flashed by. Sighing, she slumped down on one of the seats. <br><br><i> “There's no real hurry to get the tools anyway... Maybe I really do need some decompression time.” </i> She thought absently as the view set her in a trance-like state. Her time of piece was broken, however, by the sight of Orville and some new companion of his, out of the corner of her eye. <br><br><i> “And so Mr. Eloquence returns..." </i> Telrien rolled her eyes at the thought. </div></div>

Fair enough. It hadn't really been an especially good joke anyway. He decided to change the subject.<br><br>"Maybe I can trouble Ms. Mercury to introduce you? I'm Massimo Giarrettiera.

There was a faint tapping sound overhead.<br><br>Nothing on the ceiling that would be making that noise. Something on the roof, then. Nico leaned back against the cushioned seat and tilted his head to listen with one ear. They sounded like footfalls.<br><br>In fact, given the progress of the sound from one end of the cabin ceiling to the other, it sounded exactly as if there was someone walking atop the train, crossing the roof of the car.<br><br>The tapping passed.<br><br>Without making a sound, Nico stood up off the cushion and eased the door open. He took a single step out into the hall, halved by the doorframe. He listened. The tapping proceeded down the car.<br><br>It didn't particularly occur to him why he decided to slide the cabin door shut and follow underneath this person who was walking atop the train. His curiousity had been piqued. Perhaps it was one of the two flying people from before. Nico had looked back out the window now and then, but he'd never seen them.<br><br>He hurried ahead a bit to the end of the hall and opened the door onto the next car. Again he took a single step out. The walker atop the train would pass overhead in another second. Nico pushed up his glasses.<br><br><br><i>OOC: I worry that I'm writing Shouta when I should be writing Cesare. And I can't get a lock on Massimo's voice either.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Her name would happen to be Nagisa... Davarin, was it?" Helen frowned slightly, and cocked her head. The hat moved with her, nudging open a swinging door on an overhead compartment. Helen sighed, and reached up.<br><br>Without looking, she touched the door and firmly pushed it closed.<br><br>“I swear... Cabinets and chandeliers are my mortal enemies,” She adjusted the hat once more, “And those old fashioned chandeliers, loaded up with those drippy candles? Those things are like a deathtrap for me. I've lost more hats...” She shook her head, and fell silent.<br><br>“Nothing of concern, though.”<br>--------<br>“The blood of dragons?” Prime stared into Orville's eyes. The man wasn't joking around. His gaze was steel, his expression seemingly neutral. The swordsman could still feel the seething rage coming off of the rich man, however... It was just as palpable to him as the rumbling of the train beneath his feet.<br><br>“Indeed.”<br><br>“You're not the only one with an inhuman heritage here...” Prime extended a hand to the red-clad man, revealing the design etched on his palm. Orville seized it firmly.<br><br>“Or the only enemy of Nopcsa aboard this train, for that matter,” He broke the handshake, and grabbed one of his swords lightly by its hilt. He'd be ready.<br><br>“Impressive,” Orville said, an odd smile touching his lips, “I thought you were good, but just seeing you get ready to use that sword... Impeccable! Forget what I said about it being a shame to sully that blade! No, it'd be a shame not to use it! I earnestly must say that I could not have chosen a better partner in this venture! This will not be revenge, it shall be art!”<br><br>His hands were clasped together before him, almost childlike in his glee.<br><br>“I'll go ahead, and see if I can flush out our quarry. Nopcsa can't read my mind, so it's doubtful that he'll know what's up before I lead him back to you,” Giguere trotted off without another word, his demeanor evident in his steps. He pushed into a crowd of loiterers, and was gone before prime could mutter a swear under his breath.<br>-------<br>Nopcsa sighed, glancing at the end of the line. His contacts were running late, his head ached from the constant low level mental murmur in the sheeplike masses around him, and he wasn't free to do as he pleased on one of the swankiest rides he had been on in years.<br><br>One would almost think that Auguste was intentionally toying with him. This was the sort of assignment you gave the greenhorn newbies, not the best agents on hand. Telrien was good, but she was new. This was a good mission for her. Giguere was new, too... But Nopcsa didn't even want to think about that man. All it ever did was bring to mind the ever entertaining layers of being pissed off and feeling mildly guilty about fleecing the man.<br><br>“Order?” A grudging voice smashed into his consciousness. Of course. Now that he lost in his reverie, the teenager tending to the coffee kiosk was ready for him. He halfway wanted to shoot back some remark about 'Not anymore if they keep dicking around with me like this.', but quickly thought the better of it.<br><br>“Gimme something strong and black. Like Mr. T., but a coffee.”<br><br>“Very witty,” The girl reached over and grabbed the same pot as everybody else had been getting their orders from. She jammed a lid onto the styrofoam cup, and slid it across the narrow counter.<br><br>“How much?” Nopcsa didn't need to ask, but again, pretenses. He was already unhappy.<br><br>“Two dollars and fifty cents,” The server's eyes flicked to the line behind the mindreader, and then coasted back to him.<br><br>“Wonderful. Here you go...” He scooped the cup up with his left hand, and winced. There was a streak of boiling hot coffee running down the far side from him. The change clattered brightly as he tossed it onto the counter.<br><br>“Don't worry about getting promoted to a better car with that cute sous-chef nearby. They're only looking for people who didn't f*ck up three jobs before landing here, Sunshine,” He spun on his heel, still fuming slightly. The adrenaline had been a bit much, and he had to cut himself off before he dealt any more verbal kidney punches. His hand was shaking... Oh, no, wait. That was just because the coffee burns. He took a sip, and almost spat it out. Vile stuff... Coffee with supposed to be earthy, but this one had what was almost a fecal note to it.<br><br>Granted, life in Hawaii had acclimatized him to some of the best coffee that the world had to offer, and the Fascere Order never scrimped on that detail. With operations worldwide, jetlag was the foremost complaint of almost every operative. Bar the one that was temporally displaced, but nobody cared about hi-<br><br>A clear voice sounded in his head, the most focused and direct he had heard since his last encounter with the telepath from Whelkshore. End-something or other. This guy was like that. Focused. Zen. Whatever.<br><br>And his voice said only one thing.<br><br>“I'm going to kill you, Nopcsa.”<br><br>He threw his coffee cup into the nearest ashtray. This was a bit more of an issue than getting his coffee fix. <br>-------<br>“They're getting ready to take off, judging from the way it's moving,” Thyra tried to shout loud enough for Zebedee to hear her clearly, pushing her voice to a level of volume it hadn't been heard at in a long while.<br><br>“Best to land, then, right?” Zebedee's response was nonchalant. His partner couldn't be sure exactly how he had gimmicked his voice to make it clear, but he certainly had too many ways for her to bother keeping track. He vanished, green sparks hanging in the air for a moment before dissipating in the wake of the train. A moment later, he was resting atop one of the first class cars, seated firmly despite the winds powering past him.<br><br>“Of course, don't take me along with you. Sensible,” Thyra murmured with a faint smirk. She angled her arms differently, gaining speed with an almost immediate jolt. Her altitude dipped lower, bringing her in close to the side of the car.<br><br>“Aaand...” She bit down lightly on her lower lip, and her fingertips rippled experimentally. This'd be a tricky stunt, even if it all went perfect. She let the force flowing from her left arm fade, pushing as much as she could into her right. It threw her into a barrel  roll over the back of the train, sending her tumbling past Zebedee. As she hit the far edge, she pushed her left into full power again, and let her right go quiet. With the kick from the change, she rolled back to the center. A hand caught her shoulder, steadying her. Zebedee.<br><br>“Nice flying, there,” He wasn't smiling as much as when they were flying before, but his eyes still had a bright gleam in them.<br><br>“You could have just given me a hand,” Thyra responded. Her tone was warm, despite her words.<br><br>“And denied the audience such a show of aerial supremacy?” Zebedee jerked his head slightly. She followed to movement, and spotted half a dozen first class passengers on one of the balconies, watching them. One had a camcorder.<br><br>“Zebedee!” Thyra ducked behind him, towards the front of the train.<br><br>OOC: Not liking my writing this time, but it's not bad for a return to RP after however long a hiatus, no?</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">The door slid open, and Sarosin paused to take in the sight before him. The room was virtually empty, save for a few unimportant people here and there at tables, a younger blue-haired man, and a shrouded figure reaching for a beer glass with bony fingers. Soft light twinkled off the bottles on the shelf behind the reaper, amber liquids and colored bottles gleaming like stained glass. He approached the bar, nearly reverent, and took a seat.<br><br>Motioning toward the youth's glass in a manner so as to convey he wanted the same, Sarosin pulled out his new wallet for examination. It was well-made of exquisite leather, not too stiff but not too worn. A fine donation from a wealthy contributor -- but on this train, what else was to be expected? <br><br>He thumbed the billfold open; a veritable sheaf of crisp bills fanned open to greet him, none of them smaller in denomination than a twenty. He left one of these (as a thank-you) and pocketed the rest furtively.<br><br>An ossified tap on the counter alerted him that his beverage was ready. Sarosin thanked Death most sincerely and took a sip. It was heavenly. He wondered immediately who he had to thank for this treat. <br><br>He flipped the wallet open, located the driver's license, and prepared his highest exaltations for...<br><br>Cesare Giarrettiera. <br><br>Cesare…Giarrettiera.<br><br><i>Giarrettiera.</i><br><br>Oh dear. <br><br>Hailing from the continent, Sarosin Narita knew pitiably little of the politics of the Archipelago underground. But Giarrettiera, that was a name he recognized; and unless he was quite mistaken, the Giarrettieras held a significant amount of power in the region. And here he was, holding the wallet of one of the family. <br><br>How...<br><br><i>Fortunate.</i><br><br>Sarosin snapped the wallet shut and restored it to his pocket. How absolutely fortuitous. What a better place to start his search than with they who were most likely to know of the shadier goings-on? There would be the matter of the purloined wallet to contend with, but he was confident they could smooth that over. For now, there were many things to consider.<br><br>He took another swig. Over the rim of his glass he could see the blue-haired kid again. Something about him seemed familiar, and really, how many people had such an unusual hair color? Admittedly, a lot more in the Archipelago, but...<br><br>Oh wait. <i>That's</i> why he looked familiar. Setting his glass down, Sarosin wiggled a finger in the youth's direction. "I know you," he declared with a slight grin. "Yoshimitsu, right? It's been a while, how've you been?<br><br>OOC: Edited to make it easier for BFF to respond =)</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">The orangish liquid splashed down into the glass, which made a short journey across the counter into the meaty hand of Cesare. "Thanks, pal," he said. He held up the glass. Smelled good. Reminded him of something. He couldn't tell what exactly, he was just getting <i>deja view</i>. He took a sip.<br><br>Well god damn. He'd forgotten how sweet brandy was. Hadn't had any in years. F*ck, this was the stuff. Kinda tasted like plums. Christ, and the <i>warmth</i> -- he'd felt it right away. He could hike the Himalayas with this shit! Leave the parka at home! He took another, bigger gulp. He sniffed it again. Kind of a woody smell to it maybe. From the barrel, he guessed.<br><br>Oh.<br><br>Oh shit.<br><br>Cesare took another swallow. He knew why this seemed familiar.<br><br>An image swam up in his memory: a dimly-lit underground room filled with barrels and racks full of black bottles. Everything looking taller than it should've. He'd been smaller then. Wheelman's Reserve tasted exactly like that stuff he'd gotten ahold of that time that he broke into his father's wine cellar. He was nine. He'd made Nico help him. Kid had been, what, six. They popped open the most exciting-looking bottle Cesare could find. The liquid was kinda orange, like this. Tasted just as sweet, too.<br><br>And of course, Massimo, thirteen or whatever, had taken it on himself to be the little angel and rat Cesare and Nico out. Not that he'd really <i>needed</i> to, I mean all that puke everywhere had kinda given shit away.<br><br>Cesare chuckled. He didn't know why. Just seemed funny all of a sudden. Even the part where he and Nico'd gotten a beating and lived on bread and water for three days. Even how Nico wouldn't so much as look at him for a week after that. He took another sip and grinned. That was dad. See maybe Cesare was supposed to have some Edible complex or whatever now, getting beaten as a kid and all, but f*ck, that was just his dad. Lucio Giarrettiera'd been a bastard all right, but he'd <i>known</i> how it was, the whole thing. He'd understood. And he might not have taught Nico, and he <i>definitely</i> hadn't taught Massimo, how it was, but he'd taught Cesare. Life lesson number one, father to son: rule by goddamned force. How did you run a ship? By being the hardest sonofabitch on board. If that meant knocking a couple teeth out when your sons stepped out of line, so f*cking be it. Massimo'd never figured that out. Massimo thought he could rule the organization by <i>talking</i> his way through everything. There you go. That explained what a shitty don he was. Right there in a nutshell.<br><br>Anyway the brandy in the cellar had been worth it.<br><br>He'd run the glass dry. He thought about this for a second longer than he really needed to, then he looked up at the bartender. "I'm gonna need another one of these," he declared. "Yeah. That's next on the game plan. Definitely gonna schedule a round two."<br><br>After sliding the glass back down the counter, he grabbed his wallet out of his left pocket. Or at least he tried to. Actually all he felt in there was his keys. He felt around in the other pocket. Just the cell phone. What the f*ck.<br><br>He patted all of his pockets. He looked on the counter. He looked down by his feet and out across the floor toward the staircase. No wallet.<br><br>What the <i>f*ck</i>.<br><br>"Hold up!" he told the bartender. "Hold up. Shit, I don't have my wallet. I must've..." But he'd had it when he'd left their cabin. He <i>knew</i> that! Solid fact!<br><br>The guy he'd run into.<br><br>Oh <i>shit</i>.<br><br>Cesare whipped out the cell and dialed his older brother. "Come on, come <i>on</i>," he muttered.<br><br>Massimo's voice. "Yes? What is it?"<br><br>"Mass. Get over to the bar. Not the first class one, the normal one. I need you to pick up a drink for me. Pay you back later."<br><br>"And the reasoning there is...?"<br><br>"Listen, my wallet's gone," Cesare snapped. "There's this f*cker I think stole it. Ran into him out in the hall. 'S wearin' a big tan trenchcoat. I gotta go find him."<br><br>"Okay. Understandable. Still, the usual advice about making sure he's guilty <i>before</i> you snap his neck, Ces."<br><br>"No f*ckin' promises," Cesare said, and hung up. He turned back to the counter. "Here," he said to the barkeep, "my brother's comin' by to take care of this, okay? Little guy. Mostly bald. Yellow tie. I need to go find my wallet.<br><br>"Argh <i>f*ck</i>," he added as he bounded down the stairs and pulled open the door.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">As the cumbersome <i>mafioso</i> went about scrabbling for his wallet, Creed patted his own pocket; his shirt pocket, where he'd tucked his watch. He withdrew the timepiece, a simple chain pocketwatch, trimmed in steel that was anything but stainless.  The rear cover had once born an inscription, but pitting and copper marring had all but worn it away. The glass was chipped around the edges, and hairline scratches offered a hazy view of the yellowed paper patch and aluminum dial underneath. He paused for a second, feeling the weight in his hand. He'd had this watch since his fifth birthday. This watch, for all its sordid appearances, kept perfect time. <br><br>'Ah, yeah. That'll be my cue.' He stood, making a half-hearted gesture to Kyle's bar. ' Lock everything up. We're airborne in three.' he mumbled as he made his way forward towards the engine.<br><br>_________________________<br><br><br>'Awright, Brent, move it on over.'<br><br>The kid had clearly been hoping Wallace would return - the pallid look on his face told the old wheelman that he had no idea what to do once they ran out of track. But then again, who did? Trains ran on rails, with <i>wheels</i>. They had one direction: forward. Who taught aeronautics to conductors? <br><br>Creed settled into the pilot's seat and began flipping switches.<br><br>'Sit back, Bob. Take a load off. Learn something.' he chuckled as he eased a dial back, elliciting a low <i>thrum-thrum</i> from deep within the engine.<br><br>As Creed worked, the <i>King Thomas</i> began to tremble and groan as the locomotive made the necessary transformations from railcar to air transit. The heavy diesel in the nose closed its valves, separating the block from the central camshaft and shifting the engine to its new purpose: assisting the 72-cylinder nitromethane workhorse nestled inside the length of the locomotive's cylindrical body. With no motor spinning the axles, the train was coasting along, slowly but surely losing speed. It would not be a significant change, and by the time the jets fired for takeoff, it wouldn't even matter.<br><br>A great blast of steam and hydraulic exhaust shrieked from shutoff valves as the body cylinder split into six equal lengths, fanning out and sliding back to reveal the billeted steel exhaust pipes that would vent the nitro's explosive gases into the atmosphere and help cool the monstrous engine. <br><br>Creed reached up above and flipped a series of toggles. Runners along each car began to slide and shift into place, forming tapered wingtips that would help keep each car upright and streamlined. The train continued to roll, and the twinkle of blue water could now be seen on the horizon. 'Runnin' low on track here, ain't we?!' the conductor cackled, punching more switches. <br><br>A stacatto of shrill popping noises, like a gun shooting steel rivets, echoed along the length of the train as the couplings holding the wheels in place let go and retracted. Once the train was airborne, the wheels would fold up into the undercarriage and be stored until needed.<br><br>A red light blinked overhead. Wallace smirked. Time to use it or lose it. He grabbed the hand radio from its cradle and held it against his stubbled lips.<br><br>'<i>Ahh... this is your captain speaking. In approximately sixty seconds we will be making our transition from surface to air travel. At this time the crew of the </i>King Thomas<i> would like to ask that all passengers take your seats and buckle your safety belts, as we may experience slight to moderate turbulence upon takeoff. Please make sure all bags and belongings are securely stowed either beneath your seats or in the labeled baggage compartments. Again, we will be airborne in sixty seconds, so all passengers please take your seats. Thank you.</i>'<br><br>He hung the radio back and glanced at Brock. 'Sounds reeeaaal professional, don't it? They don't teach that in train school, that's for sure.' He turned back to the controls, placing his hand on a chrome and vinyl-wrapped throttle. He eyed it carefully. The red light blinked faster, and a warning klaxon began to peal quietly. <br><br>'You ready for this, Burt?' He was staring straight ahead, completely focused. His young co-pilot was glued to his seat, ashen and trembling. <br><br>Creed smiled. 'Yeah, me neither, kid.' <br><br>The red light flashed green. Wallace slammed the throttle forward.<br><br><br><br><br>There was a terrible silence. The train shuddered and went silent, gliding on the rails with a ghostlike calm.<br><br><br><br><br>Then the nitro ignited.<br><br>A sound, like the end of the universe, only louder, erupted from the engine. Great flumes of shimmering air leapt from the violently shaking exhaust, gouting one hundred feet into the sky as the locomotive suddenly lurched forward, carrying its passenger cars along with it with an unexpected burst of speed. The sound pulverized Creed's gut, chattering his teeth and pounding his eyes like pinballs. Everything was vibrating, slamming together, beating an impossible tempo. The train moved faster, and faster. The noise increased in pitch and intensity as the <i>King Thomas</i> neared liftoff.<br><br>Just when Creed thought he wouldn't be able to take any more of the tremendous noise, the train groaned and eased skyward. There was a secondary rattle as the wheels began to fold inward as each car slowly rose off the track, and soon the whole of the <i>Thomas</i> was airborne, snaking into the clear blue Pacific sky like a great steel dragon. A yellow light blinked, and Wallace slid the throttle back to halfway, cutting the horrendous engine roar down to a low grumble. His ears were ringing, bad. His teeth hurt. He'd never had more fun in his life.<br><br>He looked at Burt, who had turned the color of spoiled eggs.<br><br>'<i>Goddamn</i>, that's fun!'<br><br><br><br></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Yoshimitsu's eyes flickered to the door when it slid open, watching a familiar figure walk in. It wasn't surprising that he'd see someone he recognised, all things considered. He couldn't quite place this man, however, so his gaze lingered for a few moments. The man walked over to the bar. Not wanting to appear creepy or inappropriate, Yoshimitsu averted his eyes quickly and looked around the rest of the room. Once he was certain the not-quite-a-stranger was preoccupied, he turned his head very slightly to look at him again.<br><br>Now that was interesting. The man was taking out some form of identification. It was highly unlikely he was going to get carded. Unless he was just confirming it was still there... But that wasn't right either. A brief look of surprise, then interest shot through the man's features. Yoshimitsu thought a little harder, choosing to look away again. Now where was this man from...<br><br>Oh, of course. Sarosin.<br><br>Just as he came to this conclusion, Sarosin beckoned him. With a small smile, Yoshimitsu approached the no-longer-a-stranger.<br><br>"Sarosin, hey," he greeted. "I've been alright. Same as ever with me, really. Back to the chaotic old life. How about you?"</div></div>

Actually, it was more than just a plain dark look, she decided, it was more murderous than anything else. She hadn't been quite close enough to hear the whole exchange, but she knew enough to assess  it was definitely time for her to retrieve some things she had in storage.<br><br>Rising casually from her seat as to not draw attention, she walked the rest of the way to the storage car. The door to it was locked, but Telrien made short work of it and was soon inside within a few moments. She winced as she saw all the other bags that had been put in storage. <br><br>"At least I decided to put it all in the yellow case. There can't be <i> that </i> many of those." but as she looked at the pile of luggage it was apparent that at least a few people had had the same idea.<br><br>"Time is a little pressing, but who knows, maybe I'll get a little something outa this." Grabbing the closest yellow case to her, she started "investigating". "Snooping" just didn't sound as professional. Opening it she found to both her disappointment and maybe a bit of excitement, that it wasn't hers. <br><br><i> "Might as well..." </i> A childish glint flashed in her eyes. <br><br>About five minutes and three yellow bags later, Telrien had a wallet, 200 dollars, a nice looking watch and her very own yellow bag. She emptied the content, putting it into an easier to carry, black bag and exited the scene. Turning she made sure to lock the door behind her before continuing a little more brusquely toward where she'd come.<br><br>Everything seemed to be about the same as it had been when she left the dining car. Except for a little more commotion over by the bar. Apparently some guy had been robbed by someone in a trenchcoat. <br><br><i> "What did he expect wearing that fancy tie? It pretty much screams 'I have money!'" </i> She rolled her eyes as he continued his rant. <i> "In any case, I need to keep my eye out for the others of my trade. I'd feel kinda dumb if I didn't see it coming." </i><br><br>Just as Telrien was about to move into the next car, a voice over the intercom blared over the noise of the chatting people.<br><br>"In approximately sixty seconds we will be making our transition from surface to air travel..." A confused expression planted itself on Telriens face. <br><br>"You're got to be kidding me. Trains aren't meant to fly."

Delicious.<br><br>Just as he was taking a second bite, Nick heard a clear chiming sound. They were going to hit the water soon. Oh no! This burger was so good. He could not leave it just to make sure the train got into the air safely. Besides, Creed knew what he was doing. Yes, yes. Everything would be fine.<br><br>Nick continued to to eat. He briefly thought about making a seat belt, but then he remembered they were already installed. <br><br>---<br><br>"We're going airborne? I thought that was just a marketing trick," a well dressed woman said.<br><br>Masquerade stood within conversation distance of her, mostly due to the fact that they had been conversing before the announcement. "I was just thinking the same thing."<br><br>"It's probably just some kind of stunt."<br><br>"We might as well sit, anyway. These chairs look comfortable enough. Also they might get a little enthusiastic about simulating turbulence."<br><br>The two were standing by the larger than normal windows in the first-class lounge car. They sat down in the large, leather seats, which were situated in angled pairs. The train made a slight turn, and the new view showed that everyone aboard the vehicle was indeed headed toward the sparkling ocean.<br><br>"Oh my. Maybe we're actually doing it," the woman said.<br><br>Masquerade merely smiled and nodded, reclining back in her first-class lazy boy.<br><br>---<br><br>Rie had no idea what the train was up to. She had her eyes on the prize. Nothing could stop her. She made a small leap to the next car.<br><br>Doola doo doo doola doo doo doola doo doo daaa.<br><br>The girl stopped and looked down. A young man with glasses had just shut his phone. He was looking right at her. "Why are you up there?"<br><br>Rie stared at him. Her eyes were cold; her expression was neutral. <br><br>So was his.<br><br>"I want to get to the open bar."<br><br>With that, she briskly turned around and continued her quest forward, noticing how close the train was getting to the ocean. Strange. Someone had mentioned before they left that the <i>King Thomas</i> had some gimmicks to it. Was flying over the water one of them? Rie mentally shrugged and took another step forward before almost losing her balance as the entire train began shaking.<br><br>Rie watched with slight amusement as the train engine began ascending. The cars behind it followed suit, and the girl calculated about 25 seconds before her car came off the tracks. She stepped out of her shoes and picked up the reinforced heels.<br><br>Ten more seconds. The girl began running, her bare feet making light thumping noises on the metal. The car in front of her angled upward, following its predecessors into the sky. Rie jumped.<br><br>On contact, she briefly phased her entire body, minimizing the sound of impact, and she slammed her stilettos into the roof. Their sharpened points and metal-reinforced, also aided by the quick phase, penetrated car top. Without the improvised hook, Rie might have slid back due to the train's acceleration and upward angle.<br><br>Only one more car to go. She reached up with her shoe and phased the heel into the roof a bit higher. She then removed the previous heel out of the roof and continued her crawl/climb. Had this been a cheaper train, the roof would have probably been made with a thin sheet of metal, leaving pinholes in the ceiling. It was not a cheap train, thankfully.<br><br>Just as Rie reached the end of her current car, the train stabilized and began gliding smoothly over the water. The girl stood up, putting her shoes back on. She dropped down between cars and opened the door. Inside, several people milled around. They gave her strange looks.<br><br>"Hello Death. Vodka and red bull."<br><br><font size="2"><font face="times">SURE THING. BY THE WAY, YOUR HAIR IS ALL OVER THE PLACE.</font></font><br><br>"Oh."</div></div>

This would later prove to be a fantastic gathering spot for other characters in the story but since the Don had accepted the thankless task of paying for his brother's drink, and was therefore headed like everyone else toward one of the two bars aboard the <i>King Thomas</i>, we will not be able to explore the rec room in any further detail just now. The mere fact of its existence will hopefully be an adequate narrative element to add at the moment.<br><br>* * *<br><br>Nico sat up. He had been saved from being thrown off the train at liftoff by the fortuitously timed automatic extension of an accordion-like canvas over the connector between the two train cars. Now, in this tiny flourescently lit tunnel of plastic, he was hurtling over the earth at an altitude to rival that of an airplane. His head was spinning somewhat. He drew himself very slowly onto his feet and slid open the door ahead.<br><br>The buffet car. No one had vomited yet as far as Nico could smell. Actually the lids were just now being pulled away and already queues had formed. Excitement, Nico supposed, stimulated the appetite. He sat down firmly at the nearest unoccupied table, removed his glasses, produced his handkerchief, and set to wiping them clean. The floor kept re-angling itself but eventually it managed to hold its stillness.<br><br>His thoughts swerved sickeningly back to the woman with short blond hair who had been crossing the roof of the train.<br><br>Of course Nico would have had more time to wonder whether she had been hurled off the traintop at liftoff if a fuzzy figure with the same basic shape and coloration as the woman had not come into his field of view from the door on the opposite end of the room. He replaced his glasses. Yes, it was her.<br><br>Her gait was distinctly unsteady. However she had gotten back inside the train, she didn't seem to have weathered the liftoff any better than Nico had.<br><br>When she approached the buffet, he caught her eye.

As random happenstance would have it, the bespectacled guy stopped her right behind a rather large, garishly dressed woman. This woman was not too pleased. Maybe she was very hungry and didn't like lines, or maybe her theoretical husband had just given her Bad News. Or maybe she was very surprised by a train taking off into the air so that it could hover above the ocean.<br><br>Rie didn't particularly care. Hypermetabolism coupled with now-apparent drunk munchies meant that she just wanted this woman to stop fidgeting and get on with the line. There were lobsters to be had.<br><br>Tunnel vision wouldn't be the best way to describe it. It was probably the training; even with things uncomfortably, though not debilitatingly, out of focus, Rie couldn't fixate on an object. She was still completely aware of everything in her peripheral vision. A couple of excited children running around and looking out the windows as the ocean sped bye; some yuppy gent texting madly on his iPhone; the unbearably long line of people at the other buffet table. Oh, and the bespectacled guy was still standing next to her. <br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler5773383').toggle();if($('#spoiler5773383').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler5773383">OOC: loooooooool it's like i don't know how to write<br><div class="quote" timestamp="1278655011" source="/post/56624/thread" author="@pohatufan1"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-10" title="Beelzebibble"><img src="http://s28638.storage.proboards.com/3328638/a/DQ7bJ6Gp3mCoPK2bkorF.png" alt="Beelzebibble Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/56624/thread"><abbr data-timestamp="1278655011000" title="Jul 8, 2010 19:56:51 GMT -5" class="o-timestamp time">Jul 8, 2010 19:56:51 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/10" class="user-link user-10 group-5" itemprop="url" title="@pohatufan1"><span itemprop="name">Beelzebibble</span></a></span> said:</div><i>OOC: lololol especially how you keep using "bespeckled" as if it means "bespectacled"</i><div class="quote_clear"></div></div></div><div class="quote" source="/post/56625/thread" timestamp="1278655727" author="@ch00beh"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-8" title="ch00beh" style="border-color: #666699;"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v487/Andurin/e109900a-d9c0-455e-9a18-7b21ddc48211_zps3cc7bef1.jpg" alt="ch00beh Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/56625/thread"><abbr data-timestamp="1278655727000" class="o-timestamp time" title="Jul 8, 2010 20:08:47 GMT -5">Jul 8, 2010 20:08:47 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/8" class="user-link user-8 group-2" itemprop="url" title="@ch00beh" style="color: #666699;"><span itemprop="name">ch00beh</span></a></span> said:</div>OOC: I have no idea what you're talking about dumb dumb.<div class="quote_clear"></div></div></div></div></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Prime weathered the turbulence of the train lifting off silently. His legs tensed slightly against each rocking, seemingly accustomed despite never having been in a similar predicament before. A woman nearby teetered on her high heels, and then fell sideways a shriek. <br><br>“Mind yourself,” Prime had interposed between the dilettante and the plush carpeting, sparing her an undignified plunge, “It's going to be bumpy for a bit.”<br><br>He raised her back to her feet, and stepped away.<br><br>“Thank you!”<br><br>“No need to thank me...” Prime put a hand on the hilt of one of his blades reflexively and glanced around the car. Nobody wearing a white cloak, though a few white dress shirts tweaked his attention for the slightest of instants.<br><br>“But if you've seen a man with dark hair and wearing a white cloak... I've been missing his company,” Prime's lip twitched slightly.<br><br>“A cloak? Oh, of course I'd remember something like that! Even around the Archipelago, most people don't wear stuff like that,” The woman smiled genially, “There was one two cars towards the back.”<br><br>“Okay, that's good then. I suppose that I should be thanking you, Miss,” Prime nodded slightly, and then walked past her. <br><i>I already went through the three cars at the very end of the train. There's no way that I missed him.</i><br><br>Prime glanced out the window, at the coastal terrain they were smoothly gliding past. The sun was shimmering on the ocean below, dancing and sparkling with perfect clarity. The swordsman closed his eyes for a moment, and exhaled. The beauty of the day, the luxury of the ride... It was superfluous. He'd promised Giguere that he'd be catching Nopcsa. That's what he'd do. Alive, or in pieces. It was all the same, considering the kind of person that was his quarry.<br><br>With perfectly measured strides, noiseless upon the masterfully woven carpet, he neared the back of the car. The door opened at his touch, and he stepped into the area betwixt the two enclosures. A pressurized seal had slid over the juncture, leaving it feeling the same as being inside one.<br><br>That disappointed him, really. He'd have liked to feel the ocean wind whipping through his hair. Maybe he'd sneak up topside after this was done. With his elbow, he gingerly swung the next door open. It glided like a dream, perfectly oiled and calibrated. There was a fairly large crowd of people in the middle, seemingly gathered in a spirited discussion of international politics. Lovely. He'd expected the people towards the caboose to be more laid back, but then again, this was the party for rich boys and girls to flaunt exactly how undeservedly wealthy they were.<br><br>“Hey, sexy,” A tenor voice piped up as a hand lightly fell upon Prime's shoulder from behind, taking hold of the fabric of the suit. He didn't need to turn. His body responded for him, throwing an elbow back with enough force to shatter concrete. It brushed against cloth, missing the retreating body by a hair's breadth. No matter. Prime's arm unfolded at the elbow, snapping into a vicious backhand as he turned to face the man. It clipped the figure's chin, leaving a bloody scuff.<br><br>“Gee, just because you can't accept complements is no reason to respond with physical violence,” The man grinned widely, and wiped the crimson from his face with napkin he already had at hand. Though there was a trio of large scars stretching down from his left cheekbone, it was otherwise the same man that had been there in Hawaii.<br><br>“Nopcsa,” Prime growled, and lunged forwards. He grabbed for the collar of the mindreader's shirt, only to have it tugged out of his reach.<br><br>“Mr. Elder. Or is it Magnus? I really didn't get that straight-” Nopcsa ducked a left hook, cocking his head just enough to let it blow past him harmlessly, “Last time we met. Of course, I probably should have bothered to check when we were-” He jumped back, moving as one with the punch that Prime sank into his gut. With a grunt, he landed three paces back.<br><br>“Taking everything I owned?”<br><br>“Yeah,” Nopcsa's grin mutated into some sort of hybrid between a beaming smile and a smirk, “That one. The one where we left you totally screwed over and penniless.”<br><br>His white cloak fluttered as he backstepped, letting Prime's blade whistle through the air between them. It clipped the embroidery of his dress shirt, flinging two sequins into the air. One split in half as it fell to the floor.<br><br>“Oh, come on, REALLY?” Nopcsa's smirk receded almost instantly, “You weren't supposed to whip those out until about two minutes from, according to my boss.”<br><br>He hopped briskly, as if skipping a rope, and avoided a swing that would have taken him off at the knee.<br><br>“But then again, that's what she said,” He stepped closer to the swordsman, and spun aside as Prime attempted to strike him with the pommel of the blade.<br><br>“How can you not take this seriously? You people ruin lives, desecrate sacred places! You treat other people like vermin, just to make a quick buck!” Prime's voice was a feral snarl, his eyes gleaming dangerously.<br><br>“Yeah, that falls under that whole 'not taking this seriously' bit. I mean, really. Kinda like th-” Nopcsa stepped away from his hunter, and stumbled over the trash can behind him. The Fascere Operative landed hard on his back, halfway against the wall. He choked out a curse as Prime closed the distance, raising his weapon.<br><br>“This was less trouble than I thought it would be, Nopcsa.” Prime said, meeting Nopcsa's gaze with his own void of emotion. This wasn't the time to be enjoying this. Justice was one thing, sadism another.<br><br>“Oh, I know. But hey, Giguere's always talking out his ash,” With that, the mindreader kicked over the can, spilling its ash tray full of boiling coffee onto Prime's legs. The swordsman seemingly brushed aside the pain, and swung.<br><br>CLANG!<br><br>The blade slammed into the metal of the can, cleaving a good two thirds of the way into the receptacle.<br><br>“Yeah, that didn't work so wonderful. Was hoping I'd break one of your precious swords, but-” Nopcsa tumbled aside as Prime's blade ripped the rest of the way through, and was on his feet in a moment.<br><br>“Anyways, gotta be going. Other people to piss off, other valuables to pilfer. Y'know, life as usual,” Nopcsa threw the door to the car open, and dove through. Prime was after him in an instant, lunging into the aperture bladefirst. He was met with the heavy, well oiled door slamming on his arm.<br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler8319046').toggle();if($('#spoiler8319046').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler8319046">Eh, I think I favored Nopcsa a bit too heavily here.

Always the same, observe the powers. Why couldn't he get a nice, get very drunk and pass out naked on the table mission? Or go to a rave and just have some fun?<br><br>"Bluhhh," he muttered. In the room right now, he could see two. Pictures had been printed off, depicting all of the powers that should be present. Right now, he could see Rie and Yoshimitsu. One was leaving the room, the other conversing at the bar. Nothing noteworthy. Good. It meant Felix didn't have to think too much right now.<br><br>Without any consideration for any rules, he pulled a spliff from his pocket and lit it. </div></div>

But seriously... if what you say could possibly be true... w-wow..."<br><br><i>Nagisa's mighty dragonic heart was now pounding from her being rather excited, and she wondered if it was making the Phoenix Ruby pendant bounce noticeably on her chest from the force of its pumping... (which would certainly be quite an odd sight to see, being that it'd make the heartlike jewel seem as though it were beating itself).</i></div></div>

This was unexpected. He gave her another beat. No, none. She was staring at the plate of lobsters. It fell upon Nico exceedingly uncharacteristically to bear the weight of conversation. No subject leaped to mind. How meltingly awkward. He remembered his cell phone. He frowned. "You've been moving round and about the train, then," he said, and if it had been that much of a question he would have framed it as such. "Have you seen a dickwad in a trenchcoat?"<br><br>* * *<br><br>The dickwad in the white cloak burst out of the caboose door and ran straight into Cesare.

That was probably the closest thing Rie had to a motto. It didn't provide a good baseline for socializing.<br><br>Also, forcing a conversation (which fit under the 'unpleasant' part of her motto) would totally kill her buzz.<br><br>The girl's mind was racing, trying make a plan to get away from this guy. There were too many people between her and the food, so she couldn't pretend she didn't hear him by banging on the chafing dishes with a lobster. There was the option of fleeing completely, but if she phased through the floor she would lose her spot in line. She could kill everyone... but they would probably stop serving her. Plus she would have to take off her shoes to wield as weapons and that would take time during which time anyone in the room could shoot a fireball and also some kid spilled soda on the floor and that would just be terrible to walk through barefoot.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">“You can’t eat only pudding.”<br><br>“I <b>can</b> eat only pudding. It’s unhealthy and decidedly impractical, but I could suck down pudding for this whole trip,” Lacianus leaned back casually in her seat, resting against the red cushioning. She brought another spoonful to her lips, keeping it precisely level despite the shaking of the vehicle.<br><br>“That… That’s true, I guess. But you wouldn’t,” Berthold retorted. His hands were resting on the table. After a moment, he fidgeted, and put them in his lap. No, that looked improper… He hopelessly shoved his hands in the pockets of his shiny black suit jacket, and glanced over.<br><br>A blonde man, roughly the same size as him, was seated with a royal casualness to his pose. His hair was trimmed short, hinting at supposed discipline, an idea enhanced by the large, dour looking shades hiding his eyes. He was paying little attention to the gourmet pizza on the plate in front of him, simply tracing the contour of the islands in the distance. His fingertip’s heat fogged the glass, leaving a vague outline of the view from moments ago.<br><br>“I totally would. Heck, I totally would just to prove you wrong. All this pudding, made from scratch? That’s just gravy. Pudding. Not gravy pudding, but-“ Lacy decided the better of continuing this train of thought, and carefully bisected a clot of the desert on her plate. With a mechanical twist of her wrist, she turned it 90°. A moment later, the spoon was in her mouth again.<br><br>“And you’d miss out on all of the different things they’re offering? Bavarian pastry things, French cheeses, all sorts of Italian stuff, all the Chinese you can eat-“ Berthold smiled vaguely. Even though he’d had a gigantic cheesesteak with the freshest vegetables he’d tasted in weeks, all the food talk was getting him hungry again, “Boston cheesecake.”<br><br>“That- Okay, yeah, screw the pudding. At least, screw the pudding when I’m done with this plate. Switching to all range mode,” Lacianus dipped her spoon, and swept it around her plate in a perfectly circular motion. There was no noise of the silverware scraping the china. She raised the vanilla-chocolate mélange to her lips, and downed it. Berthold couldn’t help but envy her. Despite his much more ergonomic choice in food, he’d experienced the unique sense of dread that came from sauce dripping onto expensive clothing.<br><br>Lacianus, and for that matter, the fairly conservative black dress she wore, were immaculate. Even her plate was sparklingly clean now.<br><br>Without saying a word, George pulled his hand away from the window, and clenched it into a fist.<br>--------<br>“Hey, Thyra, are you seeing what I’m seeing?” Zebedee was seated on the roof of the train, scratching absentmindedly at some holes punched in the metal while looking dead ahead. Rays of golden light danced around him, moving like seaweed in the ocean currents below.<br><br>“Yes. Yes and no,” Thyra Russell was still standing, her hair pushed straight back by the wind resistance. Her dress remained mostly in order, the weights sewn into it and a few concealed straps doing their jobs well. She’d planned for flying at some point, albeit not quite this early in the voyage.<br><br>“So, you see a little ragamuffin type hanging halfway down the smokestack, and shouting happily?” Zebedee glanced back for just a moment, attempting to meet her gaze, only for his bangs to blow into his eyes, “Is he like delirious with asphyxiation, or are we talking something much more fortunate, and much more weird?”<br><br>“It’s… More fortunate than that, I’d say. He’s a friend of mine. One of-“ Thyra paused significantly, “<i>Us.</i>”<br><br>“Yeah, kinda figgered he was a Power. What’s his deal?” Zebedee pushed off of the roof, rising to his feet. His tie flapped up, slapping him in the face.<br><br>“He’s… Not exactly the easiest person to explain. If you could explain him in the first place, and if he <i>is</i> what you could call a ‘person’. I think that the best way to elucidate would be a demonstration,” Thyra found herself smiling at her friend’s uncertain glance. This would be an experience, no matter how it turned out.<br><br>“Those are exactly the kind of words I don’t like to hear. It usually involves me needing to get my racquet right afterwards.”<br><br>“You should! He’d like that a lot, I’d wager.”<br><br>Zebedee bit his lip slightly, and then raised one hand (using the other to restrain his tie, naturally). Green sparks flew back in the wind, vanishing before the weapon had even appeared. When it did, it caught the sunlight, throwing a suncat halfway up the back of the next car. It was slightly shorter than Zebedee’s arm, with a sleek, kiteshaped frame. Along the edges, triangular diamond blades were stationed like thorns on a rose. The center was a singular mirrored surface, standing out against the painted blue titanium.<br><br>He twirled it with his fingertips, turning it so that the wind didn’t catch it.<br><br>“Let’s go see your friend, then,” He brought the weapon up, resting it lightly against his shoulder. He made sure his grasp was just right, keeping the bladeless handle from slipping and bringing the diamond shards to bear on himself.<br><br>“Let’s,” Thyra raised one hand in greating, and then shouted (or rather, spoke loudly. But for Thyra, this was most certainly the equivalent of yelling), “Hey, Rhometer!”<br>------<br>Helen nodded slightly when addressed, but she had been quite lost in thought for a while now. Masquerade seemed to be bringing much more focus to the conversation than she had earlier, and every word had underlying notes to it. This woman wasn’t talking on the normal level… It seemed everything was subtextual with her.<br><br>Would she pick up on some underlying guilt of Helen’s? Maybe she’d analyze the way she said “Summoners”, and dissect that into a known association with a terrorist group? It was certainly a dangerous possibility.<br><br>It’d be best to get away from her, at least while she was like this. Maybe when the woman was preoccupied or had a few drinks, but when she was a hawk watching the mice, it was stupid to stick around.<br><br>She couldn’t just bail, though. No, that’d give Masquerade far too much of a reason to be suspicious. That might actually warrant an in depth investigation from the harlequin. That wouldn’t do.<br><br>She was stuck here, writhing uncomfortably under the eye of Sherlock Holmes. At least until another ten minutes had passed, and left her with the valid excuse of her performance for the day.<br><br>Helen needed something to keep Masquerade preoccupied until then.<br><br>“Ever have any such flings yourself?” Helen smiled knowingly, looking towards the masked woman, “I mean, it sounds like you’re speaking from personal experience.”<br><br>“So, how was it?” She hoped she could buy herself a few more minutes. That'd be enough to regroup and gather her senses. Maybe she'd be able to pick the next battle better.</div></div>

The killer's head whipped back against the wall and a satisfying crunch told Cesare he'd broken the killer's nose.

Massimo wondered idly whether the middle Giarrettiera might in fact have flushed the wallet down the toilet. He couldn't call it unlikely.

He always had multiple plates floating around, and then when he was done, he would memory wipe anyone who saw. Not for the first time that day, Rie wished things were that simple again.<br><br>The girl snapped out of her reverie when she noticed that her plate was getting heavy with lobsters. Apparently her hand knew exactly what it was doing and didn't need any help from her brain. Convenient.<br><br>Rie exited the line and made her way to an empty table when she noticed a little girl eating copious amounts of pudding. The way the girl ate was almost mechanical in her precision. No wasted movements, perfection in cleaning the plate. The ghost was reminded of something or someone familiar...<br><br>Pudding. Yes. That was it. Hypermetabolism loved pudding. Lots of calories in the form of carbohydrates that could be burned quickly and efficiently.<br><br>Rie turned around mid-step to look at the dessert table, almost losing her balance again. Oh. That power killer was pretty great.<br><br>When she regained her composure (it was pretty quick), she noticed that the dessert table was empty. Sober, she probably wouldn't have looked at it in the first place and would have just started on her lobsters. In her current state, it was only logical to get some dessert before everyone else made a stupid line.<br><br>Rie went for the table, picking up a second plate and started piling the deliciously sweet, calorie-packed cakes and puddings on it without having to wait for a slow elderly couple or a uncoordinated child. She was in and out within thirty seconds, now armed with a plate in each hand. Upon turning around, she stopped.<br><br>The table she was going to sit at was taken.<br><br>The place was fairly packed as it was. There didn't look like there was any more open seating... wait, there. No. Someone took it.<br><br><s>Dammit. That bespectacled guy was standing right next to it. Rie looked down at her food, then back up at the table. She almost sighed before weaving her way in that direction.<br><br>The guy turned to look at what was approaching from his periphery, only to find Rie's stare once again. The girl didn't say a word. She just put her food on the empty table and sat down.<br><br>"The other tables were taken."</s><br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler2454823').toggle();if($('#spoiler2454823').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler2454823">OOC: WOOPS CONTINUATION FOLLOWING</div></div></div>

It would only be proper Science to attempt the same test with a different variable.<br><br>Now what was that beverage he had before... vodka cranberry? Yes, yes.

Berthold wasn’t really sure if what it was she was carrying. He had a small handgun in the inside pocket of his jacket, and a can of pepper spray strapped to his leg.<br><br>Upon espying his preparations, George had laughed disparagingly. He’d furnished something for Lacianus, though it could be anything from high-powered explosives to some bizarre bladed weapon to an unfolding mechanical suit to some manner of gun. The Obsidian Hearts did love their unusual weaponry so…<br><br>A beep, in his ear. It was enough to make him jump.<br><br>Lacianus, meanwhile, was lapping away at her spoon unperturbed. George twitched his lips for a moment, but continued looking towards the window.<br><br>"Berthold, Lacianus, can you hear me? Where are you guys?"<br><br>Ah, good. Arnold. A bit more normal than his peers, fortunately. It’d be good to help him make his way up here quickly. Maybe he could have normal conversation which wasn’t about mechas or food, or for that matter, intentionally foreshadowing world conquest every time he opened his mouth.<br><br>“We’re in the-“ Berthold remembered what George had told him. He clenched his jaw, the pressure activating the miniature radio in his ear.<br><br>“We’re in the buffet car. Or something like that? I don’t know what class we’re in. The food’s good, though,”<br><br>“Yes, and we’re on a train. It’s not like nobody can see the commlinks we’re using or anything like that,” Lacianus retorted, pushing out her chair, “Don’t worry, we’ll just tell everybody you’re rich and schizocentric. That’ll cover any weirdness.”<br><br>She patted him on the shoulder with her free hand, the other taking the plate with her. Berthold pondered the wisdom of such an action, before realizing how precisely cleaned it had been.<br><br>“See that there?” George’s rich voice rumbled for the first time in almost half an hour. The mechanic jumped again.<br><br>“See what? I just see ocean and the Archipelago. Good view, but you aren’t the type to-“<br><br>“I always forget. Normal people, normal senses. They suck, so very badly,” George took the sugar dispenser from the table, and angled it. Precisely reflected on it, more sharply than should have been possible, was a young blonde woman. She was dressed fairly modestly, it seemed, but the few places that the skin was exposed seemed to be marred by abnormally large scars. She was wobbling ever so slightly, a tiny lurch accompanying her movements.<br><br>“Can you feel it? She’s something interesting,” George paused just long enough to let Berthold start speaking, and then cut him off, “She’s so very, <i>very</i> interesting. I want that.”<br><br>Without standing up, George was away from their table, and on his feet. He walked silently, the air rippling around him as if it was coming off a flame. He ignored the other two at the bar judiciously, regarding them as one would flies. His shades adjusted their position on his nose without being touched, taking on a reflective sheen.<br><br>“Hello,” He put his hand on her shoulder, “What are you?”<br>-------<br>“Oh, I’m afraid I’ve got little time for anything else,” Helen tried to smile more openly, letting her posture drop slightly. She shouldn’t force being casual, but being too tight lipped would only bring Masquerade’s curiosity to bear.<br><br>“There’s been a few men I’ve met who might’ve been something, but they tend to come and go. You know how it is in the Archipelago. One day he’s talking like you might be the only one for him, and then the next, he flies away on the back of a flaming dragon, and you don’t see him again for four years.”<br><br>Helen smiled genuinely now.<br><br>“And then he shows up again, and he’s a totally different guy, and acts like everything in the past never happened. I’ve seen that one happen quite a few times,” She leaned an elbow against the wall. She had her rhythm with her again.<br><br>“I guess it’s what you should expect. People come here…” She glanced towards the back of the train. They really weren’t in the Archipelago any more.<br><br>“There. People go there to get away from themselves and their pasts. Why should we think they’d do anything different when it comes to interacting with us?”<br><br>“Maybe I should find some spell to make people responsible… Though that’d certainly need to be the greatest magic I’ve ever worked.”<br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler5520969').toggle();if($('#spoiler5520969').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler5520969">OOC: Pohatu, where are youuu?</div></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Vodka cranberry it is, then." Kyle took the dishes and placed them into the dumbwaiter below the bar to send them to the kitchen staff then shuffled over to one of the freezers to find a suitable vodka.<br><br><i>Well, I want to give him a good cocktail but there's not much involved with a drink like this. He's either not one for alcohol or he really loves cranberry juice. In either case, I'll want to go with a vodka that won't stick out from the mixer so the Smirnoff in the well is out. Normally I'd go with one of the more expensive brands but Ketel One and Stolichnaya Elit have a bitterness that will only be amplified by the tart taste of the cranberries. Grey Goose is for people who don't know anything about vodka but want a name they can drop to show people how much more their drink cost. It's swill and this guy doesn't seem like the type to care about a label anyways. We'll go with Tito's on this one; it's as close to flavorless as you can get and it's been a favorite with nearly everyone I've served.</i><br><br>Kyle stood back up with the frosty bottle as well as a bottle of cranberry juice and set them on the bar. He filled an old-fashioned glass mostly full with ice cubes and set it on a coaster in front of his patron then scooped some more ice into a shaker. Following the ice was the juice and the liquor, poured without measure. Kyle had never been a fan of bartenders that measured out every glass. It's all well and good to be precise when it comes to the more complex drinks but for simple mixers, or even neat glasses, a measured pour comes across as miserly and unfriendly, an atmosphere a bar should never have. You can have a drink anywhere; people come to a bar for a reason. It's a place for conversation and for comfort. The long pour is a symbol of generosity and kindness, a gesture of friendship.<br><br>"You know, technically this cranberry juice is a cocktail in and of itself," Kyle remarked as he closed the shaker together and shook the contents vigorously. "Sure, there's no alcohol in it but the essence of the cocktail is still there. Cranberry juice alone is exceptionally tart and acidic. This is why the most popular brands use water and sweeteners to balance out the harsh flavors. This blend of ingredients pools together to make something greater than that which went into its crafting, something familiar yet supremely unique. This is the goal of all cocktails."<br><br>Kyle removed the cap from the shaker and strained the liquid into the man's glass. <br><br>"Please, enjoy."<br><br>Kyle then turned to the man that had walked in earlier and who was now gazing out the window with a Cheshire grin.<br><br><i>I'm starting to wonder how many more Italians I'm going to see on this trip. We're just crawling all over this train.</i><br><br>"Would you like something to drink, sir?"</div></div>

Her mouth was also full of lobster, so her response sounded more along the lines of "Nrpmph." <br><br>It was a good question, though. The girl looked out the window and saw the sun beginning its orange descent. Probably an hour or two left of daylight, not accounting for train movement. Estimation of two to three hours since departure. Rie looked back at the rapidly shrinking Archipelago. At this rate she guessed that the train would hit Hawaii somewhere around midmorning the day after tomorrow, perfectly timed with most of the guests' sleep schedules for the following day.<br><br>The girl mentally shrugged then went back to work on her lobster. The shell of a single lobster had been piled onto a napkin on the table. It was clear that the knife work to get into the shells were precise; every cut was a straight line with no deviation and no jagged edges except for where impatient fingers had bent the shell out of shape. Rie was beginning her operation on a second shellfish, cutting it down the center of the tail, when a hand grasped her uncomfortably hard on the shoulder.<br><br>"Hello. What are you?"<br><br>Rie didn't stop to think. She whipped around to assess the the threat, and at the same, her knife-holding hand (the parent shoulder having been the one that was grabbed) moved faster than most eyes could follow from the table to the forearm of her assailant. It would have been a standard disarm of knocking the arm away, but instead, her hand passed through the man's arm. Once through, her hand switched directions in an attempt to stab the assailant.<br><br>Rie was completely surprised to find her wrist being grabbed instead of her knife sinking into flesh. It didn't show, however, as her arm again phased out of the material plane, losing the man's grip. The girl kicked up, phasing through the table while gripping the top of her chair, then vaulted herself upside down toward the ceiling and "landed" in a crouched position, from which she sprang at the man knife-first. He merely sidestepped.<br><br>Rie's knife sank through the floor, followed by her arm then her entire body. Clattering could be heard outside the train, and a moment later, Rie phased through the bar-side wall as if she had swung herself inside. She sailed in heel first in an attempt to spike the man, but again he simply moved aside. Rie would have crashed into her table or through the window if she hadn't phased once again out of the material plane.<br><br>More clattering, this time moving in an upward direction. The girl phased through the ceiling a few meters away then landed heavily on the carpet, her footing failing her for a moment in disorientation. Her offhand hit the ground to steady herself. Too much jumping around without actually scoring a hit. It was throwing her off. On top of that, the alcohol was not doing pleasant things to the food in her stomach. She fought the urge to think about throwing up or phasing the offending parties out of her system. It would be a waste of food and drink.<br><br>"What do you want."<br><br>At this point she noticed that the man had what would best be described as an "aura" and her vision wasn't just hazy due to alcohol.<br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler632027').toggle();if($('#spoiler632027').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler632027">OOC: Oh Rie and action sequences.

Most people would take such a simple chemical fact for granted, but I see that we're both men of the same type!"<br><br>The bartender offered the alchemist the beverage. "Thanks," Nick said. He flashed a crooked smile and took the drink.<br><br>The man took a careful sip, remembering his first time. That time had been mostly unpleasant. This one, however, was not. In fact, it tasted mostly like cranberry juice. Nick took another sip and regarded the flavor. His sensors were picking up the different ingredients, but his taste buds were not. Fascinating.<br><br>It couldn't simply be differing personnel that altered the flavor of the same beverage so much. One sodium block exploded in water just the same as a different sodium block, no matter who was throwing it in. This obviously meant it went down to the level of chemical concentrations and types as well as the method of mixing. A different person could (and probably would!) have different creationary principles. <br><br>Nick eyed the bottles behind the counter then recalled the levels that the man poured. This was new ground. He would have to ask an expert.<br><br>"I must know, how did you get this beverage to taste exactly like normal cranberry juice, Mr. ah...?"</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Castellani. I don't care for formalities, though; just call me Kyle. As for the drink, there's a little more than meets the eye."<br><br>Kyle glanced at the Italian. The man didn't appear to have heard Kyle's offer in his daydreams. <br><br><i>No need to snap him out of his reverie. I'll let him be for now.</i><br><br>Kyle focused back on Nick. "Even for a simple cocktail like this there are a number of things to consider. Most importantly is the vodka. Different brands have different qualities that come as a product of their distillation, the purity of the water used, and what is fermented to produce the ethanol. When it comes right down to it though, vodka is essentially just ethanol and water. Because of this, when it is mixed with something it tends to water down the flavors. To counteract this I use a different brand of cranberry juice than what is served plain. This one has fewer ingredients to interact with the vodka but, more importantly, it has a lower percentage of water. If you drank this as-is it would have a striking bittersweet taste that would overpower a meal but adding the vodka makes it palatable again by adding to the water content. Since water is such an important part of this drink I used large, smooth cubes of ice so that they would melt more slowly. Care also has to be taken when using the shaker so you don't chip the ice against its sides." Kyle grinned as he noticed the man was still as rapt as ever. <br><br>"You were an important factor as well. You just finished a fairly large burger and odds were good that there would still be some, pardon this image, there was probably still some grease clinging to the insides of your mouth. Taking that into account I added a little more vodka than normal. It would help cleanse your palate and, since you just ate, the extra alcohol would sit easier in the stomach. You also took small sips instead of a full drink so even though there was less of the cocktail in your mouth, it sat on your tongue for a longer period. This let the flavors come through fully and acclimated your tongue to the taste so that even larger swallows later will have as much presence as the first. That's something to keep in mind if you decide to switch drinks later; the first of the new will be colored by the last of the old." <br><br>Nick had stayed attentive through the whole of the monologue and now Kyle laughed a little at himself. "I hope that answered your question," he said with a wide smile.</div></div>

"Ivan, we are thousands of feet in the air, you have to be absolutely <i>meshugenah</i> to even sit out here!

I want to get a closer look at that crazy kid with the beat-up coat that was hopping around up front just a while ago." He glanced over towards the engine of the train, and noticed two vaguely familiar figures in the distance. "Wait a second, is that Thyra?"<br><br>"I don't know. Could be."<br><br>"Let's go over there and see." And before Dimitri could howl in protest, Ivan gingerly stood up and stepped onto the next car, clutching his furry friend close to him.

He frowned and spun slowly in his seat to face the counter. He leaned both elbows on the table. "<i>Che cazzo stai dicendo</i>?" he muttered. "Yes--" he cut in again almost immediately. "Yes I'd say, though, what I'm actually asking is how in God's name you could have incited him to do this." Then he listened in silence for a very long while. "Obviously he was trying to have a laugh at you both," he observed eventually. "You might have checked the... All right. Yes, fine, that's <i>fair</i>, Ces. I understand. Let me ask you again not to shout. How's the foot?" He winced. "I'll see what I can do. Tell me where he went." A pause. "It's unbelievably clear who I'm talking about. Don't be dense, now, please. We'll worry about the other one ourselves." He nodded along with the response. "Understood. Well. Let Nico know. I'll work on things from this end and get back to you shortly. Also consider declaring yourself a monk and spending the rest of this trip in reverent isolation." Massimo closed the phone and looked down the counter to the bartender.<br><br>"Excuse me," he said. "Did I miss you? I'm very sorry. I'd like to discuss a couple of things. First, how much do I owe you for the drink my brother skipped out on; and second, is there a security unit aboard the train that might be equipped to deal with the lunatic who just stabbed this brother in the foot and is now moving forward from the caboose?"<br><br>* * *<br><br>"What an unexpected pleasure," Higgledy-Piggledy commented.<br><br>Rhometer at first thought he was maybe talking about some cool bird that had just flown by or maybe a cloud in a delicious-looking shape but then he figured it out. There was a woman walking toward them on the roof of the train. And Rhometer recognized her! It was Miss Bubble! No! Uh. It was -- Miss Rubble! Hmm. Closer. He squinted in thought. He had it. It was Miss Rustle. The one <i>with</i> the bubbles. <i>That</i> was what had confused him. <i>Totally</i>. Bubbles.<br><br>"Bubbles," he added thoughtfully.<br><br>"Bubbles apparently beyond your power to destroy which sets them in a rare and coveted position among all the things in the world."<br><br>"I know," said Rho. He grinned resolutely. "I have meeted my <i>mash</i>. Hi Miss Rustle! Hi her friend!!"<br><br>* * *<br><br>Whether Nico would have tolerated or rejected being assigned another mission from Cesare when he was already making excellent progress on the first will remain a question unanswered, at least for the moment. He would have received a phone call around now from the bleeding and furious middle Giarrettiera informing him of two wrongdoers, a dickwad in a white cloak and a dickwad with a sword. Nico was in fact too busy flinching violently in response to the light-haired woman's movements to notice the incoming call.</div></div>

The smell itself is enough to make me gain some pounds.” Telrien smoothed the front of her dress accusingly then shrugged. Casually, she reached into her one of her bag's pockets and picked out two or three light blue, bead like balls and made her way over to the food. Happily she found that there was quite the selection of sea food which she piled a good portion of her plate with along with a few things she'd never seen before. Once she was through the line she faced the problem it seemed many folks were having. Nowhere to sit. Telrien glanced at the floor as if in debate, but then decided against it as one of the many richly dressed people dropped their own bounty onto it. <br><br>“Not in this dress...” She mumbled. As she continued to look for a usable seat she noticed that some of the benched at the bar weren't taken and whether it was for looks or some other reason a few were not attached to the floor, but just placed in divots to keep them from moving around as much during the flight. <br><br><i> “Maybe they're in the middle of upgrading or something.” </i> she thought as she strode over to the bar. Putting her dish down on the counter she addressed the tender there.<br><br>“I'm just going to borrow this for a few ok? I promise I'll bring it back.” she said smiling sweetly. Without waiting for an answer she  picked up the bench in one hand and her food in the other and made her way to an “empty” stop in the room were she promptly sat on her bench and used her lap as a table. Sure she could have stayed at the bar, but the smell/taste of alcohol wasn't exactly in the top ten list of her sense's pallet. Though she had to admit that alcohol was one of the things that had made her as good at her profession as she was. Telrien's thoughts wandered back into the past as she ate her meal.<br><br>Thirteen years before...<br><br>Telrien slipped out of her room through the window as stealthily as she could manage. It was a holiday weekend. Perfect for practice. It was about a mile to the nearest Tilbyr, but that wasn't too far. You could hear the crowd that had gathered together for their good time when you got close and all she had to do was hide in the shadows and wait by the door. It would be like an assembly line. If she was discrete enough she would get more than her allowance ever added up to. <br><br>She'd learned the few beginning ticks off of one of the visiting fishermen when she had tried to take one of his fish. The plan had been to show her father that she'd caught something, but needless to say she was caught that time. He had been a nice man, she decided. I bit questionable, but nice. He taught her her game after all.<br><br><br>Amused by the memory, Telrien got up from her bench and strode back to the bar with it. <br><br>“Thanks for that.” she said, leaving her plate on the counter and moving on to the next car.<br><br>“It's much better to not work on an empty stomach.” Glancing into her hand she eyed the ten dollar bill resting there. <br><br>“Hmm, the tips aren't that bad here either.”</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">OOC: Decided just to post my stuff for George. Expect Zebedee/Thyra, Helen, and yes, NOPCSA in my next post here.<br>BIC: “Did I actually ask you about going out with me?” George turned to Rie, lowering his shades just far enough to reveal icy blue eyes.<br><br>“It’s a juvenile notion that a lot of men possess. To enjoy something, you have to own it. You have to make it your own, mark your territory,” George turned back to the bar, his drink having been set down on the counter. With a dismissive gesture, crushed the oxygen out of the air around his glass, strangling the flame. It died down to a wisp and then faded away.<br><br>“They don’t think ‘Maybe I can enjoy this without buying it, without forcing it into captivity,’”  George downed his shot with a single gulp, “That’s the sign of a real entrepreneur, of a real somebody. They don’t come with a preconceived notion of boundaries, of what they can and can’t do. They write their own rules, and write over the rules of the smallminded peons that try to hem them in. They don’t ask, they don’t stake claims, they just find a way to achieve the means they want.”<br><br>“So, with that all said, don’t think I’m planning on making you some sexual conquest of mine. Sex is cheap, and I really don’t consider it worth getting out of my seat for some pretty little blonde thing that struts by. Good looking women might be uncommon for a typical person, but they’re like water in a rainstorm for anybody of actual influence. If the powerful simply take a step into the outside world, they’ll find themselves buried in them.”<br><br>“Now power… That is not cheap, that is not common. When you really look at the world, put it in the palm of your hand…” George extended a hand, resting his elbow on the bar. A perfect replication of the planet Earth turned in the air above it, a flawless illusion. He turned to face Rie again, “Really, really look at it, you see that right and wrong aren’t actually set in stone. They’re words that get ascribed meanings by the people that hold power. If morality itself is simply a toy for the mighty, what does that say about every lesser aspect of human nature?”<br><br>“It’s a very interesting idea, my stoic companion, that enough sway over the people around you allows you to make reality itself bend to your will. Maybe not to say ‘down is now up’, and have them all fall into space, but-“ George tensed his fingertips, and a large fissure tore across the phantom globe. The crevasse expanded until it bisected the planet, leaving it to rip itself into luminous chunks of molten rock, “You can convince every one of the chumps out there that they will.”<br><br>He lifted his hand from the bar, and held it out towards Rie, as if expecting a handshake. The illusion faded away, leaving only a few dying green sparks resting on the wood.<br><br>“Now, do you think that might be something interesting? Overturning and upsetting the paradigms humanity uses to blind themselves to reality, and…” George’s free hand patted the stack of bills on the table, “Coming out richer than most minds could even comprehend in the process.”</div></div>

With that, he tore away and discarded the jumpsuit. Underneath, he was wearing only a leopard print thong and a bow tie.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Helen nodded, her hat dipping slightly.<br><br>“I suppose that you’d be right. I’ve probably only got an hour or so,” She glanced towards one of the ubiquitous clocks. It had been about six and a half hours since the train had gotten underway, maybe a bit more. She couldn’t recall if they’d left at one or noon.<br><br>“No, not that, even.”<br><br>Despite the lack of time, Helen remained serene. She strode up to Nagisa, and offered her a handshake.<br><br>“It was great to meet you, Ms. Davarin. If you could make it to my performance, I’d be most delighted,” She turned, and started to walk away, “Masquerade, if you’re not too preoccupied, I’d also be glad to have you there.”<br><br>She slid the door open, and exited the car.<br>-------<br>Rhometer responded to Thyra’s call after babbling to himself (for what felt like a lot longer than it really was).<br><br>“H- Ah, hey, Rhometer. My name’s Zebedee, and I’m Miss- Thyra- I’m Thyra’s friend,” Zebedee glanced down towards the roof of the train. The boy’s shadow was certainly not moving in a natural way, moving with a grace that seemed to counterpoint the erratic, boneless, jellyfish-wiggle that the youth seemed to dart around with. <br><br>His racquet caught another gleam of the reddish sunlight. The warrior stepped forward and offered his hand to Rhometer. The boy seemingly looked towards it (though that distinction was hard to make, since it seemed his pupils were doing laps in opposite directions).<br><br>“You seem like an interesting guy, Rho’.”<br><br>Thyra turned, feeling a few footsteps on the rooftop behind her. Though the vibrations were subtle, it certainly broke from the steady rumble of the train beneath their feet.<br><br>It took her a moment, even in spite of her typical knack for names and faces.<br><br>“Ivan! It’s been far too many years!” She smiled faintly, taking a half-step towards him. She preferred not to let Rhometer get too far out of sight, lest Zebedee be revised into a zebra, or the youth decided that it would be fun to take the train for an underwater joyride.<br><br>She spotted a tiny black nose, peering out of Ivan’s garb.<br><br>“And Dimitri as well! I’m delighted, truly,” Thyra shuffled another portion of a pace, being mindful of the intense winds.<br><br>“It’s been… Well, it has not been forever since I’ve seen either of you, but I’d venture a guess that we’re on the far side of half a decade,” She cast a glance back over her shoulder.<br><br>Zebedee was drawing animals in the air with dancing lights, clearly trying to entertain his new acquaintance. He’d already shaped a tiger out of luminous green, and a long-nosed anteater out of shimmering teal. The two shapes were spinning about Rhometer’s head like a mobile, seemingly keeping his attention for the moment.<br><br>That would be enough for now, she supposed. She gracefully lowered herself to a seated position atop the car, and patted a spot next to her.<br><br>“So, I’m afraid I don’t know what you two have been through in the past couple years. It would be most wonderful if you could enlighten me as to what’s happened in the interim.”<br>-------<br>Nopcsa braced the door shut behind him, and glanced back again. He’d managed to set up a few detours and obstacles along the way, but Prime had simply sliced, diced, and bulled his way through all of them. He wasn’t faring much better than any of the makeshift deterrents, a large shallow cut across his left shoulder bleeding slowly into his uniform, and a collection of bruises about his shoulders and neck throbbing a steady bass to accompany his thoughts.<br><br>Auguste had certainly sold the swordsman short, when asked about how much power their mark had gained since they’d first met. Probably for a good reason… Nopcsa bit his lip. The scars on his cheek were tingling.<br><br>No, no, no. He’d fucked up the job in Salt Lake City. They came out okay in the end, but the only reason that situation degenerated as far as it did was because he hadn’t put his foot down. That had cost him Auguste’s favor, his preferential treatment on assignments… And his “friendship” with Terrian.<br><br>That sort of thing would not happen again today.<br><br>Nopcsa drew a steakknife he’d purloined from one of the diners when Prime chokeslammed him through the table. That’d work well enough. After opening the door to the car ahead of him, he slammed the utensil into the covering between the cars.<br><br>The fabric tore with a loud whoosh, the knife getting jerked out by the air ripping past. It gouged the mindreader’s palm as it went, leaving him with a bloody nick. More scars to regale the grandchildren with eventually.<br><br>Nopcsa spun through the open door, pulling his cape tightly behind him. An instant later, the doors to the area between the cars automatically closed and locked. A small red sign above the exit lit up, informing the passengers that the passageway was out of order until maintenance crews arrived.<br><br>That would actually buy him a bit of time.<br><br><i>Now, who here looks loaded and lost…</i> A familiar female voice caught his attention. Nopcsa spotted a graceful figure trying to merge with the crowd, feigning disappointment at the technical difficulties while slowly slipping wallets and jewelry free with a subtlety that was all but invisible.<br><br>Telrien. Good. She’d be able to help him carry out the mission. In fact, he’d planned on her being there. She’d been the “Emergency Backup”, in case things with Prime had gone… Well, about as well as could be expected, really. Going by what had happened the night he’d met Terrian, and the events of the day so far, Prime apparently ripped through plans and conspiracies like most people chawed on beef jerky.<br><br>Nopcsa allowed himself a small grin, and quickly began walking towards Telrien.<br><br>“Everybody, everybody, please calm down. The reports of a berserk burglar in the back cars of the train are indeed true, but we’ve sealed the doorway to prevent him from getting through while security deals with him. Still, we’d advise you to make your way towards the front of the train, as we’re not liable for any possessions stolen, emotional trauma incurred, or limbs lost while this man is on his bloody rampage.”<br><br>That took care of the crowd. They began moving towards the next car up, forming a steady press of bodies. Easy, easy hunting ground for his partner.<br><br>Speaking of which, he needed to actually rendezvous with her to carry out the next step in the plan. He pushed towards her, between an elderly couple, around a very rotund man, and over a trio of children. He nodded to her, and started to mouth the codewords-<br><br>WHAM! Something grabbed him by his arm, and wrenched him to the floor. The grip maintained its pressure, sliding along until it felt like it was crushing his fingers.<br><br>Nopcsa found himself looking up at the mustachioed face of Orville Giguere, the heir glowering down at him like a particularly smug heavenly body.<br><br>“Don’t be deceived, ladies and gentlemen. This man here is an accomplice to the other thief, merely trying to fleece us while the other one causes a commotion.”<br><br>Nopcsa glanced around, the back of his head throbbing enough to pulsate his vision. Telrien was nowhere to be seen, evidently having decided she’d be better off plucking what goodies there were for the taking than assisting him.<br><br>“Piss off, Puff. Or you’ll no longer be playing along Cherry Lane,” Nopcsa swung at Giguere’s groin with his elbow, missing by the sparest of margins.<br><br>“You never could read me, Nopcsa, am I right?” Giguere released his grip on the mindreader’s hand, and kicked him in the shoulder. The young man gasped in pain, clutching at his prior wound.<br><br>“I’d figured as much. And soon, soon enough,” He knelt nearer, and muttered so that the straggling passengers wouldn’t hear him, “Soon enough, Prime’ll be here. And we’ll split whatever money the Order gives us for your safe return…”<br><br>Nopcsa saw the Out-of-Order sign shut off. Somebody had already patched the gap, apparently, and Prime would be free to enter.<br><br>“Or, my personally preference…” Giguere’s pointed tongue ran along his lips, and ruffled his mustache, “We could just split <i>you</i>.”<br>OOC: Eh, all three weren't that great, but it moves us along.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">The crowd began to bristle with the beginnings of a panic, having been informed of a possible pickpocket in their ranks and at the same time privy to the disarming and abuse of Nopcsa at the hands of Orville. Women grasped at their throats, one trembling hand quickly searching for the anniversary pearls and Tiffany earrings while the other clutched viselike around designer purses and exotic handbags. Men instinctively slapped their rear pockets seeking the familiar lump of fat leather tucked within while simultaneously rustling inside jacket and breast pockets for hand watches and other treasures. A collective wail rose from the throng as a sense of desperate urgency took hold and moved the passengers violently towards the forward compartments, away from the madness unfolding behind them. <br><br>As dozens of hands scrambled at the door mechanism, it suddenly opened of its own accord, and from behind it a piercing whistle shattered the air, so shrill and loud that it drew a cry of astonished pain from the panicked passengers before rendering the whole of the traincar silent as a tomb. Wally Creed removed his fingers from his wrinkled lips and stepped inside, parting the crowd on authority alone. <br><br>'Does someone,' Creed hissed, his graying eyes smoldering with a fury ripened over many years of life, '<i>ANYONE</i> want to tell me just what in the blue <i>fuck</i> is going on in here?!' He leveled a bitter stare at Orville, still crouched over the whimpering Nopcsa. Footsteps stampeded in from the forward compartment as uniformed King Thomas staffers rushed in and fanned out around Wally. A stifled gasp shot from the frightened passengers as their eyes fell on the stun batons in each trainman's hand. <br><br>'I've got reports coming from every car past Eight that say all Hell's broken loose back here!' The conductor stabbed a finger at Orville. 'Have you gone completely out of your mind, son?! Do you have any idea what kind of trouble you're in?!' He shot a cursory glance at the prostrated Nopcsa, 'And you- you are definitely up Shit Creek.' Creed stepped forward. Whatever jovial demeanor the old man had once possessed was long gone now. <br><br>'I run a tight ship. My tolerance for horseshit like this is <i>nonexistent</i>. You two are under arrest.

Giving a parting sort of nod towards Masquerade as she left, Nagisa then turned and left herself - walking casually down the hall. Several minutes later of searching and still not finding where her room could be, she could sense there was some kind of commotion going on somewhere aboard the train. Though a part of her curiously wished to see what was going on, she didn't want to get involved in whatever mess it was.

A flicker of brighter red than the maroon, orange and brown leaves of the apple tree had caught her eye. A cardinal had perched on one of the highest branches. The girl waved, but didn't get the bird's attention. It was young maybe, the bird, still small and squat. The girl stared at it for another moment before a stronger gust came though.

She didn't feel as though either of those words could be that helpful anyway. "Materialized" was way better. "Drivel" gave her a little more pause -- she wanted to think it had something to do with driving -- but that didn't make any sense. She reached out for the dictionary. Then she decided she didn't need it. She could tell what it meant really. Bad stuff. Worthless stuff. The rest of it was easy except she didn't know what "MS" stood for. Oh well. It probably wouldn't be very useful either. Neither would "drivel". This was all drivel honestly, except "materialized" -- "materialized" was good. She said it again without the "-d".

Sarosin blinked at his associate. His expression was one that would easily be bemused if he'd had any idea what had just happened or what the appropriate response might be. He wasn't sure the others in the bar were any less lost than he. <br><br>Deciding that there wasn't anything much else to say, Sarosin repeated, "Well." <br><br>He was beginning to feel very uneasy. Sarosin would never go so far as to say that he might have <i>powers</i> or any bogus junk like that. But he had déjà vu, and he had hunches, crazy hunches, and he had these frequently; it hadn't taken him long to figure out that the more closely he followed these – well, not premonitions – the better off he was. <br><br>And at this moment in time, he was beginning to get some very urgent hunches regarding the stoic man who had recently arrived at the bar. <br><br>(For the life of him, he couldn't put his finger on this guy. His demeanor was so much like...well, similar, anyway, but decidedly not the right man...Maybe it was something in his face? His nose or jawline or eyes or something. So familiar.)<br><br>There were two exits to the car: one, nearest to the psychotic whiskey-drinking girl, with whom he did not particularly feel like trifling; and the one through which he'd entered the bar. Decidedly the safer of the two exits, the latter was nevertheless blocked (well, not <i>physically</i>) by the quiet type he had so fervently decided to get away from. <br><br>Regardless of the vibes, though, the man really had no reason to waylay him. There was no reason he couldn't just sort of edge by—<br><br>"'Scuse me, gentlemen," Sarosin announced, setting his glass down behind him with parting finality. "Yoshimitsu."

After we and Hector severed ties, we went on a trip around the world. Had to stop at Argentina though, I caught some nasty bug while I was there and then we lost all of our camping gear, completely broke with no other place to stay."<br><br>"I'm not kidding when I say this guy is absolutely meshugenah. Travel, travel, travel! It's all he thinks about! I can't get any rest whatsoever. It's always 'Let's hike up this mountain' or 'Let's go see this festival in this city all the way over there.' I mean, it's fun, but I wish he'd take a break." Dimitri yawned, stretched, and reclined inside the snug nook created by Ivan's crossed arms. "Plus, he can't let me eat in peace."<br><br>"Dimitri, you always complain so much, but you stick with me anyway. You have fun traveling with me and you know it."<br><br>"I know, but I still think we should take breaks in between. If you keep wandering around like this you'll wear your feet down to bloody stumps. Maybe rent a nice summer cottage in the country somewhere."<br><br>"Maybe if we weren't so broke, but sometimes I think you're on to something. Maybe we'll go stay with Hector and the Summoners for a couple months, how does that sound?"<br><br>"Ugh, of all the people you could have picked, why Hector."<br><br>"Because I hear he could use a good friend these days. Poor guy's not doing so well, I hear he's been having trouble with his wife."<br><br>"That's because he sleeps with everything that moves!"<br><br>"Dimitri, what kind of brother are you? I think we should drop by and say hi. Maybe go camping with him somewhere new and exotic."<br><br>Dimitri whined.<br><br>"At least <i>Hector</i> enjoys traveling with me."

A nudnik?<br><br>"Yes, Ivan, you're a complete nudnik sometimes. That's what my father would have said."<br><br>"Your distinctively Yiddish diction always amuses me."<br><br>"Your distinctively insufferable crazy amuses me too."<br><br>Ivan smiled. Dimitri could complain all he wanted about weary legs and empty stomachs, but inside he knew that he and Ivan were inseparable.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">From behind the protective stance of his arms, both elbows on the table and hand cupped over fist, Nico's face arose. He rested his chin on one thumb, his lips on one knuckle, and considered letting the man in the trenchcoat go. He did not owe his older brother any favors; in fact, to Nico's knowledge, it was Cesare who was currently in debt to <i>him</i>, and Nico would so hate to inconvenience his brother by skewing the accounts even further in his own favor. Meanwhile, though, the indelible fact remained that a Giarrettiera had, at least apparently, been robbed.<br><br>To say this would not do wasn't quite putting it in enough detail. This would be undone. Nullified. Stricken from the record.<br><br>There was simply not a man capable of getting the better of the Giarrettieras, not like this. By plotting, by calculation, by preparation, yes, perhaps some temporary victory could be scored; Nico had no reason to pretend to himself no enemy had ever thwarted their family in such a way. But not this crude animal act of larceny, this simple movement of the hand. There was no man who could profit off the Giarrettieras with such a gesture. And if he dared flatter himself that he'd managed it, such a man thought so only because he could not yet apprehend the full picture and his imminent correction.<br><br>Nico uncupped his hand to adjust his glasses. Then he patted his pocket. Next he stood up and followed the other man out of the room.<br><br>He certainly hoped this was the correct target, as Nico had already experienced one conversation awkward enough to tide him over for another few hours. Steeling his resolve was the fact that so far he had not seen any other dickwads in trenchcoats aboard the <i>King Thomas</i>.<br><br>* * *<br><br>The trenchcoat flapped around Rhometer's form in a way that was not necessarily obeisant to the direction of the bracing wind. He clapped his hands as the green tiger and the teal anteater chased each other around his head. "That's's really cool!" he told the racket man Zebedee. "How you maked that those! I can make stuff too. Did I -- <i>Oh.</i>" The very thought of telling Zebedee this was making him grin too hard to talk. Higgledy Piggledy sighed and Rhometer ignored him. <br><br>"<i>Did I tell you I maked this train?</i>" He nodded ferociously for evidence. "THE HOLE TRAIN. From the um the <i>front part</i> all the way to--"<br><br>* * *<br><br>"The caboose, I'm assuming, or the next car up from it," Massimo said. "I'm sure if the doctor can't find him right away, they'll at least notice some blood to follow. My brother seems to like trailing it around melodramatically at times like this!" He stood up, achieving less height than when he'd sat on the stool. "It's good to know there's a medical unit aboard. Though perhaps treating a stabbed foot would be beneath them? I can only imagine they'd have prepared for the train to crash into an aircraft..."</div></div>

It was an ordinary fabric trench coat, colored a deep tan. He couldn't exactly complain that it didn't match his attire, as he thought himself lucky to find one at all.<br><br>But he hated tan, with passion. Tree or people colored coats were just, odd. But, though with some hesitation, he pulled it on. And continued his search. The coat covered his weapons fairly well, and he was aware that he must be causing a commotion by now. He certainly hasn't expected Nopcsa to lead him such a merry chase, though he'd prefer the man be significantly less merry when he caught up with him.<br><br>He was not finding the sexual tension associated with his attempts to kill him, even REMOTELY comfortable.

After all, money is merely a stepping stone to greater things, my future friend,” George smiled, the glow of flames seemingly reflecting on his teeth, even though he’d downed his drink long ago.<br><br>“We’ll be in touch,” George’s body slowly went hazy, and then started to become translucent. Soon, his skeleton was showing through, and then even that went invisible.<br><br>Laying on the bar, beneath the stack of bills, was a single business card with a number embossed on it in gold, bedecked with a piece of obsidian and a ruby in the center. It smelled faintly of smoke.<br><br>-------<br>“Well, I didn’t really make those. I just borrowed some light from the other side of the planet, where the sun’s gone up already, and then shined it… Shone it? Shown it in some fancy shapes.

Rhometer was stretching his arms (unnaturally) far apart, unable to quite vocalize exactly HOW made he’d made the train (at this point, he seemed to be indicating that he’d actually also made a few invisible cars beyond the caboose for good measure).<br><br>“You did? Reallyyy?” Zebedee put his hands on his knees, his racquet hovering alongside him like a patient hummingbird, “That’s really great, Rhometer!

The anteater’s nose and tailed began stretching out, as if it were taffy being pulled from both ends. It snagged the tiger around the tail, provoking the neon beast into lashing back at it. Soon, the two animals were tangled into a wreath of iridescent colors, forming a floating laurel.<br><br>“I can’t say I’ve ever really made anything that cool. I once made all the shore in Whelkshore into glass, if you’re ever by there, but it’s nowhere near as neat as a flying train.”<br><br>Thyra thought she heard the Summoners mentioned. So, Hector still was in the belly of the beast. Such was life.<br><br>“Traveling all the time does bear a certain degree of romance,” Thyra said softly, her voice lost in the wind but for the sharp ears of her companions.<br><br>“To ever take root is to be realistic, to admit that you need the certainty of everyday life and the creature comforts inherent to such a thing,” Thyra’s smile drifted away, as if the smoke from the engine had bore it into the distance.<br><br>“I’m on the exact opposite end of things, I’m afraid. Bar a few trips to Burkina Faso, and weekly visits to Whelkshore, I still am anchored to Slateport. I’ve lived there my whole life, and indeed, now longer than anybody else who resides there.”<br><br>“Of course, it’s arguable that at this point, it’s not the city that sustains me, but my efforts that sustain it. Not that I really want to own up to such a thing, as it really does sound awfully self-important. Sly’s done his part too, as have all of the different contractors and volunteers that we’ve brought in. You know what? Disregard my statement about sustaining it.”<br><br>Thyra saw the lights go on in the car behind them, gleaming off the ocean’s choppy surface.<br><br>“I simply happened upon a wording that struck me as too clever not to use.”<br>--------<br>“So, we’re in some predicament involving poop, right?” Nopcsa couldn’t help but smile, even as Giguere continued wrenching his arm, “I think you’ve got me confused with the kid who’s putting cherrybombs down the toilets. Me? I’m only dealing with inciting a panic and all in all, making this cruise that much more entertaining than the shuffleboard and fruity drinks you guys had lined up for it.”<br><br>“Yes. You can keep badmouthing our captor, Nopcsa. See where it gets you. I suppose that this situation arose in the first place because you couldn’t muster the sophistication necessary to obey those of greater station,” Giguere offered his hands to one of the men placidly, the cuffs snapping onto his wrists securely.<br><br>“Oh, c’mon, Gigi. The only station this fellow has over us is the train station,” Nopcsa groaned as he staggered to his feet, “He’s just venting about how impotent modern infrastructure makes him feel. I mean, I bet he saw the Wright brothers, and was all like ‘What the crap is that?’ Man, when the segway went on the market, I bet he had to drag himself out of the nursing home just to make sure people remembered what a locomotive <i>was</i>.” <br><br>Two of the guards stepped in on either side of Nopcsa, taking hold of his upper arms while securing the handcuffs on him.<br><br>“So, Mr. Creed, what do you have planned for your next work of art? The orbital horse buggy? The cold-fusion driven rickshaw? A pair of sandals invoking quantum physics? Of course, all run with the proper degree of hardassed discipline, as befitting such dignified creations,” Nopcsa fell silent as Prime exploded into the room. This would either be exactly the distraction he needed, or it’d end up dooming them all to a few weeks in the “brig”.<br><br>And then Prime grinned.

Prime is also standing beside the only exit with a set of extremely deadly weapons, additionally the only weapons in the room that could cut through the thin alluminum doors generally found on passanger trains. So, pretty much, as long as he doesn't cause to much chaos, he can keep track of Nopcsa through the authorities and do whatever he needs to do to get at him.<br><br>Sneaking into the 'brig' in this case, would be a good fit. So, instead of carving up the room to get at Nopcsa, he's more likely just to slip aside and escape. Especially since these guards haven't actually done anything to warrant him killing them, hell, their weapons are non-lethal even. They'd just hurt like shit. <br><br>So yeah, main mode here, escape and keep track of Nopcsa in order to wreak shadowy havoc on the mans life later on.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Illiana was still trying to figure out the train as she made her way, what she figured was, to the back. There had to be some magical element that was keeping it aloft, but she couldn't find source nor symptom. If it wasn't for the view out the windows, she wouldn't have been able to tell it was flying, or even moving at all. There was no chugga-chugga rattling like a normal train, no swaying and shaking as it followed its tracks.<br><br>She wasn't dressed like most passengers on the train. She didn't actually own a dress, so she felt quite put out when shuffling through the carriages. Instead of the somewhat formal attire that everyone else was wearing, she'd opted for a simple jeans-and-t-shirt outfit that she'd been hoping wouldn't attract too much attention. To hide her hair, she'd opted for a black bandana that shielded most of it. A few strands had come loose but if questioned, she'd say it was dyed that colour. No need to invite hostilities on a friendly trip.<br><br>"Maybe somewhere near the rear..." She mumbled to herself, casually slipping past a couple conversing about something or other. She thought she heard a snippet about one man converting his second floor of his mansion into a gym. Why someone would do that was beyond her, though maybe money-induced madness was to blame. She rolled her eyes, continuing through the carriage. She had to be near the end of the train now.<br><br>"Oh."<br><br>When she stepped into the next carriage, she was greeted by the sight of a rather burly man bleeding profusely from his foot. Not exactly what she was expecting to see on a 'peaceful trip'. But of course, Illiana was Illiana, and she acted first before thinking of the possible consequences.

Bert and Lacy wouldn't care too much about his appearance, but he didn't enjoy looking or feeling like a slob. He then opened the sliding door and stepped out of the room and collided with two small children. <br><br>"Hey, sorry about that, are you two ok?" asked Arnold, who was only slightly concerned.<br><br>"Yes. I am sorry about that, we should have been more careful." replied one of them calmly. The other looked slightly startled, but didn't say anything. <br><br>"You wouldn't happen to know which way the dining car is, would you? I need to meet up with some friends of mine there."<br><br>"Yes," replied the boy replied again as he stood up. "it is... actually how about we escort you there?

The other boy stood up and smiled at Arnold.<br><br>"Yeah, actually I'd really appreciate it."<br><br>The first boy turned around and walked towards the end of the car, his brother following closely behind. Arnold paused for a moment to straighten his suit before following them to the end of the current car. <br><br>"There are a couple more cars like this one." the one boy said as he led them towards the next car. "They just contain passenger rooms and storage closets. The dining car was quite full when I was last there, you may have difficulty finding your friends." He then led them into another passenger car.<br><br>"And of course some people seem to be somewhat rowdy. Doubtlessly they've been drinking, don't you think so, brother?" He asked, his voice making it difficult for Arnold to tell whether or not the boy actually cared. The boy looked over his shoulder at his brother and Arnold. His brother nodded to him before turning to look at Arnold, a look of exasperation filled his face.<br><br>"My name is Aaron, Aaron Enderson. By brother's name is Wilber. If I may, what is your name?"<br><br>"Just call me Arnold." <br><br>"Well, Arnold, good luck finding your friends in here."

WOM WOM WOMMMMMMM</i></div><br><br>A trail of blood led from the door to the caboose up the corridor, where Cesare'd given up on trying to make it into one of the unoccupied cabins and had just slumped against the wall, breathing raggedly through clenched teeth. His whole face was pounding and that huge goddamned nose was spurting blood like a faucet. One thick-fingered hand was holding the cell up to his ear, while the other one furiously pulled and twisted the folds of the pant leg going down to the stabbed foot -- The fucking <i>foot</i> -- Cesare glared back down at it with eyes almost shut (if he'd had a mirror, he'd've seen that the whole upper half of his face'd basically turned into wrinkles). The dark-red-splattered shoe lurched and kicked against his efforts to keep still. The cocksucker had gone through <i>bone</i>. Felt like his foot was fucking falling apart. He squeezed his watering eyes shut and shouted at the ceiling:<br><br>"Pig ub the phode, you <i>modderfugger!</i>"<br><br>Nico did not pick up the phone.<br><br>Cesare slammed it onto the ground and roughly drew his sleeve across his face, wiping off some of the blood. He could taste it in his mouth and wanted to spit, but stopped when he realized the thought fucking disgusted him. He didn't understand that until he remembered the cocksucker spitting onto the floor back near the caboose. He swallowed the blood and winced. Then he bashed his head back against the wall for a few times, looking for a fresh source of pain. Didn't help. Cesare howled something incoherent about ripping the man apart with his bare hands probably.<br><br>The door at this end of the car slid open. <br><br>Some broad in street clothes and a black bandanna was standing there. Great. Kickass. Sooner someone put him on a stretcher and set him up at whatever shit little infirmary must have been tucked away somewhere on this train, the better. He scowled up at her through the tears, panting, waiting for her to scream and run away to go tell the authorities.<br><br>Thing was, though, she didn't scream. Matter of fact, after only a faint gasp, she frowned thoughtfully and kneeled down next to him. He blinked.<br><br>"Hold on a second."<br><br>"Whad're you...? Hey--!"<br><br>Cesare was not cool with her reaching out toward the stabbed foot, but whatever he'd thought she was about to do with it, he wasn't expecting her to hold her hands a few inches over the foot without even touching it. He jerked the foot back sharply in alarm as, through the holes in the shoe and sock, he saw his wound glow white. And then it disappeared. The skin showed pale but smooth through the holes. The pain was totally gone. Eyes wide, Cesare wiggled his toes as well as he could inside the stiff shoe. "Hody shid..."<br><br>The woman stood up. "How's that feel?" she asked. "It might tingle for a few hours."<br><br>"Id feels <i>graid!</i>" he said, pushing himself up off the floor. He took a step forward and straight away almost collapsed against the wall again. The foot gave under pressure. It was numb and limp. All the same, it was intact. He waggled his shoe around a little in the air with a grin. "Jesus! Thang you..."<br><br>Then he remembered who he was thanking. <br><br>He trailed off and sniffled without thinking. The nose was still leaking. Probably broken. Maybe light enough that he could just knock back some aspirin and give it an ice pack for the rest of the day, but if it was actually fucked up -- <br><br>The caster was staring at him.<br><br>Cesare sniffled again and then let out a huff. Then he gestured vaguely toward his nose and said, "You don' thig you cud--?"</div></div>

Then he groped it with a few fingers. Totally fixed. Wasn't even bleeding anymore. He sniffed.

Long as he had it back by dinner.<br><br>"You really wanna know?" he asked the caster. She nodded. He grunted and slid back down onto the floor. Numb leg was having some trouble keeping him up.

Once he was satisfied there was a difference, he went on. "But then while I've got ahold of him, I got a look in the caboose. Nothing. Some people who looked pretty spooked, but no one dead. And before I can figure out what just happened... well..."<br><br>He gestured to his shoe.<br><br>"Guess that's what I get for tryin' to be a hero, huh," he sighed. "Next time I'm staying out of it.

This should allow for someone involved in that car to help me get pulled into a tale.</div><br><br><i>Still nervous of what strange presence it was that Raijuu could sense in the train, Nagisa cautiously plodded forward through the car in more earnest search for her room... trying best to act normal in case of bumping into anyone. No way in hell she'd be able to fully explain herself if she looked paranoid or freaked. But the further she got in the car, the more she felt like someone was right smack dab behind her. The fear of the unknown was disturbing her to the core, causing her dragonic heart to pound intensely within her like a great war drum. And just when she was about to reach the handle of the door to the next car, Nagisa couldn't take the suspense any longer and quickly whirled around - half expecting to see whatever grim specter was beguiling her. <br><br>To her amazement as well as tremendous relief, she saw nothing at all. Simply the empty corridor she'd walked down. Though, being so empty did seem suspiciously unnerving. Giving a loud sigh as she faced the door once more, Nagisa turned the handle and ventured into the next car. KABAM! She accidently walked straight into someone else who'd been hurriedly heading for the door that she'd just opened - sending the both of them backwards onto the floor. Nagisa slightly felt like she'd gotten the wind knocked out of her from the blow, and before she could say anything in apology to the stranger, he had already taken off like a lightning bolt through the door. Several people in the corridor who had witnessed the event were now crowding around asking questions and gently helping her to her feet. Feeling a twinge in her left side whenever she breathed in (which also made her wince a little), and though she knew she should have that looked at, Nagisa turned down a passenger's offer to go find the medics. To her utter joy, upon telling the concerned man her name, she was informed that a room in this car had been reserved for a "Ms. Davarrin". The kindly fellow then showed Nagisa the way to the room he spoke of, which turned out to be right near the entrance to the dining car and was indeed her room, with her bits of luggage neatly set out on the bed. So very thankful to be in her room at long last, she decided to plop herself down in the middle of the bed for a few minutes before she'd change and go find something to eat in the next car.<br><br>A short while later, after she'd thoroughly enjoyed the comfiness of her squishy bed, Nagisa had put on one of her most beautiful dresses - an elegant Chinese-style dark blue gown with short sleeves and decorated with silver trim and white dragons. Not a traditional Drakyan outfit like the green one she'd worn earlier, but lovely nonetheless. As she prepared to leave and go check out the dining car, Nagisa once more felt that same jab of pain in her side when she took a deep breath. This time it really worried her, because it felt almost as if it was in her heart. What the hell was it? Stepping out of the room and as she made her way to the dining car, she telepathicly discussed her concern with Raijuu...</i><br><br>"Something is causing a sharp pain in my chest sometimes when I breathe in. At first, it felt as if it was my lung, but now it feels as though it's my heart. Noble Raijuu, is there any way that you could somehow peer inside of me and see what's doing that? I'm a bit scared..."<br><br>Raijuu: [[If there truly was something wrong, don't you think the Phoenix Ruby would glow bright indigo to alert you to danger? Remember that it can do that, should your life be threatened enough. But since you're so worried, I shall gladly take a look at your heart and lung to see if there is possibly something the pendant cannot sense. Not now, though. Wait and see if there is a good place inside the dining car for you to take refuge and relax. It'll take me several minutes to thoroughly examine you, and it's best if you're not walking around during that time.]]</div></div>

Of course she'd be asked about it when official medics came along and, knowing how this scene was supposed to play out, she'd be questioned at the very least and arrested at worst. She considered lying, but then she'd have to come up with some excuse as to why a stabbed foot, which the owner of which had just confessed that it had been stabbed, was suddenly devoid of any kind of marking or injury. <br><br>Oh well. She'd made her bed and now she had to lie in it.<br><br>"Um... yes, it was," she answered uncertainly. She glanced at the door. It'd probably be easy to escape, but she'd have to avoid every official on the train. Still, better than being arrested on the spot. "Is that an issue?"</div></div>

The fear of that pain happening in her chest again made the poor woman not be that careful of seeing where she was walking, and Nagisa kept accidently bumping into folks a little bit and having to apologize. A few minutes later, thinking she'd found a less busy part of the dining car, she looked around in hope of finding the perfect place to sit. Suddenly, to her surprise, she harshly bumped someone's arm (Aaron).</i><br><br>"Ohhh... so sorry. I wasn't being careful enough. Please forgive me, sir."<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><i>Meanwhile, back in another car, the odd Japanese man was making his way through the train from where his private room was located and keeping close watch on the screen of the computerlike device he was wearing on his wrist. It had some sort of high-tech GPS tracker on one side, and on the other was some kind of an EKG monitor. Whatever sort of heart this device was currently monitoring, it was beating powerfully strong and swift. The man flashed an amused and slightly fiendish sort of smile while looking at the EKG scan, and then continued to check the tracker map as he tried to more quickly make his way through the train... eagerly pursuing the target shown as a red dot on the screen...</i></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Luggage rack.<br><br>There was positively no cause for him to be there, but somehow leShea had managed. It would have been lovely to know how he'd gotten there, but that was unlikely to happen. He didn't remember how it had happened. Come to think of it, he didn't remember most of the train ride up 'til now. Or anything since St. Petersburg, for that matter.<br><br>Oh well, that didn't matter; there were more important things to worry about now. Like how to get down.<br><br>Maybe he'd climbed up there for a nap? Similar had happened in Port-au-Prince once, in a bedroom in a seedy brothel. Of course, he hadn't realized it at the time, and neither had the mistress. The moment or revelation had been a groggy one, and punctuated with gratuitous high-pitched shrieks. Could it have been that he snuck on? Trains were an infinite source of entertainment for him, but he didn't often have much money to pay for fare. Or maybe he'd been shoved up there by a bully. He hated bullies, like that old drubmucker who'd given him a new hat and then gotten mad and tried to take it back from him. What a meanie-head!<br><br>Maybe...<br><br>Oh! Someone was walking by beneath him. Pretzeled like he was with his face smushed against the bars, he couldn't make out too many details, but it was definitely a person he saw. Or person-y enough, at least. Definitely not a tarantula or a python. Whoever-it-was seemed more than a bit preoccupied, though. leShea wondered if they'd noticed him. He began to squirm as much as the overhead confinement would let him, and called out.<br><br>"<i>Perdón, excusez-moi, bocsásson meg, oyurushi, a'scuse me please, mo phardún</i>! I'm-a inna tetch o' trouble. C'n ye gimme a han' so I c'n get back daown dere to th' floor?

It was hard to move his fingers, so he crossed his toes inside his heavy boots instead.</div></div>

A few hours past and Flint reemerged, his eyes were completely blue again and his rag doll was strapped to his back.  He quickly walked toward one of the lounge cars.<br> <br>Upon his arrival he looked around and saw a few people ambling around the car but what caught his eye was the young women talking very quietly to a small child. He decided to ignore them for now opting to sit down in one of the nearby window seats.<br> <br>Endless waves can only keep the attention of a mind so long, so Flint decided to talk to someone.

In the next booth over sat a youth no older than 15 if she judged correctly, his expression and tone radiating boredom. She glanced over his appearance. His hair color wasn't exactly normal, but lots of kids colored their hair these days, so it wasn't exactly surprising. Extending her arm across the table she offered a handshake. <br><br><br>“Telrien Wallen is my name. What about you, unge mann? What brings you to this train?” she said politely, slipping into her native tongue at the end. Well, so much for her original plan. If these two were together she doubted that this one would let his little sister go off with her. She didn't see any resemblance, other than the fact that they both didn't look very poor, but that was her business side talking. They were probably too young to have much on them other than a allowance for the arcade or some such.</div></div>

She had enough faith in the world of Powers to not bat her eyelashes at shenanigans.<br><br>The handful of patrons who did not run away screaming, either from fear or curiosity or some strange mixture of the two, from Rie slipping in and out of the train's walls were staring quietly to where the two had been talking.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">One thing bothered Flint while Telrian was introducing herself.  <br><br>"One question who is the little girl you have with you?  You're obviously not related in any way. Maybe your a friend of her family or something?" While Flint asked his question he observed Telrian. She seemed nice enough, but there seemed to be something shady about her. This, of course, only made him want to hang around her more. She might know some violent people. He loved to fight, which is why he wore his gloves. It was one of those things that had gotten him in to trouble over the years. This train was the perfect place to get away from...things for a while. <br></div></div>

You'd think we would be high up enough that insects wouldn't be such an issue!” The man said a little louder than he had intended.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Ohhh, that'd be AWESOME!" The girl declared, clasping her hands in front of her chest. She instantly sprung her feet, whirling to look Telrien in the eye.<br><br>"Miss, you look like you're really good at finding stuff, and really smart. I'm pretty smart too, but this is my first time being on a train, so I'm kinda having a hard time figuring out where to look," The girl grabbed the woman by her hand, practically yanking her off of the seat. <br><br>"Let's go, let's go! I bet we'll find my tutor in <i>minutes</i>!"<br><br>She paused for a moment, letting go of her new acquaintance and fidgeting as the teen introduced himself. While the woman looked reserved and in-control enough, this boy had a sort of disheveled, slacker look to him. It didn't mean he was a bad person, but it was <i>totally</i> the type that she'd always end up in battles with. She regarded him cautiously, making sure to avoid eye contact. She moved towards the bench again, keeping her friend between them.<br><br>"Telrien? That's a really cool sounding name! What does unge mean?" The youth piped up, making a dynamic entry back into the conversation.<br><br>"By the way, my name is Dace! Dace Balao! I'm a Pokemon trainer!" She paused, looking up to see if she got Telrien's approval. For emphasis, she grabbed her small purse from the seat, and slung it over her shoulder. The handbag twirled around her back, and she caught it under her elbow on the opposite side. There was a red and white sphere at either end of the strap, clicked into metal hoops seemingly designed to hold them.<br><br>"I even got on TV once, when I fought Durant. I didn't win it, but everybody said I did really well!" Dace paused for a moment, biting her lip.<br><br>"Well, he wasn't a Durant. But the boy's name was Durant. So I guess he was a Durant, but not a Durant, right?"<br><br>After a moment of babbling, she caught herself.<br><br>"Anyways, yeah, we just met, but we're friends. Miss Telrien and I are going to try to find my tutor and-" Dace stopped, and pushed her bag back around to the right side of her torso, "What does the person you're looking for look like?"<br>--------<br>A well-coifed, dark haired man in a white dress shirt and matching slacks pushed through the crowd of the dining car. Nopcsa had seen fit to discard the remnants of his cloak; it had been making him stand out. As for the other matter... Nopcsa slapped his hand down on an abandoned plate of spaghetti, and smeared the sauce across his shoulder. That'd conceal the bloody cut that Prime had left there, even if only for the moment. He felt the wound start stinging anew as the acidity of the sauce interacted with it.<br><br>Too bad. Better to sting a bit now and treat it later, than to have the medical crews show up to dole out first aid, and then inform the eminently surly Wally Creed of his whereabouts. Then he would receive first aid... and serve as a perfectly healthy anchor for them to trawl behind the train for the rest of journey.<br><br>Speaking of which... Nopcsa let his mental senses perk up a bit. Though it was only slightly less noisy than the actual soundscape, it would provide him proper warning if somebody noticed him.<br><br>That was, after all, one of the <i>many</i> perks of aggravating everybody he dealt with. Whenever they spotted him, it wasn't an <i>oh, there's nopcsa</i>. No, quite helpfully, the typical reaction was <i><b>HIM, THAT ASSHOLE MINDREADER</b></i>. It was like he went around installing convenient warning systems in everybody else's brains.<br><br>The minds around him were just about what he anticipated. There was a near monklike chanting of <i>This food is good</i> and its derivatives. If he focused more intently, he could actually feel the flavors and sensations that each diner was having. That was a special kind of diet food. All the flavors, none of the calories, and the only problem was the bizarre, ghostly sensation that somebody else was using your mouth to eat.<br><br>He supposed that was why he mostly stuck to skimming surface thoughts... If he went too deeply inside of somebody else's head, it was really easy to lose himself in it.<br><br>Nopcsa shoved past a fretting elven woman, noting the sparkling ruby resting over her heart. Even a surface glance at her mind showed that she treasured it more than life itself. <i>You'd best pray you don't encounter Telrien, Miss...</i><br><br>The mindreader avoided interacting with the woman, and earmarked her for further investigation later. After all, the gem seemed to have some sort of mystical significance, and he was sure the Fascere Order would be most interested in it. However, they had the rest of the train ride to sort this out. Going after high value targets early on would just leave the authorities a lot more time to investigate.<br><br>There wasn't much warranting further notice amongst the rest of the rabble. A few things worthy of blackmail, mayhap, but nothing that really stayed on objective. Throughout it all, though, there was a steady hum, soon growing irritating, and quickly heading well towards maddening. At first, he made the assumption that it was the wiring in their car, or possibly the wind whistling through some protuberance on the outside of the train.<br><br>However, even upon briefly covering his ears (the gesture disguised as brushing his hair into place), the sound had not diminished. No, this was quite clearly some mental phenomena that he had stumbled upon.<br><br>In his years of experience, Nopcsa had never encountered anything like this. People thought in snippets, sentences, or even in tunes, but this was a constant rising and falling drone, like the sound of a bee in flight. On occasion, the pitch would change, taking on a more satisfied tone, or a frustrated rising note.<br><br>There was still no traces of actual thought, however. Nopcsa considered delving deeper into the mind, to figure out more about the individual. He stopped himself with a shudder. Whatever <i>it</i> was, he really didn't want it going any further into his own head.<br><br>As he pressed through the crowds, he found there was another odd voice joining his mental hummingbird. This one, however, did have a familiar sound to it; it reminded him of a text to speech program. Microsoft Sam was directly dictating his actions with each thought.<br><br><i>As this slice of zucchini is too large to fit into our mouths, I shall slice it into smaller pieces.</i><br><br><i>The train we are on presently is shaking slightly with the turbulence from the air. The knives that they have provided in this dining car are expensive and well-honed. We must careful to avoid accidentally injuring ourself with something that sharp.</i><br><br>Nopcsa backed off mentally again, the humming draping around him again like a thick blanket.<br><br>It was growing louder, and that meant he was drawing closer. He entertained the notion that maybe his powers had grown so that he could hear the thoughts of flies buzzing against the glass, but quickly decided he'd prefer not to consider that.<br><br>The robot voice and the drone grew in volume to his left, meaning he had found the two. Turning his head, dreading what he might find, Nopcsa found himself gazing upon a pair of elementary age boys. One was clutching tightly to the other's shirtsleeve, while his brother cautiously worked at slicing up the food on their plate.<br><br><i>We have garnered the attention of a young man. He has somehow gotten tomato sauce on his shoulder. He is a messy eater.</i><br><br>The buzz seemed to take on a humored quality, almost sounding like stifled laughter. The two boys stared back at him, one with eyes full of empathy and amusement, the other with flat eyes that didn't even seem to regard him any differently than the wall behind him.<br><br>"Hello, sir. Are you doing well?" The calm boy asked, the other one smiling a half grin.<br><br>"Yeah, I'm... Yeah, doing well," Nopcsa responded, still not seeing any reaction.<br><br><i>This man appears to be behaving as if he's extremely nervous. It is quite possible that our unorthodox behavior is making him uneasy. On the other hand, it bears consideration that his agitation is not due to our present meeting, but instead stems from him being with </i> them.<br><br>"How about you gentlemen? Having a great time on the train here? Have any family with you?" Nopcsa threw out a series of questions, hoping to draw up some usable surface thoughts. If he could figure out where their parents were, that'd provide him a great opportunity to pawn them off and getting their nagging little voices out of his noggin.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Nopcsa's eyes flickered back and forth between the two youths, not sure on who was the right one to make eye contact with.

He may as well have been a mannequin for all the emotion his face betrayed, but the way his eyes moved...<br><br>They never met his own. This boy was sizing him up like a maze or a puzzle. No personal investment, no human connection, just a problem that needed solving.<br><br>Nopcsa felt the cut on his shoulder throb intensely. He considered turning and walking away, but quickly realized that would mean leaving his back exposed to the world's most adorable sociopath and his high quality steak knife.<br><br>"Hey, that's very responsible of you! It's good to see a brother who takes care of his sibling, instead of like, dunking his head in the toilet or whatever. Not that I'd know; I was an only child."<br><br>Nopcsa noted that the talker hadn't actually thought about the wherebouts of any family at any point. The boys were here alone, it seemed, and furthermore, there was somebody out there hunting for them.<br><br>Nopcsa had a hard time being sympathetic to their plight. They might have looked like children, but when you really examined their minds, they may as well have been robots in skin suits. Nopcsa knew the human mind, probably better than almost anybody else in the world. By his rubric, these two boys weren't human.<br><br>"It sure is nice to go on a vacation like this, isn't it? I mean, kids like you get to miss school, and guys like me, we get to skip work, and unwind."<br><br>The quiet one leaned forward intensely, tugging at his brother's arm.

But that was the thing with kids, they're shy one moment and brazen the next.<br> <br>“Thanks for the confidence, kid. I guess you could say I've been known for being able to find things. Nothing too extravagant though.” Tel's attention was brought to a blue gloved hand extended in front of her. <br><br>“I'm Flint,”  The teen said, a more friendly smirk on his face.

'Unge' means 'young' in Norse. ” Telrien said, doing her best to keep up with Dace's enthusiasm. “A Pokemon trainer, huh? I can't say I've ever met one before. I'm sure that takes allot of discipline!”<br><br>“Well, to be honest, this is the first time we've met in person.” Telrien's fingers fidgeted with her dress as she spoke, “We have only ever talked in text online before now. From what I've gathered he's about 173 centimeters to 183 centimeters tall, he has drown hair and he's wearing a black suit with a black pinstriped coat.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">A young girl, no older than six years old, plucked a plump, juicy strawberry from the pile in the large silver bowl sitting atop the table in between herself and her father. She dipped it in a second bowl full of chocolate dip and popped it into her mouth. Chocolate-covered strawberries weren't something they got very regularly, but they were probably one of her favorite snacks. Her hair cascaded down her back in long, wild, unkempt waves, with a pink peony hair clip pinned to the right side of her head, a present her father had picked up in China on one of their many travels. She wore a long, flowing cream dress made of light fabric, with long billowing sleeves and a bright red ribbon tied around the waist, her favorite and the one she wore for "special occasions."<br><br>A special occasion this was indeed. Luxury trains weren't normal fare for the Charbonneaus. Samuel spent most of his days as a deckhand on a ship, with any and all of his free time left spent in the cabins with his beloved daughter Miriam. He had saved two months' worth of pay and took some time off in order to treat themselves to a small vacation. Just as Miriam had worn her best dress, Sam wore the best suit he owned, which is to say he wore the only suit he owned: a secondhand number in navy blue, faded and ill-fitting on his large, towering frame. As much as he enjoyed this once-in-a-blue-moon brush with the upper class, Sam felt uncomfortable among the bourgeoisie and their habitat. He could feel them staring at the visible  tattoos on his body, the anchor on his neck, the rope around his wrist. He didn't have to look up to know that they walked by wrinkling their noses at his swarthy, ruddy complexion and his dark, shaggy mop of hair threatening to invade his range of vision.<br><br>All seen as minor inconveniences, however, as long as it meant that his daughter was having a good time, which she seemed to be having. Sam reached over and picked up a particularly voluptuous strawberry from the bowl, dunked it sparingly into the chocolate, and stuffed it into his mouth, chasing it with a sip of red wine from his glass. He couldn't remember the last time he had wine. Nice wine that didn't come from gas stations. Actually, this wine didn't really taste any better than five-dollar wine, but he could never admit that to the staff or else they'd laugh him off the train.<br><br>"Look, Daddy, the ocean!" Miriam pointed to the large window next to them. The train was passing over a tranquil, shimmering swath of water, bathed in pink and red hues by the sun sinking beneath the horizon. <br><br>"You're right. I don't think we've ever seen the ocean from this high up before. Isn't it beautiful?" The curiosity and awe on his little girl's face sent affection coursing through his veins, manifested in his warm, loving smile. The pair loved each other as if they only had each other to hold on to.<br><br>"Do you know the story of how the god of the sea found his wife?"<br><br>Sam shook his head. "I don't believe I do, actually."<br><br>"I read it in my book about Greek myths! Okay, so once upon a time Poseidon was really lonely, right? So he would cry and be sad a lot and that would make lots of storms happen and it sunk the sailors' ships and they drowned...."</div></div>

Was that why he was becoming more nervous? <br><br><i> It is evident that this man has been involved in violence, the sauce is a cover. Perhaps he is not here for us after all, but why is he so nervous then?</i><br><br>"This is not really a vacation for us. I believe that you can learn from anything in life. All information is useful."<br><br>Aaron turned a bit to face the man, holding onto the steak knife all the while. His brother was back to eating, but was wary now. <br><br><i> I cannot look very threatening, but we shall see how this man reacts. </i><br><br>With that thought in mind, Aaron turned the knife deliberately so that it's edge was angled at Nopcsa. <br><br>"If I may ask, sir, how did you get such a stain on your shoulder?"</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Felix crashed through the cabin's doors, almost shattering them. Luckily, the doors were quick enough to open before he showered guests in metal and glass. He stumbled to his feet, nudging a man who was talking to two children, and looked at the door with an almost manic look in his eyes. Nothing was following him. He could've sworn... No. Maybe the sheer amount of chemicals in his blood system was taking its toll on him. While keeping an eye on the door, he sighed and tried to maintain as neutral an expression on his face as possible. In his experience, lying worked best if he was insistent and kept good eye contact.<br><br>"Excuse me," a voice behind him came. He turned, maybe a little too quickly, and was face to face with a woman. Green hair barely concealed under a bandana, and a slightly concerned expression on her face. "Are you okay?"<br><br>He blinked, then realised she'd notice he'd nearly shattered to the doors on impact.<br><br>"Oh I'm fuckin' fine, trick of the mind, y'know," he said, as casually as he could while trying to keep an eye on the door. A sudden throb informed him that he wasn't completely fine. Probably a concussion, though a quick swipe of his forehead told him that he'd cut something up there. Just what he needed, a head wound. "Thought I saw some fuckin' cunt with a mask on and tentacles." Way to sound not crazy, Felix.<br><br>"It's okay, let me," the girl said. She closed her eyes briefly, then raised her hand. With that amount of speed, the girl clearly wasn't just an average human. Soldier training, Felix guessed. Her hand was barely an inch from his head, but he could already feel the throbbing sensation fading. Even better than Samm's pills. The girl lowered her hand, and Felix could feel himself completely fit again. On the down side, he was sober, but that was barely a price compared to a throbbing head and concussion that would render him incapable of alcohol for at least a day.<br><br>"Hey, thanks," Felix said, decisively keeping cuss words out of his vocabulary for once. "Probably needed that. Some fu-, I mean, something crossed my sight wrong, guess with all the Powers runnin' 'round, kinda spooked me a bit."<br><br>The girl laughed. "Yeah, I know what you mean. Never seen so many in one place! It's nice though."<br><br>"Nice? What d'you mean?"<br><br>"Oh, just... people don't like Powers, do they?" The girl replied, holding her arm carefully, as though she was nervous. Felix just nodded. Powers were very rarely a good conversation topic at the best of times. "Anyway, I figured I'd do my best as a medic for the train. I'll catch you later!"<br><br>The green-haired oddball rushed over to the man talking to the two children. Felix rubbed his forehead for a moment before turning around and headed back to the recreation room. <br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler3184025').toggle();if($('#spoiler3184025').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler3184025">reposted for chronology</div></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message"><i>Noting that the young man she'd accidently bumped into was too busy to have noticed the incident, Nagisa decided to continue looking for a safe place to sit and hide. Thankfully, that odd pain in her chest hadn't come back... but it sure as heck kept her on edge out of fear of it returning. As she walked through the car, Raijuu briefly mentioned to her about strange things going on in other parts of the train - warning her to be on guard in case of trouble. Apparently, as she could guess, she wasn't the only unnatural being on board this train. Or as some of her friends called them, "Powers". Nagisa never liked that term, because it was like labeling a person based on part of them. Rather racist, in a sense. But anyways, with people like that on the train, who knows what sort of adventure or danger lay ahead for all. It made Nagisa smile, being that she'd feared of being the only magical sort on board a train full of ordinary humans - and everyone knows how awkward as hell that could be, esp. if you don't fully look human in appearance.<br><br>Finding a seat at last, in a booth that conveniently had a curtain (Raijuu called it lucky, but Nagisa didn't trust it entirely), she sat down in a corner and tried relaxing... her eyes closed &amp; calming her breathing in the same manner that Kaina'mei had taught her to use while meditating. Placing her hands over the Phoenix Ruby, she focused on letting Raijuu peer inside her chest. Her hands faintly glowed a golden yellow, and the dragonic being scanned every inch of her mighty heart.</i><br><br>Raijuu: [[ I discovered the source of your pain, but you're not going to like what it is. Apparently, there's a very tiny high-tech device attached to part of your heart - lightly brushing against the lung on that side. I can sense that it's activation is what caused your pain, and it seems to be giving off some kind of tracking frequency, as well as some other electronic wavelength I'm not sure on its purpose. ]]<br><br>Nagisa: "Can you destroy it or remove it from me somehow?"<br><br>Raijuu: [[ Forgive me, but it'd be too dangerous to try. If I were to destroy or remove it, that might disrupt the rhythm of your heart or greatly damage that part of it. The least I can do for now is block whatever frequencies it's giving off. Then you'll be safe a while from whoever's using that device.]]<br><br><i>And at that moment, Raijuu jammed the device. It didn't turn off, but the tracker signal of it became useless. Nagisa wondered what sort of fiend managed to get that thing into her without her even knowing about or feeling it. Guess this trip wouldn't be as fun an adventure as she'd hoped after all, with someone tracking and monitoring her like some kind of wild animal. And whoever this person was, they'd have a lot of explaining to do after she gave them a good ass kicking for messing with her...</i><br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><i>Haji Meiwaku just entered the beginning of the main dining car when all of a sudden, the tracker screen on his wristcom went blank. Swearing aloud, he checked to make sure he hadn't accidently shut it off somehow. It was still on, but the tracker was dead. At least the EKG monitor was functioning... and showing the heart of his target was now beating a bit stronger than it'd been before. Though frustrated he no longer could track his target, he grinned at the EKG as he tried to envision what the powerful heart pumping inside of his target's chest might look like. His creepy daydream was then brought crashing back to reality when he got bumped into by a rowdy passenger who'd had too much to drink apparently.</i><br><br>Drunkard: "Oh sharries, professers. dign't see yous there. My bad."<br><br>Haji: "That's 'Doctor', good sir. And you sound like you could use a place to go sober up. Also, I'd advise you drink some water."<br><br>Drunkard: "A doctor? Oh, my meestake. Hey, heard a whiles back some folks in another car be needin a doctor. You sherd go find out what's up with that." *hic*<br><br><i>Haji wondered what that might be about, and considered maybe it might be a good idea to go asking around about this matter. After all, if the heart of his target is beating faster, perhaps it's a sign of the target being in some kind of distress? If he were to present himself to security as a doctor, getting his hands on his target would be a piece of cake...</i><br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler8675083').toggle();if($('#spoiler8675083').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler8675083">Hey guys, the convo with Haji and that guy was loud enough for plenty of folks in the dining car to overhear.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">“Well, that’s a funny story. I was just sitting down, trying to enjoy my dinner, when this guy with a plate of spaghetti-“ Nopcsa paused. If the buzzing had words, it would’ve been crying “Bullshit!” loud enough for non-telepaths to hear.<br><br><i>He’s lying again.</i><br><br>Aaron sat up slightly in his seat, bending his knees as if he was getting ready to jump to his feet. The knife went from an angle to pointing more directly towards Nopcsa’s chest, the boy’s diminutive digits clutching it in a deathgrip.<br><br>The boy finally met Nopcsa’s gaze, and <i>still</i> the emotions hadn’t changed. If he stabbed Nopcsa, it would be about as upsetting to the child as had he stubbed a toe. Less, probably. The mindreader wasn’t detecting any hesitation, any empathy, just necessity and a willingness to get things done. He was seriously considering flipping the table and bailing, when his guardian angel came bursting into the room like a comet from the heavens.<br><br>More accurately, his skunky smelling, bloodshot eyed guardian angel faceplanted his way through the automatic doors. Nopcsa had always compared reading the mind of an intoxicated individual to reading words on a page through a colored filter, and this man’s brain was positively kaleidoscopic. Instantly, Nopcsa realized the opportunity he’d been presented with.<br><br>Though the emotionless boy seemed unsurprised, he’d quickly moved on to analyzing the newcomer, leaving Nopcsa to his own devices. The young man started to turn to leave, when he noticed a woman with green hair entering their car. He paused in mid-spin, almost tripping over himself as he stumbled to a halt.<br><br>A brief scan of her mind confirmed that yes, she was a Summoner. This was becoming ridiculous. First two inhuman munchkins, then an elf, then some sort of narcotics-elemental, and now a war criminal with mystical powers… After a moment, Nopcsa mentally appended “and a telepath”. He chided himself for the instant that he regarded himself as less special and extraordinary than those around him.<br><br>That burst of clarity and perspective was what it took for Nopcsa to get his head back in the game. However warped, unsettling, and just plain wrong the boys were, they weren’t Powers. He’d dealt with worse. He could just tune them out, and waltz away like nothing had happened. If one of them went after him, despite his slender build and lack of muscle, he was sure he’d still have the upper hand. Maybe he could put a hand on each head, and hold them at bay like a schoolyard bully. Everything was under control.<br><br>And that woman seemed to be a healer, free of charge.<br><br>“My arm!” Nopcsa wailed, gesticulating wildly to indicate his wounded shoulder, “That man just slashed my arm wide open!”<br><br>He pushed in nearer to Iliana, wildly gyrating the joint near her face.<br><br>“When he smashed through the doors, he bumped something into me, and now look at me! I’m bleeding out!”<br><br>He could hear the boy start to talk, and immediately started talking over him, dialing up his histrionics to demand the Summoner’s attention even more.<br><br>“I think I’m going into shock!” He lurched wildly, making sure that it took him towards the woman with the magic hands, and away from the little psychopaths.<br><br>“You can help me, right Miss? Don’t let me diiieee like this!” Nopcsa threw himself to his knees before her, still keeping his shoulder angled towards her.<br><br>“Please! I’ve got so much to live for! Think of how dark the world would be without me!” Nopcsa continued bemoaning his fate even though he could already feel her healing the wound. The familiar numbness and ephemeral tingling of curative magic set in, extinguishing the stinging and drawing a pleasant, soothing warmth to the area.<br><br>“Are you going to have to amputate my arm? What if the door gave me tetanus? If I get lockjaw, I won’t be able to eat any of the wonderful food here!”<br><br>Nopcsa angled his head slightly, regarding the expression of the Summoner. The moment he was sure that she was done with him, he’d be making tracks.<br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler9876121').toggle();if($('#spoiler9876121').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler9876121">OOC: Wanted to do a massive post, but realized that I should deal with ending this brief exchange before getting into other plots.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Startled though she was by the man's energy, Illiana promptly shut out what he was saying when she realised a lot of it was probably just dramatics. She wouldn't have minded him flailing around a bit less since he only had a fairly simple wound that wouldn't even take a minute to heal. Somehow he'd gotten some food, tomato sauce she guessed, all over his jacket around the wound. Either this guy was extremely clumsy, or... Well, that was none of her business.<br><br>"All done," she said, cutting through his rambling. She turned away without even looking at his face and made her way through the door that definitely did <i>not</i> give the guy tetanus. She'd been watching the dark haired man as he fell through the door and she was almost positive that he hadn't touched the other man.<br><br>She passed through the next carriage without incident. Apparently food had been served or the trolley had been around or something along those lines since the majority of the passengers were currently digging into what looked like gourmet meals. She didn't have any urge to sit down and eat just yet, though, since she'd eaten not that long ago. She continued walking, the doors sliding open silently.<br><br>Her movement through the train continued in the same manner until she came across a room that barely had anyone in it. She could see a couple of tables, some chairs and a stack of boxes against the wall. A pool table, dartboard, a large television and a shelf crammed full of DVDs. One of the tables, she noticed, already had a game set up on it. She glanced down the boxes to see what was available. Monopoly, Scrabble, Operation... Some of these games would be wildly unfair if they were playing against people with superhuman intelligence or reflexes. She glanced at the table to see which game had been set up.<br><br>With a small grin, she picked three random cards out - one suspect, one weapon and one room card - and put them into the supplied envelope, which she slid under the board for safekeeping. Then, she picked up the dice and rolled. She moved the Miss Scarlet playing piece four steps towards the Hall, then continued up the train.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Flint began to eye the other passengers in the car. "You're right almost every person on this train fits the description or is close. This is going to be hard." He said as he turned to Telrien. <br><br>Attempting to remember every person he had seen so far, Flint wandered over to the window hoping a view would help him concentrate.  Frost began to collect on the windows edges as he fell into thought.  "Wait, why am I putting this much thought in? I don't really care if she finds this person." He thought to himself.  Glancing out the window one last time he realized that he had created an iceberg on the water.  <br><br>A ship appeared on the horizon and slowly cruised forward, eventually colliding with the floating ice cap.  The words Titanic III could be read on the side of the ship as its hull was dragged beneath the vast expanse of water.<br><br>Quickly attempting to get away from the scene Flint turned to the girls and said, "Maybe we should try other carts."</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Sarosin slowed as he exited the bar, having a sneaking suspicion that someone was going to be following him. But who? Surely not the spastic blonde inebriate; he'd barely even interacted with her. Yoshimitsu? Ehh. Maybe. That didn't sit quite right with him though. <br><br>He listened, not turning around, as the door latched shut just a little too late. There was definitely someone behind him. <br><br>Well. That was fine. <br><br>He increased his pace, crossing the remaining length of the car with broad, casual strides as he patted the pilfered wallet in his pocket, and exited the car. Here he slid the door shut behind him and stepped to the side, waiting for his tail to catch up with him.<br><br>It didn't take long. Maybe half a minute later, the door slid open again and the bespectacled man from the bar stepped out and right into Sarosin.<br><br>"'llo," Sarosin drawled, grinning haughtily at his new friend.
