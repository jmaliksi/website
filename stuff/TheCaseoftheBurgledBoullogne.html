        <div class="content"><div class="message"><i>OOC: Here we have a real ground-breaker: the first invitational RP to which</i> no one is invited!<br><br><i>Okay, not quite. However, for the moment I’m asking that nobody else enter this RP. Before long, the main character will exit the building and then other people will have the chance to jump in. And then I’m really hoping that people will join and mix things up a bit, but I’ll expound on that a little later.<br><br>For now, if no more characters can enter, then WHAT IS THE POINT? To learn the answer, maybe you’d better go have a look at <a rel="nofollow" href="http://archipelagoexodus.proboards.com/index.cgi?action=display&amp;board=orp2&amp;thread=2610" target="_blank">this topic</a>. <br><br>Yes, in true Andrew Hussie style, what I offer up before you now is a character fueled entirely by reader suggestions. More detail on that in the other topic. But what it means is that this is going to be an RP about as unlike Ishkabibble as possible in terms of planning ahead. I’ve got a very definite idea of how this story will end, but virtually no clue how it’ll get there. That’s for us to work out together. Soon you’ll be able to influence the story by bringing in characters, but for now, just read the rest of this post and then <b><font color="Red">head over to the Registre to make some suggestions</font></b></i>[/color].<br><br>That’s important so I’ll stress it again: <b><font color="Red">No suggestions in this topic please!</font></b> They should all be over in the Registre instead.<br><br>All right awesome. Here we go. Are you guys excited? I’m pretty excited.[/i]<br><br><br>Iridescent bubbles drifted lazily up to the ceiling to burst on the points of the iron chandelier overhead. Though the chandelier’s many bulbs were unlit, the bubbles gleamed well enough from the sunlight streaming in through the open window. An image charming in its way, Renard thought, but perhaps not life-changing enough to merit the future inconvenience of wiping the chandelier down with a rag. Nonetheless he’d need to stand on a chair if it came to wiping off the ceiling so really if the bubbles had to pop anywhere the chandelier was doubtless the easiest option.<br><br>Of course as far as probing and insightful questions went one couldn’t do better than to ask why the pipe was producing bubbles when he had plainly packed it with tobacco and lit it with a match a moment earlier. <br><br>However, this might have been a question rather <i>too</i> probing and insightful. The empirical fact was that every pipe Renard had ever packed with tobacco and lit with a match had subsequently produced bubbles. He had experimented with many pipes, many brands of tobacco, and many, many matches, with results perfectly uniform. Accepting this as immutable had been, ultimately, the last available choice. To investigate further might broach some grievous cosmic aberration and Renard could only broach so many of those before lunch and just now it was not even eleven o’clock in the morning.<br><br>A more mundane but quite pragmatic and certainly much safer question was why Renard had packed the pipe with tobacco and lit it with a match a moment earlier if he was aware that the result would not be that which is commonly expected and desired when a pipe is packed with tobacco and lit with a match. As memorable a metaphysical <i>faux pas</i> as this ought to have been, the sad and noble truth was that Renard’s mind functioned on altogether purer and less error-ridden planes and that it was really very easy for him to lose track of what he was doing at any given moment, a problem only exacerbated by the fact that for some reason he had elected to set the small box of tobacco with enclosed matchbook and the tiny plastic bottle of pink bubble juice next to each other on the table before him.<br><br>Obviously if he’d been thinking on the level of worldly concerns he would have filled the pipe from the bottle instead of the box.<br><br>But never let it be said that Renard was a man easily weighed down by the regrets of the past. Let it not even be considered that he was now chastising himself for filling the pipe with the wrong material. All he could do was allow the bubbles to run their course and then move on. He could always pour out the pipe into the sink but that would be a waste of good tobacco.<br><br><div align="center"><img src="http://i322.photobucket.com/albums/nn433/asgardreid/renard.png" style="max-width: 100%;"></div><br><br>He tried to put a bit of space between the small box of tobacco with enclosed matchbook and the tiny plastic bottle of pink bubble juice, yet found it difficult: there were so many items scattered over the wooden table that little surface area remained unoccupied. Assorted dishes, cutleries and drinking vessels rubbed shoulders as it were with notepads, loose sheets of paper and writing implements, while salt and pepper shakers flanked vases of faintly downtrodden-looking flowers, the magnifying glass looked poised to collapse from where it had been delicately stood against the outstretched arm of a miniature chevalier statue, and the camera lay half-obscured by a striped towel all the way at the opposite end of the table from the smattering of grainy photographs it had most recently produced. Surely the element that really set this whole thing off best was the centerpiece, a precarious stack of newspapers nearly two feet in height.<br><br>Renard dearly loved reading the paper but he had been disappointed with his haul from the last couple of weeks. There was very little of interest in the headlines but the continued investigations into the attacks that had occurred at that restaurant and the hotel downtown.<br><br>Child’s play. Why Renard thought the solution to this mystery was quite obvious and it was a wonder to him that no one had yet accepted his hypothesis. Clearly the bombings at the hotel had been engineered by someone with a vendetta against hotels and therefore against travelling in general. A radical nationalist and isolationist, this fellow would have been trying to send an ultimatum to the other countries of the world: <i>Take your tourism elsewhere! The Archipelago has no taste for foreigners!</i> Doubtless the damage perpetrated upon the cars in the garage would have reflected the other aspect of this plan: the culprit meant to encourage the denizens of the Archipelago to <i>stay in</i> and not expose themselves to the impurities of the outside world. Granted it was already impossible to leave the Archipelago by car but Renard was helpless to account for the maniacal logic of these bomb-brandishing fanatics. The instant he figured out how the restaurant attack factored into the equation he would be submitting his report to the grateful authorities and another mystery would be solved.<br><br>All in a morning’s work. Quite tiresome really. Renard hoped mightily that today’s newspaper would bring some more interesting news. He was prepared to take on a new case at the drop of a hat.</div></div>

He had already combed the material quite thoroughly for potential leads and since this was a matter to which he always devoted the extent of his considerable brain power he doubted there was anything he might now find promising. He was glancing idly at the real estate section when he noticed an odd bit of discoloration around the bottom left region of his field of view. He looked at the floor. There were small drops of some dark red substance on the wooden floorboards.<br><br>Why in fact they might have been drops of blood.<br><br>Now this was interesting. Renard held very still and, puffing his pipe silently, listened for any unexpected noises within the apartment. If there was an injured person bleeding freely somewhere in here, Renard was certain their suffering would be telegraphed by some manner of moans or groans. But there was not a sound save for the rumble of the cars without.<br><br>His eyes moved along the floorboards, following the tiny red splashes, which formed a zigzagging line out of the living room. Renard glanced over at the bedroom door, but it was still shut and the blood didn't approach it. A small blessing. There were sensitive materials on the floor of the bedroom and he would have been considerably distressed to learn that an unknown party had gotten inside and was now bleeding liberally all over Renard's collection. No, instead the drops led into the kitchen, and Renard followed.<br><br>He was expecting to find a fresh corpse on the tiles, perished perhaps in the act of reaching out to spell the name of his murderer with the alphabet magnets on the refrigerator, but instead found that the drops went as far as the umbrella stand and then ceased.<br><br>Renard considered this. Oh, actually, yes, the pieces coagulated in his mind. He distinctly remembered scraping his ankle on a sharp corner of the angular umbrella stand when he had been fixing coffee in here earlier. Yes and in fact that went a good ways toward explaining the dull throb that had been lingering at his ankle since. He looked back into the living room. The trail of blood reached the table under the chandelier and then doubled back alongside itself to where he was now standing.<br><br>Really quite inconvenient. He wondered why he'd placed the umbrella stand with the massive black-and-white-striped umbrella here in the kitchen in the first place. Possibly he'd meant to leave himself a weapon in the event that one of his cooking experiments gained sentience and reared up from the oven to attack.<br><br>At any rate, the umbrella and stand were far from the only objects here whose placement in a kitchen seemed somewhat dubious. For instance, the box of fingerprint powder next to the telephone on the counter (in the event that he suspected someone else had used his telephone without his consent?), the tape measure on the windowsill over the oven (to measure the maximum width possible of a burglar who had exited through the window given the known width of the object with which he'd absconded?), and the lockpick threaded through the handles of the refrigerator's and freezer's doors (to prevent unhealthy snacking?). Altogether Renard was sure that at some point he would have to call upon his powers of diplomacy to negotiate an exchange of goods between the kitchen and the living room and sort everything out. Not the bedroom, however. The bedroom's contents belonged just where they were.<br><br>After yanking open a few creaky cabinets, he eventually found the medical kit and applied a bandage to his minorly injured ankle. Then he located a rag and set about wiping the blood off the kitchen and living room floors, his mind on too lofty matters to notice the parallel trail of soapy bubble juice leading over his head between the kitchen and living room ceilings.</div></div>

Unfortunately he had slipped behind on his phone bill as of late and the service appeared to have been cancelled until payment was to resume. As such Renard was forced to finish wiping the droplets of blood off the living room floor in peace.<br><br>As he stood up, he cast a critical eye over the blurry photographs at one end of the table. They'd come out horridly. As strapped as Renard was for jobs and therefore funding at the moment, it didn't help that he kept tossing money at the employees of Albarello on the expectation that they would actually manage to develop the photographs taken by his antique folding camera. They were running him into poverty with these smudgy indecipherable returns. He had half a mind to lodge a formal complaint.<br><br>It was around this moment that he noticed he'd been letting the bubbles pop on the ceiling, leaving wet rings up out of his reach.<br><br>Muttering a curse in his original tongue, he hurried to the window over the chaise longue and pulled it open. He leaned forward on the windowsill and poked his head through to puff the remaining bubbles out into the open air. Thus positioned, Renard gazed down from his third-story apartment onto the city street. The early afternoon was still gray, with a fleecy sheet of clouds overhead, yet Winstone City was as busy as ever. The street was carpeted with cars, some personal but many of them taxicabs, from within which issued muffled music and the occasional impatient honk. Pedestrians scurried on the sidewalks back and forth between the businesses on the ground level. Though many of the buildings rose well above Renard's eye level, he could occasionally make out in the gaps between the imposing steely structures some glimpse of the older Japanese-styled towers at the city's northern fringe. Tranquil, serene, they seemed to stand many miles away from this crowded city block. But their beauty didn't beckon to Renard. The only mysteries in that oldest part of town were the ancient ones, passed down by the native citizens of the Archipelago. Here in the heart of the city was where his calling truly lay.<br><br>His reverie was interrupted in the happiest of ways. A familiar, beloved mechanical growl came up to him from the street directly below. The mailman was here.<br><br>Beaming, Renard paused to watch the last bubble pop on the metal staircase overhead before withdrawing into the living room (pocketing the pipe). His favorite time of day had arrived. Surely there'd be something in the newspaper to catch his interest! He couldn't wait to dash downstairs and greet the mailman in the lobby. He'd be off at a run the very moment that he found his shoes.<br><br>He stopped. He couldn't find his shoes.<br><br>Renard wheeled slowly on the spot, his bare feet (except for the bandage on the one ankle) making a circle on the living room floor. There was the camera, there was the magnifying glass, there was the notepad... there weren't the shoes.<br><br>His heart pounded. To exit the apartment unshod was out of the question. The lobby floor would be too dirty even for socks, and besides, it was unbefitting a gentleman of his caliber. His fine black shoes had to be somewhere. He looked in the kitchen. Nowhere. Quite vanished.<br><br>He couldn't have left them in the bedroom, could he?<br><br><i>Non.</i> Inconceivable. The very suggestion that Renard might take such impure artifacts, forever seared with the stench of Winstone's gutter, into the bedroom was almost too much for his delicate mind to bear. Why the air in the bedroom had to be pristine and perfect! How else could he preserve his collection? How could he possibly sully the atmosphere with such odious odors? Even if his thoughts hadn't been on such matters when he'd returned home the previous evening, he should not have been able to tread into the bedroom with his shoes on even unwittingly! The very muscles under his skin should have protested with an instinct honed over the years and years since he had begun his collection! He should have been rendered paralyzed on the spot!<br><br>He stood stock-still in front of the bedroom door. At this point his heart was threatening to put a dent in his ribcage. He would not, could never, dare to believe that this might be true.<br><br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler5152346').toggle();if($('#spoiler5152346').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler5152346"><i>OOC: Once Renard locates his shoes (wherever they might possibly be!) and goes downstairs, he’ll meet the mailman. So we’ll have the first opportunity for someone else to jump in if they like. Right now, if anyone wants to RP the mailman/mailwoman/</i>postal service worker<i>, I’ll give them like 24 hours to write a post, right here, the next post in this topic, in which </i>that character of unspecified gender<i> gets out of the mail truck and enters the apartment building’s lobby to distribute the mail.<br><br>If no one seems interested I’ll just auto the mailperson myself, but I wanted to toss the option out there in case anyone’d like to have some fun with the part. I don’t have any ideas about the mailperson’s person…ality, except that presumably they would recognize Renard as a familiar tenant, whether they’d look on his nineteenth-century demeanor as quaintly amusing or distinctly off-putting or whatever.<br><br>In general I guess you guys might be better off not thinking of this as a normal RP in the sense that the main character starts up an adventure and is promptly joined by a handful of companions who stay by his side for the duration of the story. For Renard to have anyone following him around will necessitate that those characters also must, to some degree, comply with reader directions and I imagine that’d just get kind of ungainly and vexing. And, I’ll admit, I kind of like the idea of Renard taking on the overall story by himself. Particularly for the ending I have in mind, he’d be better off alone.<br><br>I said that I hoped other people would join and I totally mean that! But what I’m thinking is that instead of other characters entering as members of Renard’s party, they would be better enrolled for individual scenes based on their function in the story, associated with particular locations/occupations/etc. Intersecting with Renard for their one or two scenes, but not running parallel to his for the whole story.<br><br>No, that doesn’t mean that every other character in this story needs to be the likes of a lowly mailperson. There should be opportunities later on for other peoples’ actual established RP characters to weigh in. But, again, these would probably be for single scenes, so just know that that’s the ideal situation. All right so anyone want to be the lowly mailperson or what? Like I said, right here, next post.</i></div></div></div>

With every cough and splutter, the Jeep would seize and lurch, jarring his hunched back and aggravating the sciatica that plagued him when the weather turned.<br><br>‘Too old for this.’ How long had he been saying that? Last he’d thought of it, he’d been too old for anything for about ten years now.<br><br>The truck was long overdue for an alignment, so he took the corners in wide, sweeping arcs, gripping the steering wheel with white knuckles as it threatened to pitch out of his hands and send the whole machine end over end into the offices and townhouses that lined these commercia-dental Winstone blocks. <br><br>As the Jeep leveled out, he glanced up at the yellowing scrap of paper taped to the molding, quivering sunflap. ‘<i>Neither rain nor sleet nor snow..</i><br><br>‘Ah, shut up.’ he muttered, slapping the flap with a mottled hand and shutting the mantra out of his sight.<br><br>The Jeep puttered to a pitiful halt in front of the apartments, gave a great gasp, backfired loudly, and died. The mailman sighed and grabbed his bag.<br><br>‘Morning, Waylon.’ he nodded to the young colored doorman as the boy swung the teaked and glassed door wide open, gloved hand extended to help an old man up the steps. He beamed, and his dark face seemed to vanish into a brilliant display of immaculate teeth.<br><br>‘And a fine morning to you, Mr. Breck. How’s the day treating you?’ Always chipper. Algernon never forgot to tip. He knew the value of forced kindness.<br><br>‘Fair, fair. These clouds are gonna break my back.’ he gave a half-hearted wave towards his backside, and his sciatic nerve throbbed in response. He clenched his jaw as the ripples traveled up his spine and into his shoulders. ‘Just come to drop off the bills.’<br><br>‘Of course, Mr. Breck.’ Waylon flashed another thousand-watt smile and turned to tend the next tenant,  thrusting the door wide, extending the white gloved hand in the same fashion.

Honestly they didn't even really smell particularly terrible in the grand scheme of things. He returned to the living room, fetched a fresh pair of black socks off the bookshelf, obviously, and clad his feet with meticulous care, making quite sure not to upset the bandage as he slid a sock over one shin.

The beak-like spathe and crown of petals, or what were they called, those weren't all petals, formed the semblance of an elegant waterbird streaked with brilliant orange, yellow and blue. Perfectly marvelous. A testament to the <i>design</i>, to the deliberation, of nature; a simple, graceful argument against the notion that all evolution boiled down to was a lot of random forces butting against each other for billions of years on end. Yes, this bird was a real treasure. Renard could not for the life of him remember why he had left it just outside the apartment like that. He was lucky it hadn't been stolen by now.<br><br>No matter. Renard resumed his poise and, despite limping slightly, nonetheless managed to bound down two flights of stairs to the lobby. Ah, there he was in front of the mailboxes. Renard's dearest friend. Renard greeted him with hands outstretched. The arms of his baggy coat slid back almost to his elbows.<br><br>"<i>Bonjour, monsieur</i> Algernon! <i>Bonjour!</i> And how are you this fine day?"<br><br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler390315').toggle();if($('#spoiler390315').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler390315"><i>OOC: Biscuit, Renard’s mail includes, above all else, the Winstone Post, and past that… I don’t know.

        <h2 class="poster">The Evil Biscuit</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Algernon heard him long before he saw him; the hollow thump and clatter of Renard's footsteps sounded more akin to someone flinging a grand piano down the brassed and veneered stairwell with considerable prejudice. He slid the letters in his hand through a mailslot and reached in his bag for the twine-bound bundle of far too familiar items. With some effort, he produced a folded edition of the <i>Winstone Post</i>, with several red-rimmed envelopes of varying thicknesses tucked snugly into the center crease. <br><br>'Why anyone would be so excited over late bills is... ah, <i>here we go</i>-'<br><br> "<i>Bonjour, Monsieur</i> Algernon! <i>Bonjour!</i> And how are you this fine day?" He looked particularly eccentric today. Breck gave a warm chuckle as his biggest fan came caterwauling off the banisters into the marbled lobby. <br><br>'Trying to survive, my boy, trying to survive. Don't ever get old.' he joked as he patted the bound parcel. 'Let's see what the city's got to say to you today, yeah?' With a single, practiced tug, the string fell away and the <i>Post</i> unfolded like a great gray flower in Breck's hand. He licked his thumb and began separating the bills - so many bills. <br><br>'Late notice. Late notice. Second notice. Late notice. <i>Final notice</i>. Better pay that one, Renard. Late notice. Census. Ah, here we go.' Algernon picked up a large blue envelope and held it to the light. 'Correspondence from a Mister... Mister... Missus? Oh, hell.' His eyes were fading, just like the rest of him; he handed the letter over to Renard. 'Mister or Missus Somebody. Either way, that's the first personal letter for you in a while, isn't it? Could be more work!' He puncuated this statement with the soft clap of the newspaper snapping closed in his hands; he presented the bundle to Renard with all the ceremony of a knight presenting a sword.<br><br> 'Your mail, sir.'  <br></div></div>

What a bundle of glorious promises folded endlessly upon themselves was the Post -- promises of secrets, conundrums and enigmas without measure, just waiting to be unraveled by the application of a mind like his own! But he couldn't read the paper here in the lobby. That would spoil his enjoyment. Renard saw nothing wrong with indulging in a habit or two, and the routine of perusing the paper back upstairs in his own well-worn rocking chair was one he had no intention to break.<br><br>Instead he nodded along as Algernon counted off the bills. "Mm, <i>oui</i>, yes, yes, ah, <i>oui</i>, mm, <i>epouvantable</i>, yes," he murmured in syncopation with the mailman's rhythm. But their duet trailed off once Algernon held up the envelope in pale blue.<br><br>"Mister or Missus Somebody. Either way, that's the first personal letter for you in a while, isn't it? Could be more work!"<br><br>Algernon handed the letter to Renard, followed by the rest of the bundle. Renard scrutinized the scrawl on the envelope, his curiosity about the newspaper for once overwhelmed by this unexpected gift. Ah but he recognized the handwriting immediately.<br><br>"A lead? Oh, I doubt it. Most likely she simply wants to check in..." Renard drew a finger across the last name on the return address. Her handwriting <i>was</i> dreadful, but Renard could tell by the change in Algernon's expression that he'd seen the connection. "She worries about me a great deal, you know. Well, so it is..."<br><br>Renard moved back toward the staircase, shifting the entire heap into the crook of one arm so as to wave a cheery goodbye to his benefactor. "<i>Merci beaucoup, monsieur</i> Algernon! Until tomorrow, then! Good luck in the rest of your travels!"<br><br>When he was out of view of the lobby, he began ascending the two flights of stairs much more quickly, two stairs at a step. He was even more excited to get back to the apartment than normal. <i>Two</i> pieces to examine! Furthermore a windfall of bills but those could wait until after he'd had his fun. Up the wooden stairs, past the first floor, and finally onto his own hallway, where he expertly avoided bashing a foot on the bird of paradise's pot as he rushed to the door and turned the doorknob.<br><br>It didn't budge.<br><br>Renard hesitated, then tried it again. For the sake of thoroughness he next tried turning it the other way. The door was locked.<br><br>Had he really not been paying attention at all when he left the apartment? He'd locked the door as he'd left? But he wasn't -- He set the mail down on the floor and patted down his pockets. No, there was the pipe, but otherwise he wasn't carrying anything. He'd left his keys inside the apartment.<br><br>He took off his coat and inverted the lining of every pocket. Nothing. He was locked out.<br><br>Half a moment. That couldn't be right. The image of a loose key, not on a ring, floated up in his mind. He was sure he'd stashed a spare key somewhere in this hallway. A backup planted precisely with an eye toward this kind of eventuality. <i>Tres bien.</i> There was a key somewhere within reach. He merely had to find it. He rubbed an eye and pondered where to look.<br><br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler8481391').toggle();if($('#spoiler8481391').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler8481391"><i>OOC: Thanks again, Biscuit! I guess we can bid adieu to Algernon Breck now, although you're welcome to send him off with another post if you like. As for Waylon, keep him in reserve if you don't mind. Once Renard first leaves the apartment building, I suspect he'll find reason to come back later in the day...<br><br>No, Pohatu! Don't say that!

However he thought better of it when he remembered that this was the foot he had cut earlier on the umbrella stand and that he really shouldn't exert any unnecessary force on it until it had healed. He lifted the other foot up with the same intention, only to lower it again when he remembered that this was the foot he had bruised against the bird of paradise's pot and that he really shouldn't put this one through too much work either if it came to that.<br><br>Grievously disappointed by the state of his podalic extremities, Renard spent a few moments calculating the angle and speed necessary to smash through the wood with his shoulder when he realized it. Of course. The bird of paradise! He must have buried the spare key inside the flowerpot. Why else would he have left the thing on the doorstep instead of taking it into his apartment?<br><br>With a mental clap on the back in praise of his superb foresight and cunning, Renard knelt down by the bird of paradise and scrabbled around in the dirt with a couple of fingers, expecting at any moment to come up against a metallic object. Nothing. Frowning, he began to paw at the dirt with both hands, prying the <i>Strelitzia reginae</i>'s roots aside in the hope that he'd find the key entangled among them. There was no key. There was nothing at his fingertips but dirt and plant matter. He sat back on his haunches and thought about it for a bit.<br><br>Then he took hold of the entire ceramic pot and lifted it. There was a small black key sitting on the floorboards underneath.<br><br>Renard sat the flowerpot back down a few centimeters displaced and took the key. He stood up and pushed the key into the doorknob. With a click and a turn, the door opened.<br><br>At once, Renard hurried to the kitchen sink to wash off his sullied hands, grateful that he still had running water at least. Then he returned to the hallway to pick up the mail and his coat, and to hide the key again under the flowerpot. As he completed this last action, he noticed that he seemed to have upset the <i>Strelitzia reginae</i> a bit in his search. The old bird looked distinctly off-kilter. With his free hand, Renard gently nudged the flower upright. It promptly listed back to its inclined position. Ah well. It was a living being; it could take care of itself. And Renard had much more pressing matters to attend to at the moment. He stepped back into his apartment and shut the door.<br><br>He tossed the bills onto the living room table, where the native herd of bills promptly took the newcomers in as their own after a minimal period of social adjustment. Then Renard fetched the tiny plastic bottle of pink bubble juice off the table and settled into his rocking chair with his two new treasures, the pale blue envelope and the day's newspaper.<br><br>He procured the pipe from his pocket and filled it with juice from the bottle, then took a gentle puff. The first wisp of smoke curled up into the living room.<br><br>Then, holding the pipe in his mouth, he sundered the pale blue envelope and extracted the letter from within. Of course, she had written it in French.<br><br><hr><font face="Georgia"><i>My dearest and only son,<br><br>How beautiful this morning is!

He was looking at a proper quandary! Confounded the police, had it? Renard waved a hand in dismissal. That was only because they needed an expert. Yes, the policemen with their guns were all well and good for apprehending criminals and flushing them out of their hiding places and engaging in standoffs, but what this case required was a mind with <i>subtlety</i>. With some real sophistication. A mind able to find something Commissioner Williams couldn't see.<br><br>Very good. This, then, was his mission.

Perhaps there was an item, or set of items, which he had found severely lacking in quality and for which he might manage to coax a cash refund from the establishment that had supplied this item or set of items to him. This was an oddly specific idea to pop into his head all at once like that yet the more he thought about it the more he suspected that it was a positively ideal notion requiring a minimum of effort on his part and that he was sure to come up with an item or set of items which qualified if he only set his mind to it.</div></div>

He was already taking his pipe, the small box of tobacco with enclosed matchbook, the tiny plastic bottle of pink bubble juice, the stack of photographs, his wallet, and his keys. That left quite a bit of room for other items of importance. He strode into the kitchen, back into the living room, and back again into the kitchen, taking note of all that he saw. It was time to decide what else he would need to carry on his person as he plunged headlong into this perplexing mystery.</div></div>

The notebook, pencil, and two pens he picked up off the table and stashed in an internal pocket of his coat. Likewise the magnifying glass and folded-in camera although these were rather larger and therefore had to be stored in the outer pockets. In the kitchen, he removed the box of fingerprint powder from its place next to the telephone, and the lockpick from its place through the handles of the refrigerator and freezer, and tucked them into the pockets of his trousers. With the refrigerator and freezer doors thus operable once again, he opened the refrigerator and procured the various glass evidence tubes and the pair of tweezers.

Of course armed criminals would not likely be intimidated by the sight of a blade in hand, but Renard could never carry a firearm. On this point he was unwavering. The things were simply beneath him.

He certainly didn't need to remember his shoes, which he was still wearing, of course. Although on second thought just for safe measure he had a look at his feet. <i>Oui</i>, all right, the shoes were still on.<br><br>Renard took a last look at the apartment before stepping out the door and locking it behind him. He sidestepped the bird of paradise and strode down the hall and the two flights of stairs, aware of a greater weight and, oh how might it be put, jangliness to his person as he moved. He didn't feel burdened, however. Quite the opposite, really. It was a satisfying sensation; he felt complete, as if he had just conquered a large meal. Without all these items in his pockets he'd felt almost too light. A stiff breeze could have blown him away.<br><br>He descended into the lobby, where that perpetually smiling young <i>concierge</i> held open the door for him. "<i>Merci</i>, Waylon, <i>merci</i>," Renard said. A bit untoward perhaps that he couldn't tip the man a dollar or two, but the wallet was quite destitute and he wasn't at all sure that Waylon would appreciate being tipped one of the various glass evidence tubes. Ah well, he'd try to remember to come up with a little something when he'd return later.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">'A fine day, Mister Rouletabille - despite the weather.'<br><br>He'd pronounced Renard's name perfectly; in fact, he'd made a point to. It was the mark of a professional, and Waylon Bell was exactly that: a <i>professional</i>. No man could take that from him, though they might try. Let them play at setting him in his place; a lowly bellhop, a civil servant of his superior masters. Let them clip his paycheck and extend his hours. They would never be able to say that Waylon Bell had not <i>done his job.</i> In this he was immaculate. In this, he was perfect. <br><br>He smiled knowingly at Renard, turning the power up with his widening grin. It was a smile of pure joy, unyielding glee at the sight of one of Rotheca's many sterling tenants.  <br><br>The motion was smooth, practiced and well-oiled. The gloved hand slid over the polished brass rail and pushed, rotating the heavy door on inset hinges that glided without so much as a whisper. His body moved with the door, framing Renard on one side. His balance was low, steady. His free hand followed Renard like a shadow, floating inches from his coat as the detective moved through the Rotheca portal and into the windy grays of Winstone, ready to seize at a moment's notice should Renard take an errant step off the granite steps. Another perfect execution. Waylon flashed the million-dollar smile and let the door slide back into its frame. He resumed his post next to the door, becoming once again another piece of furniture, next to the umbrella stands and the coat racks.<br><br>Would he be more than this? Of course. Night classes at Winstone Community would net a degree in a year's time. Waylon Bell would let them play at keeping him down until then. He was not another piece of furniture. Waylon Bell would own this town one day. <br><br>The push, the hand, the smile. Another tenant passing through. A job well done. </div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">With a wave to the concierge, Renard descended the front steps and crossed around to the parking lot alongside the apartment building, where his abominable black car sat in one of the spaces.

He lowered himself gently into the driver's seat, so as not to damage any of his pocketed goods, and turned the key in the ignition. To his astonishment the car started up gracefully and he was able to back out of the space and turn out of the lot onto the street.<br><br>It was a short drive to Albarello, a mere seven and a half or eight minutes under typical traffic conditions, and Renard would have walked if he hadn't known he'd be driving elsewhere once he was done with his visit here. He carried on up Rotheca Avenue and then onto Bushmint Street, whereupon the red flourescent letters on the facade of his destination came into view. Renard pulled in and parked around behind the building next to a low, sleek silver vehicle whose make he couldn't name offhand. His was an undeniably superb brain but he hadn't devoted any of it to cultivating automobile mythology.<br><br>As he crossed the parking lot toward the building, he approached a woman with dirty blond hair who was tucking a plastic bag with the Albarello logo into her enormous blue backpack. She slung the pack over her shoulders again without a glance at him as they passed.<br><br>He frowned as the glass doors swung inward automatically to allow him entrance. Why anyone would wear a backpack into a convenience store puzzled Renard. Unless the layout inside had changed dramatically since his last visit, he doubted a stop at Albarello was likely to constitute much of an expedition. Perhaps the woman was going to spend the rest of the day hiking in the mountains to the northeast. He put the thought from his mind and entered the store.<br><br><i>Non</i>, Albarello was quite the same as ever: much too bright, shiny and clean. The glaring white lamps overhead were reflected on the polished tile floor, and cast the aisles into sharp focus. Renard passed the checkout counter and made the journey through one of the aisles (SKIN CARE - HAND LOTION - BAR SOAPS) to the back of the store. The thousands of bottles and boxes on the shelves formed a landscape of barely tolerable order and perfection on either side. At last, however, he emerged from the aisle and regarded the back wall of the store, where the pharmacy and photo counters were situated. Renard approached the photo counter immediately.<br><br>"Hello, hello," he said to the employee who was there to greet him. He held up the clipped-together stack of photographs, to which several receipts were affixed at the bottom. "I wonder if I might be able to trouble you for a refund on these photographs? You see they came out quite poorly and I don't believe I'll be able to make any use of them. This has happened on several occasions now without exception. Assured as I am of my skills with a camera, I must regrettably presume to place the blame upon this establishment..."<br><br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler7335303').toggle();if($('#spoiler7335303').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler7335303"><i>OOC: Albarello is a fictitious pharmacy/grocery/photo lab chain along the lines of CVS, Walgreens, etc. I could use someone to RP an employee at the photo desk.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Tom had seen the Frenchman's familiar face at the photo counter and moved from his pharmacy station to wait on him since the usual staff of two startlingly inept teenage girls had retreated into the darkroom as soon as they saw Renard emerge from the cosmetics aisle. They hated dealing with his requests for a refund, partly because the task actually required thought to perform but Tom knew a large part of it was that they simply didn't understand the man. Renard's accent and penchant for the grandiloquent often led to his intentions being buried deep in their midst. Tom enjoyed Renard's affectations though and greeted him with a smile while he listened to Renard's roundabout way of telling Tom that the store sucks and he wants his money back.<br><br>"Good to see you again Mr. Renard! I'm terribly sorry that your photos didn't turn out as you'd hoped; I'll get that return done for you right now." Tom wasn't actually sure if Renard was his first or last name as Renard simply referred to himself as Renard. He attached the title anyways so as not to offend the man's sensibilities. He opened the register after a perfunctory glance at Renard's receipts. In all his visits, he'd never neglected to bring the necessary paperwork.<br><br>"Here's the twenty-six thirty-six for your return and I'd like to apologize once again for the substandard performance. If there's anything else I can do for you, sir, I'd be happy to oblige."</div></div>

It was going to ruin his whole day. It didn't help that he had to stand in the Soap aisles, haggard and unshaven, dressed for range work in heavy cargo pants and a weatherproof Magellan.

Someone was coming his way. Huckabee shoved his hands in his pockets and withdrew a cell phone, hurriedly flicking it open and placing it to his ear, turning his face away from the stranger. It was a reflex of embarrassment - God forbid he should make eye contact, give away his defenses and show this passerby that he might be some fruit-salad flutist.<br><br>The man rushed by, oblivious. He looked even stranger than Daniel, clutching what looked like photos of photocopied oil slicks in his hands. He sighed with relief. At least he wasn't the only kook here. He turned back to the rack of indecipherable potions.<br><br>'Ah, <i>hell with it</i>. Orange Blossom Special will have to do. All smells the same.' He grabbed the neon bottle from the rack and hurried to the counter, where he wound up behind the same nutcase from before. He stared at the neon gay-juice in his hands, feeling his frustration rise. 'Can't a guy just <i>pay</i>...' he whispered under his breath.<br><br>The nutcase was getting a refund. How could you refund pictures? Aren't they -yours-? If they're screwed up, then it was your fault, wasn't it? Daniel had taken thousands of surveillance pictures, and he knew when he'd screwed up a shot.<br><br>This was taking forever.

Renard plucked them off the vinyl surface hurriedly, aware that there was a fellow behind him in line.

"<i>Pardonnez-moi, monsieur! Je vous prie.</i>"<br><br>He winced. He didn't like dropping into French around complete strangers but it happened on occasion when he lost his nerve. Of course there was really no need to lose his nerve in this situation which contributed to his general feeling of being an oaf.

Was it even possible for shampoo to accomplish that? Renard couldn't be certain. He was not in the practice of dyeing his hair.

Even if they were indecipherable they had to be destroyed as per the store's privacy policy. He fed them in one by one until he came upon one that was much clearer than the others. It was the last in the stack and Tom could easily see a man in a large coat and an old-fashioned hat. The picture was taken from behind so the face wasn't visible but his shadow was cast on the wall in front of him in such a way that it was quite obvious he was examining something in his hand, possibly a pocketwatch. It certainly looked like there was a chain attached to it.<br><br>Tom thought that the man looked an awful lot like Renard but the Frenchman had never before submitted a self-portrait before or anything that could be considered artistic, unless you counted poorly composed photos with even poorer exposure and focus. Though he worked in the pharmacy, Tom was an amateur photographer in his spare time. This photograph was of a markedly better quality than anything Renard had ever dropped in the bin.<br><br>Tom held on to the photo and into the darkroom where they kept the negatives in limbo in case the customers decided they wanted additional photos developed. As Tom opened the door the ditzes inside stopped their conversation and left the room before the door closed behind him. Opening one of the file cabinets, Tom parsed the tabs until he came to the Rs. He found Renard's file and noted that someone had tried to take down his last name but scratched through it in frustration and simply scrawled "Ruhnarde" on the envelope. Tom emptied the negatives onto a clean sheet of tissue paper and began holding them up towards the dim red bulb hoping to find the roll containing Renard's abnormally passable shot so he could see if there were perhaps others that he could salvage for the eccentric customer.<br><br>After he'd twice gone through all of the negatives and hadn't found the frame Tom slumped against the wall to rest. <br><br><i>I guess Renard returned one of his personal photos by accident.

He finished going through the coat and moved on to his pants pockets. The rolled-up newspaper wasn't there. He looked over onto the seat beside him. The rolled-up newspaper also wasn't there. It was possible he hadn't thought to bring the rolled-up newspaper. It was, further, possible that he had never even rolled the newspaper back up and that it was still lying flat on the rocking chair back at the apartment.<br><br><i>Zut</i>. He could have done with a reminder of the details. He hadn't properly committed the contents of the paper to memory yet.

And it had been a painting of... oh, some fellow from the old stories. One of the Metamorphoses, but... <i>Tonnerre de Brest,</i> he was out of his depth here. He stared at the cars parading past on Bushmint Street and pressed a hand to a temple. If he had only lingered at the apartment long enough to internalize the latest edition of the Winstone Post, he would not now be having this problem.<br><br>But let it never go into the history books that Renard Rouletabille was a man easily ruffled by such a trifling setback. He didn't <i>need</i> the newspaper anymore. He had the freedom to proceed directly to the heart of the matter. The Winstone Gallery of Art was no more than twenty-two or twenty-three minutes away.

Huh? That's gotta be it, right?"<br><br>Inspector Landsvale only shook his head somberly. Commissioner Williams grimaced. This guy was hell to work with. Couldn't give an encouraging answer to anything. Always had to be negative. "Come on," Williams said. "That's perfect. And we <i>know</i> there are Powers like that out there."<br><br>The blue-clad Inspector finally spoke. "Yeah, we know there are Powers who can become both invisible and intangible. I'm not, listen, I'm not arguing that. But just think about it, okay? How could someone intangible pick up the painting? They'd need to get tangible again, if only at their hands. Right? Otherwise they couldn't exert any force on the painting."<br><br>"So what?"<br><br>Landsvale's baggy eyes fell on Williams. "So what happens when the lasers notice there are a few stray fingers hovering around <i>Le roi Midas</i> that weren't there a second ago?"<br><br>Williams clenched a fist and let out an aggravated huff, which was his way of saying "Why yes, you're right actually." Denham Landsvale might have been a walking exercise in depression but at least he caught the little details. That was about the only thing that made working with him tolerable for Williams, but what was he supposed to do. It'd only been about a week since his best subordinate and six lesser officers had gone after a couple of renegade Powers and ended up needing to be dug out of a frozen city block piece by piece. Okay, maybe not the most respectable way to put it but Williams knew Davidson wouldn't've cared. Seth Davidson... <i>He'd</i> been a real cop, a guy who could take charge in a crisis. A guy who didn't need someone to hold his hand as he worked through his fucking self-esteem issues or alcoholism or whatever was Landsvale's problem.<br><br>The funeral had been last weekend. He and Monica had decided to leave the kids with a babysitter. Not like it was an open-coffin deal or anything obviously, god, no. Even so. They were still young. Passing away gracefully in a hospital amid family, sure, okay, but the kids didn't yet need to know shit like <i>that</i> happened.<br><br>And then, of course, on top of that and the d'Arcangel's attack and the colossal humiliating fuckup that was the Hotel Ansonia incident, since Williams <i>clearly</i> wasn't already wading through a deep enough river of factory-processed hog feces courtesy of every goddamn Power between here and Whelkshore, now he had a missing painting to deal with.<br><br>He scrutinized the empty space on the gallery wall again, as if hoping that a new clue was suddenly going to emerge from beyond the plaster. He still knew a Power had to be behind this. How was a normal human being supposed to pull off this kinda stunt? But they'd combed through every file they had on every local Power who'd ever run afoul of the law, the whole freakshow. No clear suspects. There were telekinetes who could have moved the painting from a distance, but it hadn't moved away, it had simply disappeared. There were technopaths who could have disabled the laser systems and rewritten the camera output, but they'd've needed to get into the control room first, and by then they'd already have been caught.<br><br>And for every Power he read about who looked even remotely promising, he had to ask himself: why just <i>that</i> painting? If they could have whisked one piece away with some black magic, why not all of them? How could he explain the thief's self-restraint?<br><br>"Commissioner."<br><br>Williams realized he had been staring at the same patch of wall the whole time. He jerked his gaze away and looked at Landsvale, who was pointing off toward the roped-off border around the area of the missing painting. A hangdog figure with a bulging coat, a broom-like shock of dark hair, and a pipe was standing there expectantly.<br><br>Oh god. It was Rouletabille.<br><br>Williams somehow managed to resist the urge to just smash his head through the empty space on the wall and turn himself into the Winstone Gallery of Art's latest acquisition.

Alas they did nothing of the sort.<br><br>"Yeah. Afternoon, Rouletabille. How can I help you?" The Commissioner drew closer, no doubt knowingly permitting his superior height and girth to factor into the conversation. "What can I do for you instead of working on this case? No no, take your time, I've got all day."<br><br>Renard had been attempting to speak up at intervals throughout this little speech, which therefore made the Commissioner's encouragement to take his time rather confusing. However, he swiftly recovered from this loss of conversational balance and started back in. "You're too generous, Commissioner. I understand a painting has been, ah, discreetly removed from this gallery, <i>n'est-ce pas</i>? And you're in something of a bind puzzling out how the deed was done?"<br><br>"We're not hiring, Rouletabille." The Commissioner's arms folded in front of his considerable chest. "We've got transfers moving in onto the squad tomorrow. We'll be back at full capacity. In the meantime we do <i>not</i> need your assistance."<br><br>"Oh! -- <i>excusez-moi</i>, no, no! I don't mean to force my presence upon you, no!" Renard remembered quite well his brief stint attempting to work directly with the Winstone police force, the least disastrous consequence of which was that several perfectly serviceable uniforms had ended up doused with bubble juice. "A word and I shall be gone. I only hope to gather information for my own investigation into this matter. Perhaps I can help you without... ah, actually giving you my help, <i>oui</i>?"<br><br>The Commissioner looked unmollified. Renard pressed on, remembering what he had read in the obituaries within the past week. "After all I should hardly dare to presume to work directly with you on this case. It would be an insult to the departed Inspector Davidson and the other brave officers who tragically--"<br><br>"Stop, stop. Jesus <i>Christ</i>." The Commissioner rubbed an ear, dropping his gaze to the floor. He appeared to be considering the situation. "God, this is embarrassing. Fine. Gather information, I don't care. You figure out who's behind this, well, more power to you."<br><br>The word "power" caught Renard's ear. He suddenly felt like orchestrating a very sly and fluid subject change. "That's the sort of person you expect is the culprit, isn't it? A Power?"<br><br>"Yeah. Well. Who else? Not that we're looking at any real leads yet.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"No, no, no, no, <i>no</i>! This simply will not do!"<br><br>The loud voice was emanating from somewhere nearby and echoing impressively despite the fact that there should not be any such echo. Perhaps the speaker was repeating the word far too much. Clearly he was upset about something, and it did not take a genius to figure out what. Every member of staff so far had been the unwilling recipient of the Curator's Wrath. It was not even remotely an enjoyable experience.<br><br>The Curator was a moderately portly man which was only emphasized by his rather short figure. He had, sadly, acquired the basic appearence of a fire hydrant. His hair was styled in an attempt to cover his rapidly receeding hairline, as much of it pulled forward and hairsprayed in place as possible, giving him an unusual kind of plumage. Unlike many of the other people present, he was wearing a bright, flamboyant sky blue suit with matching tie and white shirt. Despite his plastic surgery attempts, his skin was still infuriatingly wrinkled. Stress, he put it down to. The stress of the job.<br><br>Which had gotten even more stressful overnight, apparently! One of the Bon Boullogne paintings had simply vanished! Gone, without a trace! And the police were useless! Not a single lead! What was he paying them for? Actually, was he paying them? Was that the issue? Did he have to give them an extra bonus in order for his painting to reappear? Outrageous! No, he would not succumb to the wishes of the law this time. If those men wanted to keep their jobs, they would find the painting immediately or suffer the Curator's Wrath!<br><br>"Nothing at all? Don't bring me a report if the report has no content! This is an outrage! A scandal!"<br><br>The man was bouncing around the museum angrily, nearly smashing glass cases and expensive ornaments on display in his fury. His personal assistant followed quickly, ready to stop anything from falling if the need arose. The curator may have scoffed, if he had known. Break any of his precious displays? Nonsense. Preposterous. The thought should be taken outside and shot. Twice. With the security DVD in hand, he was making his way to the investigation.<br><br>"Mister Wood, the investigation team is waiting..." His assistant began, but the Curator quickly cut her off.<br><br>"I know they are waiting, but they can wait a little longer! If they expect a bonus at the end of this, they will be most disappointed!" He snapped back, several diamonds glittering from his teeth. People thought he was being silly, getting them encrusted into his teeth, but that bit of extra shine was simply divine.<br><br>The Curator was stopped dead in his tracks when he saw the investigation team, apparently doing nothing.<br><br>"No, no, no! What are you people doing?!" He demanded, waving the disc around carelessly. "This is an investigation, not a mothers meeting! I need results, now!"</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Mr. Wood -- come on, now, Mr. Wood, take it easy--" Commissioner Williams stepped heavily over the rope and lumbered over to the rather stocky apparent curator who had just appeared on the scene. The Commissioner was reaching out a hand to accept the peculiar metallic disk that glinted in the curator's palm with many colors under the harsh light. Renard overheard the Commissioner saying, in a lower voice, something like "Want to just hand that over and then we'll..."<br><br>Now left standing rather awkwardly at the rope, Renard posed a question to the other policeman, the weary-faced one dressed in the blue uniform. "May I ask if you know what that is?" he said, pointing to the gleaming disk.<br><br>The other policeman didn't need to follow Renard's finger to answer. "Security footage from the other day," he responded. "Williams'll want me to go through the whole thing, see if anyone acted weird around the Boullogne."<br><br>This did not precisely answer Renard's question, as he had no idea how an entire roll of camera footage could be squeezed onto a tiny flattened disk like that one. Nonetheless he decided not to press too far upon the point. His keen instincts told him that the exact nature of this object was something that everyone else in the room took for granted and that he would incur an undesirable social stumble to ask how it worked.<br><div class="quote" author="@ninety" source="/post/53577/thread" timestamp="1270925615"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-66" title="Ninety"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/y5MlxQ8.jpg" alt="Ninety Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/53577/thread"><abbr title="Apr 10, 2010 8:53:35 GMT -5" class="o-timestamp time" data-timestamp="1270925615000">Apr 10, 2010 8:53:35 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/66" class="user-link user-66 group-0" itemprop="url" title="@ninety"><span itemprop="name">Ninety</span></a></span> said:</div>Remember that you're at the crime scene and begin canvassing the area.<div class="quote_clear"></div></div></div><div class="quote" author="@ninety" source="/post/53577/thread" timestamp="1270925615"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-66" title="Ninety"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/y5MlxQ8.jpg" alt="Ninety Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/53577/thread"><abbr title="Apr 10, 2010 8:53:35 GMT -5" class="o-timestamp time" data-timestamp="1270925615000">Apr 10, 2010 8:53:35 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/66" class="user-link user-66 group-0" itemprop="url" title="@ninety"><span itemprop="name">Ninety</span></a></span> said:</div>Use magnifying glass to examine the spot where the painting was.

"You don't think I could, ah...?" he said hopefully to the other policeman, who looked him over for a moment before nodding.<br><br>"Why not."<br><br>"<i>Merci, merci.</i>" Renard gently swung a leg over the rope, trying not to upset any of the contents of his coat as he did so. He hurried to the spot where the Boullogne had been hung and pulled the magnifying glass from one of the outer pockets of the coat. Holding it up before an acute eye, he scrutinized the empty space on the wall. With his free hand he felt around in the same outer coat pocket. He was certain that he'd come upon the tweezers when he'd been trying to procure the magnifying glass. Ah yes, there they were. He would require them and the glass tubes in case he needed to pluck any innocuous scrap of potential evidence off the plaster surface.<br><br><hr><font face="Palatino"><font size="4">Bon Boullogne<br><b><i>Le roi Midas (King Midas)</i></b>, 1693<br>Oil on canvas</font></font><hr><br>That would have worked out superbly if there were some innocuous scrap of potential evidence to find. But he saw nothing. Only the nail where the painting had been hung, and the plaque carrying the description he had just read, marred the otherwise smooth and clean wall. Renard held the magnifying glass up to the nail and scrutinized it intensely. If there were some sign of damage to this little pin of iron... Say, perhaps, it was cocked slightly downward. This might have indicated that the painting had been roughly wrenched down off the wall by someone of short and stout stature. Someone such as, possibly, the curator? <i>Mais oui</i>, but of course, he might have stolen the Boullogne himself in an effort to drum up sympathy and publicity for his failing gallery. There would have been, perhaps, a donation of a new piece to hang in the Boullogne's place, and meanwhile the curator would have been able to discreetly sell <i>Le roi Midas</i> at a substantial profit. <i>Parfait</i>. A brilliant solution.<br><br>Only the nail wasn't warped. And the plaster around it was not distended. Whoever had removed this painting had been free to do so with a minimum of physical fuss.<br><br>"Not really looking forward to it," the other policeman said. Renard blinked before realizing that he was talking about reviewing the security footage again. "Take up the whole afternoon. Watch a bunch of people picking their nose."<br><br>The man sounded bored by the prospect. Renard couldn't imagine why. He was terribly intrigued by the little disk and how one was to go about extracting information from it. But, not wishing to irk the policeman who had graciously allowed him into the roped-off area, he simply said, "Mm, yes, quite."<br><br>After dropping the magnifying glass back into the outer coat pocket with the tweezers, Renard retrieved the box of fingerprint powder from the left pocket of his trousers. He opened it and unclipped the small brush and roll of cellophane tape from the underside of the lid. Even if there were no visible traces of a theft, he must assuredly be able to uncover fingerprints. He shook the brush to spread the bristles, lightly dipped it into the powder and then ran it across the surface of the wall. He powdered around the entire surface area where the painting had hung. When he was finished, he unrolled strips of cellophane tape and pressed them onto the wall. Then, with a series of swift and graceful motions, he tore each strip of tape back off the wall.<br><br>The powder was completely uninterrupted. Not a single fingerprint had been rendered visible.<br><br>"Still, someone's got to do it. And it's not like I can just tell the Commissioner to sit his own ass down and watch the DVD himself."<br><br>"Mm, quite, yes."<br><br>Renard stepped back from the wall and looked it up and down again, his brow furrowed. How could he have failed to find a thing? Might the burglar truly have evacuated the Boullogne <i>sans une trace</i>?<br><br>He tweaked his moustache in thought.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"No, I will not 'take it easy', Williams!" The Curator barked back at the man, who was rather rudely entering the important man's personal bubble.

"Please do as he says, or we'll be here all day."<br><br>The Curator had acquired the security disc to give to the investigation team, but not before he gave them a rather hefty piece of his mind.<br><br>"Since you're still here, you clearly haven't figured out who has stolen the Le roi Midas," the Curator deduced, using a ridiculous accent on the painting's name.

If you don't have something conclusive to show me within the next twenty four hours, there will be <i>hell</i> to pay!"<br><br>He promptly thrust the DVD into Commissioner Williams' palm and stormed off.<br><br>His personal assistant took the sheet of paper from the clip board and handed it to the Commissioner.<br><br>"A letter of apology on behalf of Mister Wood.

He'd been pretty hard-pressed not to just take the DVD and stuff it down the little asshole's gullet. Unfortunately Williams didn't really think he'd be able to swing any kind of legal defense for bashing someone's face in when the victim was a greasy, chubby, altogether feeble pipsqueak half his height.<br><br>The <i>balls</i> these people had, though. Could use a little fucking patience. One look at the badge and they thought everything was going to get wrapped up in a nice half-hour package with time for commercials. No appreciation for the fact that this crime was totally unprecedented in Williams' experience. God, no. Perish the thought. Fat chance someone like the curator could <i>possibly</i> shut his mouth long enough to come to terms with the difficulty Williams and his team were going to have in tracking down whatever goddamn sociopathic Power was behind--<br><br>A sneeze. Williams whipped around. Rouletabille was standing in the roped-off area, in front of the painting, wiping his eyes profusely with one hand while holding a little box in the other. He coughed. There was white powder all over his face and hair. Cocaine if Williams was lucky. Anthrax if he wasn't.<br><br>"What the hell," Williams said levelly to Landsvale, "brought this on? Who let this happen?" He gestured at the bleary-eyed Frenchman. "Don't tell me you let this happen, Landsvale."<br><br>The Inspector shrugged. "He wanted to check it out. Didn't think it was worth telling him no."<br><br>Williams snorted in a concise effort to demonstrate his contempt for Inspector Landsvale's backbone. The Frenchman was a pushover. "Rouletabille. Out." To his satisfaction, Rouletabille quickly squirrelled the little box back into a pocket and hurried over the nearest rope. You just had to take a harsh tone with him. And Williams had quite a bit of harsh tone saved up after that little chat with the curator. In fact Williams decided to uncork a little more of the fury on Rouletabille for good measure. Jabbing a finger at the man's scrawny chest, he went on, "In fact, you're lucky I don't have you brought in for sabotaging the investigation."<br><br>"Need to wipe that off?"<br><br>"Oh, <i>merci beaucoup</i>, Mr. Landsvale."<br><br>The Inspector's navy-blue handkerchief passed from his own hand to Rouletabille's. The Frenchman set about mopping the powder off his face. Williams glared at Landsvale before continuing. "So maybe you can do me a favor and piss off? Go screw up someone else's job. Give us a break for..." He trailed off. After reappearing from behind the handkerchief, Rouletabille's eyes had settled on the DVD in Williams' hand.<br><br>"Actually," Rouletabille said, "I wonder if perhaps I could... help you at a distance by analyzing... That is, perhaps by analyzing the footage which you hold there..."<br><br>Williams was about to cut him off when Inspector Landsvale piped up. "That is a <i>great</i> idea," he said. "Commissioner, whyn't you just give this guy the DVD, let him go through the film? Save us all some time and effort. So we can deal with the real work."<br><br>Rouletabille nodded eagerly as he gave Landsvale's handkerchief back.<br><br>Commissioner Williams thought about it. He clearly didn't owe Rouletabille any favors. And he <i>definitely</i> wouldn't entrust a serious task like this to Rouletabille alone... But at the same time, it would get the Frenchman off his back. If it meant he'd feel important enough not to irritate Williams further, then that was a plus.<br><br>He drew a breath. "Okay," he said. "Okay. Fine. Here you go. I guess we could use another pair of eyes on this one."<br><br>He handed the DVD to Rouletabille, who beamed as he turned it over in his fingers, letting the light reflect off the surface. The Inspector smiled too, for the first time in a while. Good. He'd taken the bait. Williams let the sentimentality pile up for another instant before pouncing. "I said <i>another</i> pair of eyes, Landsvale. How about you go find the curator and have him pop out another copy? Between you and Rouletabille, you guys'll catch <i>everything</i> on here."<br><br>The Inspector's face drooped back down to its ordinary posture. He started toward the doorway through which the curator and his assistant had disappeared, but stopped at the sight of Rouletabille's bony outstretched hand.<br><br>"Thank you again, Mr. Landsvale. My name is Renard Rouletabille. I hope very much that today our parallel searches will yield bountiful fruit!"<br><br>They shook hands. "Denham Landsvale," he said. "Yeah, nice to meet you, Rouletabille. Take it easy."<br><br>So he trudged out of the wing.<br><br>"Commissioner, let me thank you even more emphatically," Rouletabille said, rounding on Williams. "You've done me a great honor. I am, <i>franchement</i>, touched. Please know that I shall attend to this responsibility with a dedication that will, if I may, make anyone on the Winstone police force proud. This--"<br><br>"Yeah, yeah," Williams grunted. "You enjoy yourself. And -- listen--" He leaned in and spoke to Rouletabille in a lower voice. "If you see anyone doing anything <i>weird</i> on camera -- anyone who's got glowing eyes or, or who's making little fireballs in their hands or something... That's priority number one. You call the station and let us know <i>immediately</i>, got it?"<br><br>"<i>Je comprends.</i>"<br><br>"Good." Williams straightened up. "Get going, then."<br><br>Rouletabille bounded out of the wing through the other doorway, which led toward the lobby. "<i>Merci beaucoup,</i> Commissioner! <i>Au revoir</i>!"<br><br>Commissioner Williams shook his head and looked back at the empty space on the wall where the Boullogne had hung. Guy was an unmitigated fruitcake. That was a comfortable stance to take and Williams felt distinctly uneasy about the prospect of having to revise that opinion on the off chance that Rouletabille might actually make himself useful today. But what the hell, if it happened, it happened.<br><br>* * *<br><br>Clutching the colorful metallic disk tenderly with his fingertips, Renard emerged in the lobby, a round room mostly empty save for the ring of columns at the center. He looked around. The front desk was unattended. Beside it stood a donation box, a stand with some brochures about the exhibits, and a shorter pedestal that held up the visitor's log.</div></div>

He conjured no one. Possibly the woman who had been assisting the curator earlier was meant to be here to receive visitors but if so she remained otherwise occupied. He rang the bell again. It was quite an enjoyable little sound actually. No one appeared.<br><br>As he waited for an employee to emerge from a doorway and hurry behind the desk with profuse apologies, his eyes wandered. There was a large mechanical box sitting on the desk. <i>Ah oui.</i> A computer. Renard had seen and heard enough of these things to understand by now their name. He admired the device, with its smooth glass screen beyond which showed only black. A keyboard sat in front of the computer, its letters arranged in a way that looked familiar to Renard; this was the layout of a typewriter as well, although there were buttons here with names he assuredly did not recognize. He had no idea for instance what an "alt" might be.<br><br>Renard held up the metallic disk. One thing of which he was absolutely certain was that this disk was in some way compatible with computers. Yes, yes, that was right: one simply had to put the disk into the computer to bring up whatever information the disk held. Renard congratulated himself: <i>veritablement</i>, he had his finger squarely on the pulse of modern technology. He ushered himself behind the desk and regarded the entire contraption. The box with the screen, the keyboard, and the little -- ah yes, the "mouse", all were wired to a rectangular box underneath the desk. But surely the box with the screen was the computer, <i>non</i>? Renard groped around behind the computer with his free hand, hoping that the correct place to insert the disk would suggest itself naturally. It did no such thing. Renard looked down at the box under the desk. Perhaps the disk was supposed to go in there? Renard honestly could not say.<br><div class="quote" source="/post/53669/thread" timestamp="1271267915" author="@evilbiscuit"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-85" title="The Evil Biscuit"><img src="http://i153.photobucket.com/albums/s217/evilbiscuit/kaiseravatar-1.jpg" alt="The Evil Biscuit Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/53669/thread"><abbr data-timestamp="1271267915000" class="o-timestamp time" title="Apr 14, 2010 7:58:35 GMT -5">Apr 14, 2010 7:58:35 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/85" class="user-link user-85 group-11" itemprop="url" title="@evilbiscuit"><span itemprop="name">The Evil Biscuit</span></a></span> said:</div>Realize you have no idea how a DVD works.<div class="quote_clear"></div></div></div><br>Well, this was coming along poorly so far. Renard looked again over the entire setup. Something seemed not quite right to him. Weren't there... Weren't there supposed to be more blinking lights?<br><br>Oh, he was sure of that. When a computer was in operation, lights would blink everywhere. Yet this computer was completely darkened. Nor did it produce any humming or whirring sounds of the kind he expected such a device to make. Why, the computer was turned off. He would need to activate it before he could insert the disk. But there were so many buttons! How could he know which one to press? A tremble of trepidation ran up Renard's spine. He had a very strong feeling that if he were to push the wrong button, the whole thing might easily go up in his face like a landmine.<br><br><i>C'etait futile.</i> The computer was too alarming.

He read the entry again, disbelief coming up sharply against this new piece of information.<br><br>Surely he couldn't have just picked up a lead on <i>Madame Mangjeol?</i><br><br><i>Non.</i> Absolutely not. Renard shook himself mentally; he was being an ass. He could think of at least five reasons off the top of his head why he knew Mme. Mangjeol could not have stolen the Boullogne. He whipped out his notebook and one of the two pens. After swiftly jotting down several broad observations from his encounter with Williams and the curator, Renard created a five-point list.<br><blockquote><font size="5"><font face="Brush">______________________________<br>____<u>Albarello:</u>____________________<br>_____<u>Suspicious individual at checkout</u>____<br>_<u>Mid-forties? fifties? Greying blonde</u>______<br>___<u>spectacles. beaked nose.</u>____________<br>______<u>Purchase: Orange Blossom Special</u>_<br>_____<u>impatient, brusque demeanor</u>_______<br>__<u><font size="4">INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS GAZE!!</font></u>______<br>___<u>Possible something to hide?</u>__________<br>________<u>owner of sleek silver vehicle?</u>____<br>_<u>Winstone Gallery of Art:</u>____________<br>____<u>no evidence of burglary! fingerprints &amp;c.</u><br>_____<u>Landsvale (new inspector)</u>________</font></font></blockquote>[/font][/blockquote]<blockquote><font size="5"><font face="Brush">______________________________<br>__<u>Enraged curator covering something?</u>_____<br>___<u>review security footage for Williams</u>____<br>__<u><font size="4">MME. MANGJEOL'S NAME IN LOG!</font></u>______<br><u>Reasons why doubtful -</u>_______________<br><u>1.</u>_____________________________<br><u>2.</u>_____________________________<br><u>3.</u>_____________________________<br><u>4.</u>_____________________________<br><u>5.</u>_____________________________<br>______________________________<br>______________________________<br>______________________________</font></font></blockquote>[/font][/blockquote]<br>The first reason why it was obvious to Renard that Mme. Mangjeol could not be responsible was that she was<br><blockquote><font size="5"><font face="Brush">______________________________<br><u>1. very intelligent</u>___________________</font></font></blockquote>[/font][/blockquote]<br>although really it would be enough in this case to say that she possessed two brain cells, as only someone with fewer would sign the visitor's log of a museum she was planning to rob. Even more pointedly, Mme. Mangjeol was also much too<br><blockquote><font size="5"><font face="Brush">______________________________<br><u>2. well-known (famous/infamous)</u>________</font></font></blockquote>[/font][/blockquote]<br>to do something like this. Hers was a name recognized throughout the Archipelago and particularly to <i>everyone</i> in the underbelly of Winstone -- including the Commissioner and the rest of the police force. For her to get the idea that she could waltz off with a valuable painting and escape unaccused was laughable. Indeed, the fact that she had signed the visitors' log proved not only that she herself was not responsible but also that she must not have had even the faintest notion that a burglary was imminent. Otherwise she would not have dared allow her name to become involved. For she also happened to be<br><blockquote><font size="5"><font face="Brush">______________________________<br><u>3. exceedingly cautious.</u>______________</font></font></blockquote>[/font][/blockquote]<br>Those three points formed the crux of Renard's argument, but since another two had also leaped to mind, he supposed it couldn't hurt to write them down as well even though he could not honestly say he was as certain of these final two points as of the first three. Even so it bore mentioning that Mme. Mangjeol was, as far as he knew, still<br><blockquote><font size="5"><font face="Brush">______________________________<br><u>4. as wealthy as ever</u>________________</font></font></blockquote>[/font][/blockquote]<br>in which case it was quite silly to imagine her making a nocturnal bid for a well-secured bit of portraiture. Mme. Mangjeol was a highly sought-after and relied-upon informant. He had no reason to suspect the profits from her business might have somehow come crashing down to such an extent that she would need to resort to this kind of activity. Finally, there remained the distinct and (one assumed) immutable fact that Mme. Mangjeol was<br><blockquote><font size="5"><font face="Brush">______________________________<br><u>5. not a Power.</u>____________________</font></font></blockquote>[/font][/blockquote]<br>And if Renard was to agree with the Commissioner on any point regarding this crime, it was that a Power had to be the culprit. Renard saw no way around that assessment.<br><br>Even so. The fact that Yoon Mangjeol had been here within twenty-four hours of the burglary was a highly intriguing piece of news. Renard was tempted to drive to the Passione Rossa and seek her out immediately. He changed his mind only after he remembered that it was generally preferable not to speak with Mme. Mangjeol until one knew what one was going to talk about. Better to watch the recording first. Then, if he noticed anyone behaving oddly, he could go on to inquire of Mme. Mangjeol whether she knew anything about the suspect.<br><br>For good measure, though, Renard glanced around the lobby to ensure that no one was watching and then tore the page bearing Mme. Mangjeol's entry out of the visitor's log. He folded it up and tucked it back in with the notebook and the pen.<br><br>Then he rather quickly made his way out of the Winstone Gallery of Art, down the granite steps and onto the noisy street, where his car was parked. He was thinking very carefully about what his next move should be. There were places where he knew public computers to be available, such as the library, but he was still fearful of the prospect of trying to operate one by himself. <i>Beaucoup trop difficile.</i> Easier it seemed to him to locate someone with a computer of their own and ask for their help. Renard was perceptive enough to have noticed that not all things billed as "computers" were the same as the large, heavy contraption he had faced back in the gallery. There were people who owned smaller, folding machines you could carry in the crook of an arm. Renard pondered where to find such people. He'd seen them cropping up repeatedly in certain kinds of establishments. He had an idea that the phrase "FREE WI-FI" was somehow involved because it was commonly printed in large, eye-catching letters on the windows of the businesses where he most often spied people with small folding computers.<br><br><br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler7081713').toggle();if($('#spoiler7081713').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler7081713"><i>OOC: As a reminder, Yoon Mangjeol made her debut <a rel="nofollow" href="http://archipelagoexodus.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=ish&amp;action=display&amp;thread=2430" target="_blank">here</a>, in the cutscene before Scene Two.

He wouldn't even need to drive. He stopped by the car only to retrieve the massive black-and-white-striped umbrella. Then, after ensuring that the driver's door was locked, he set off down the sidewalk, leaving the car on the street in front of the Gallery.<br><br>The umbrella seemed a wise companion on this pedestrian jaunt through Winstone. There was a light sprinkle coming down from the adamantly dense and gray clouds overhead, and Renard suspected that would not be all the weather had to say today. Should a proper thunderstorm break out he wished to be prepared, even despite the brief duration of this stroll. <i>En fait</i> upon further reflection he decided to open the umbrella now, even while precipitation remained only the faintest of drizzles. The great black-and-white canvas blossomed and Renard held it over his head with both hands. Those passing by through the puddles on the sidewalk gave him a wide berth. He couldn't blame them. This umbrella really was enormous. Renard imagined he could accommodate an entire battalion of the Chasseurs Alpins under here.<br><br>He tilted the umbrella up enough to watch the people walking by. Although a few of them had sidelong glances to spare for the great dome over his head or for his attire, no one seemed interested in making eye contact. They bustled past with their eyes on the increasingly-sopping ground, for the most part. Exasperation, anger, despondency and worry circulated around him; perhaps guilt, too, intermingled with the crowd? Was the burglar close at hand, hidden in plain sight? Renard supposed, as he stepped down off the corner onto the crosswalk, that it might be unfair to expect the thief to reappear within a mile of the Gallery...<br><br>The painting he sought appeared before him, not the one he was seeking in the overall sense but the one he had been seeking most immediately: the steaming mug painted onto the sign over Demitasse. A welcome sight! This was one of Renard's best-loved places in the city, a little French flower in this vast Italian garden. After collapsing the umbrella, he pulled open the door.<br><br>At once the familiar mixture of aromas swept around and beckoned him inside. Vanilla, chocolate, hazelnut, caramel, almonds, cinnamon, even cherries and peppermint: all formed an olfactory orchestra whose symphony delighted the nose. Demitasse was a cozy retreat against whose spare brick wall space were squeezed great wooden black bookshelves. The close-set tables and chairs, taller than they were wide, could afford only one aisle of passage to the counter. Renard performed a quick assessment of the customers huddled in with their drinks. <i>Certes</i>, here and there were open computers, small shrines of promise guarded by elbows and half-empty cups. He compared their owners, trying to decide whom to approach first.<br><br>To buy some time, he moved into line. He would order the usual. Renard Rouletabille was not opposed to trying new things but he was also a man who valued his habits, and Demitasse was one of the most prized of all. What a humble paradise!<br><br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler8687904').toggle();if($('#spoiler8687904').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler8687904"><i>OOC: Here is an</i> ideal <i>opportunity for an already-established character to nab a cameo in this RP.

He set the plate with the half-eaten croissant down as tentatively and noncommittally as possible on the very far edge of her round table so that he could retrieve the colorful metallic disk from a pocket. "I wonder if I might persuade you to show me how to combine this item with a machine such as yours in an effort to... to release whatever information lies therein or -- or thereupon, or..." He faltered, looking down at the disk in his hand. He really had no idea how to express the spatial relationship between this disk and the footage it was supposed to contain.</div></div>

Renard had never properly learned the difference. However the disk was quite rigid and unyielding so after an instant of deliberation he chose the more appropriate-sounding alternative) "--hardware which was just entrusted to me by the curator of the Gallery of Art. I highly doubt he would have knowingly tampered with this material, for <i>tu vois</i> it was originally to have been placed in the hands of the police. The curator would have necessarily feared retribution and possibly imprisonment if he had presented Commissioner Williams with a gift which would have, as you said... contaminated him or..."<br><br>Well! He might have lost a bit of steam at the end there but even so Renard believed he had just strung together a rather elegant argument for the integrity and purity of the rainbow-colored metallic disk. No doubt the blue-haired young woman had been equally impressed by his deductive reasoning. He took the liberty of hoisting himself up, overstuffed coat and all, onto the high chair opposite her own. The various glass evidence tubes tinkled in protest.<br><br>"<i>Permettez-moi expliquer.</i> I am investigating the matter of the Baroque painting by Bon Boullogne which disappeared from the Gallery two nights ago.

He paused for breath, noticed that there was an element to his story he'd forgotten, and quickly added it. "Additionally, my name is Renard Rouletabille."<br><br>After transferring the disk to his left hand, he reached the right hand out to shake hers. Then he noticed that the baggy end of his sleeve was perilously close to dipping into the lady's beverage.

And <i>en verite</i> Renard didn't really know anything about the seedier parts of town anyway. He was simply glad, above all else, that he and Mlle. Garrelcette had properly met and that she was being so cooperative. This was something of a surprise to tell the truth.<br><br>He sipped from his Cafe Noisette and considered her question. It wasn't particularly difficult to arrive at an answer based upon the conditions of his search. There was one individual whom he knew to have been here at the Gallery on this day. Why, he still had the torn-out page from the visitor's log to prove it. The best way to start ascending this mountain of film was to take advantage of that already-established foothold. So Renard would find this individual. <i>Alors</i>. Quite obviously she would not have visited the Gallery when it was closed during the nighttime, and the footage from around 2:30 had doubtless been scrutinized enough already. Furthermore, it seemed distinctly unlikely to Renard that she would visit during the evening; this was, after all, when she conducted her business at the Passione Rossa. Additionally, her nocturnal work schedule ensured that she likely slept in as a routine, and there was no reason to think she would sacrifice her sleep to make an early morning visit to the Gallery.<br><br>Clearly the best time to search for her was in the afternoon.<br><br>But while this logical progression might have been able to flicker through Renard's powerful brain at the speed of light, attempting to explain it all to Mlle. Garrelcette would be a waste of both of their times. So he simply said, "The afternoon would be busiest, I imagine. More potential crowd cover for the thief to plan his burglary undetected, <i>non</i>? Shall we say three o'clock?"<br><br>"Got it." Mlle. Garrelcette briefly brushed her finger across an empty stretch of plastic below the keypad. Renard watched as a tiny white shape, mostly triangular, darted across the screen and onto the title reading "3:00:00-3:59:59 PM". The people on the small camera view vanished and were replaced with a new, larger crowd as the view expanded to fill the screen. Renard was rather satisfied with his understanding of what had just happened. Perhaps he might eventually solve the puzzle of computers after all.<br><div class="quote" author="@evilbiscuit" timestamp="1271906086" source="/post/53739/thread"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-85" title="The Evil Biscuit"><img src="http://i153.photobucket.com/albums/s217/evilbiscuit/kaiseravatar-1.jpg" alt="The Evil Biscuit Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/53739/thread"><abbr class="o-timestamp time" data-timestamp="1271906086000" title="Apr 21, 2010 17:14:46 GMT -5">Apr 21, 2010 17:14:46 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/85" class="user-link user-85 group-11" itemprop="url" title="@evilbiscuit"><span itemprop="name">The Evil Biscuit</span></a></span> said:</div>Recognize someone on the DVD.<div class="quote_clear"></div></div></div><div class="quote" source="/post/53856/thread" timestamp="1272423302" author="@evilbiscuit"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-85" title="The Evil Biscuit"><img src="http://i153.photobucket.com/albums/s217/evilbiscuit/kaiseravatar-1.jpg" alt="The Evil Biscuit Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/53856/thread"><abbr class="o-timestamp time" data-timestamp="1272423302000" title="Apr 27, 2010 16:55:02 GMT -5">Apr 27, 2010 16:55:02 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/85" class="user-link user-85 group-11" itemprop="url" title="@evilbiscuit"><span itemprop="name">The Evil Biscuit</span></a></span> said:</div>Stab at the screen with a finger, eliciting a wrathful response from Lacianus.<div class="quote_clear"></div></div></div><br>Renard's eyes swept quickly across the wing of the gallery. Yes, there was <i>Le roi Midas</i> in its intended place on the closest wall. A couple, arm in arm, were gazing at it. The man said something to the woman, who nodded, and they walked on to the next painting. Not terribly suspicious. Renard let his gaze wander elsewhere in the crowd. Was she here just now? No, it didn't seem so; he couldn't see her, at any rate. He looked back at the Boullogne. A father was hoisting the smallest of his three children up for a look while the other two observed on either side. Renard reviewed the room again. None of what the Commissioner would have called "acting funny", nor any trace of the person Renard was looking for.<br><br>He took a bite of the disappointing croissant and glanced for a moment at Mlle. Garrelcette. She was watching the screen gamely enough, but one finger tapped distractedly on the table, again and again. It occurred to Renard for the first time that he had been working under the unconscious assumption that he would be permitted to watch all twelve hours of footage, and he was promptly struck by how absurd this proposal was. Mlle. Garrelcette obviously wouldn't relinquish the use of her computer for that long, and even if he were to use a public computer, <i>il etait capital qu'il s'hatait.</i><br><br>So he said, "You know, I won't object if you should deign to, ah, hasten the proceedings? I mean if you can make the thing go more swif--" <br><br>But Mlle. Garrelcette required no further instruction. With a few clicks, she brought up two small white characters in one corner of the screen: "2x". Again: "4x". The people in the gallery were now milling aimlessly through the wing at a positively breakneck pace. Renard thought it a somewhat uneasy sight: these figures moving as quickly as if they were running, yet taking normal steps. They made jerky gestures and rocked back and forth slightly as they stood in front of the paintings, and all in unearthly silence, since the camera had not recorded sound. Altogether these visitors to the gallery looked more like shambling automata than graceful human beings. Renard would readily confess, in retrospect, that he must have prodded the screen with his finger a <i>bit</i> too emphatically, but this was merely an expression of relief following such built-up tension.<br><br>He prodded the screen with his finger emphatically, drawing it back as soon as he saw from Mlle. Garrelcette's reaction that he had crossed a line. Nonetheless his excitement did not diminish. "Could you--? <i>Oui, merci</i>!" he exclaimed, as she made another click which replaced the "4x" with "1x". The film returned to normal speed and the automata turned back into humans. Renard fixed his focus upon the point where his finger had touched the screen.<br><br>Yes, there she was, in her dark pea coat and dress, with the scarf draped around her neck. Renard grinned. He saw no reason not to take pride in the fact that he'd correctly guessed when Madame Mangjeol had come by to visit.<br><br>She was approaching <i>Le roi Midas</i>. Renard watched her without blinking. She stood before the painting and cocked her head slightly. She looked down at the folded-over paper, likely a brochure, in her hands. She looked back up at the painting and nodded with a tiny, barely visible smile. After another moment, she broke away and moved on to the next painting. That was all.<br><br><i>Mais non</i>, there was something else. Another figure, who stood in front of the painting toward which Mme. Mangjeol was now moving, had turned sharply away as soon as the information broker had started to leave the Boullogne. This was a person of indeterminate gender, facing away from the camera, whose hair was hidden beneath a baseball cap and whose torso was obscured by a large backpack. This person, who had been circling the wing in the opposite direction and who therefore would have been about to cross paths with Mme. Mangjeol, instead doubled back quickly and started retracing his or her circle, giving Mme. Mangjeol a wide berth and not looking back. The figure was soon off-camera.<br><br>Renard laid an elbow on the table, rested his chin on one hand and gently gnawed a knuckle with his front teeth, not noticing that the action was tantamount to nail-biting. He watched Mme. Mangjeol, who didn't seem to have noticed the other person, proceed along the paintings and eventually glide out the doorway into the next room as if nothing unusual had happened.<br><br>Renard would not have known quite what to make of this if that had been all to see of the encounter so it was fortunate for him that in another couple of minutes the other figure re-entered the frame from the other direction and stood directly in front of the Boullogne.<br><br>She was another woman, that was now obvious: certainly younger than Mme. Mangjeol, but perhaps a bit older than Mlle. Garrelcette. The baseball cap, it was now clear, crowned a head of dirty-blond hair. She wore a striped shirt and a pair of pants with an unnaturally great many pockets. Renard knew the name for this variety of trousers but he couldn't think of it at the moment. Honestly all those pockets looked <i>tres utile</i> and he wondered if he ought not to pick up a pair of his own. But all this was irrelevant to what transpired next.<br><br>She stepped up very close to the painting and looked intently over it, seeming to take in every brushstroke. After a few moments of this, a small boy darted past, accidentally striking her backpack with an outstretched elbow. The woman dropped her own folded-over paper (<i>oui</i>, a brochure) onto the tiled floor. To counterbalance the weight of her tremendous backpack, she instinctively reached out a hand as she bent over to pick it up. The hand might have leaned against the wall, or against the little plaque next to the painting which Renard had read earlier.<br><br><hr><font face="Palatino"><font size="4">Bon Boullogne<br><b><i>Le roi Midas (King Midas)</i></b>, 1693<br>Oil on canvas</font></font><hr><br>But it didn't. In fact, the hand came to rest momentarily on the frame of <i>Le roi Midas</i> itself. <br><br>The woman picked up the brochure, straightened up, and briskly moved on to the next painting. Before long she was off-camera again.<br><br>Renard sat back in his tall chair and finished his coffee. He felt slightly dizzy. A curious feeling had arisen within him that, purely by chance, he and Mlle. Garrelcette had stumbled onto the most important five minutes and fifty-one seconds of the entire film. This should not have seemed to be a remotely critical sequence except that Renard could not dismiss the nagging sense that he <i>recognized</i> this woman; he had seen her somewhere before, without the baseball cap perhaps, but absolutely with the backpack. Why did she seem so familiar yet unknown? What could it be that had touched off in him this sensation of <i>deja vu</i>?<br><br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler4398600').toggle();if($('#spoiler4398600').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler4398600"><i>OOC: Sorry 'bout the Lacy autoing.</i></div><br></div></div>

He was trying to think along two tracks at once and though this should not ordinarily have been a problem for a man of his positively dazzling intellect, he found that the line of thought which Mlle. Garrelcette had initiated temporarily prevailed. "Yes, their nighttime security system is in my understanding rather sophisticated, but during the day they could certainly employ better defenses against, ah, mm, <i>les saccageurs</i>..." He couldn't think of an appropriate English word. "Barbarians" sounded almost right but not entirely.<br><br>His hand made an unexpected dart for the remaining half of a disappointing croissant on his plate. He hadn't thought much of the thing at first but quite suddenly he found himself wondering if it wasn't all right after all for croissants to be so soft throughout. Actually this tasted rather delectable. Renard was still hungry enough to consider ordering another one to confirm his suspicions that the croissants might be in fact the jewel in Demitasse's crown, but the supply of cash remained limited and time hardly any less so.<br><br>The other line of thought took hold again. Renard concentrated on what he had just seen, the details of the blond woman's face and appearance. Yes -- he'd seen her <i>recently</i>. He must have. There was no ancient, decrepit recollection of her to dredge up from the ocean of his memory, only one of the lighter and fresher thoughts skimming over the surface of the water.

She noted the expression in Renard's face, as if he were musing over some way to come up with one.<br><br>"I'm kidding, I'm kidding!

Lacianus slipped her finger into the hole in the middle, and slid it partway free. It snagged on the inside of the tray.<br><br>Lacy gave an embarassed sigh, and turned her wrist slightly. She slipped the disk free, and handed it over to Renard.<br><br>"See, now you know how to put one in and take it out. You're halfway to being Bill Gates," Her smile was simple, straightforward, and showed lots of teeth.<br><br>"Good luck with the case, there.

He knew just where he needed to go next but the prospect of walking there under these conditions did not exactly tickle his fancy.<br><br>When the gallery came back into view, Renard noticed the Commissioner standing just outside the enormous front door, between two of the pillars that made up the facade, apparently giving orders to several other officers who moved down toward the police cars in the parking lot.

Or were you just coming back here to ask how a DVD works?"<br><br>Renard drew himself up to full height in protest beneath the umbrella. "<i>Sir.</i> Let me inform you in all politeness that my knowledge of how a 'DVD' works is <i>exempte de toute faille</i>. I merely wished to bring to your attention a Significant Lead which I was able to glean off the security footage."<br><br>"Oh yeah?" That seemed to have caught the Commissioner's attention. He shifted his feet to face Renard fully. "What're we looking at? 'D you find a Power in there? Something unnatural?"<br><br>"Ah..."<br><br>"Come on, go ahead. Someone who didn't look human? What?"<br><br>Renard swallowed. He was no longer sure he was about to tell the Commissioner anything he particularly cared to hear. "Well, at a few moments past three o'clock in the afternoon, I observed a woman with a large backpack who--"<br><br>"<i>Oh.</i> Backpack lady. Yeah, Landsvale caught her too." Most likely in recognition of the change in Renard's expression, the Commissioner clarified: "I mean he <i>noticed</i> her, Christ. Look, we took down the details but -- how big a deal you think that was? She lost her balance, what was she supposed to do? We're not putting that at a priority right now. Maybe if her hand had gone <i>through</i> the frame I'd be a little more worried."<br><br>"Well..."<br><br>"What else, Rouletabille? Anything else?"<br><br>Renard looked at the puddle on the top step. "<i>En ce moment</i>, Commissioner, that is all I've discovered... <i>en ce moment</i>..." He found that he was mumbling. Renard frowned. He disliked mumbling, particularly on his own part. He would have gone on to speak with greater clarity and conviction if the Commissioner hadn't cut him off. "Yet I--"<br><br>"Okay. Whyn't you go home and take another look? And tell me if you see anything <i>serious</i>." The Commissioner trailed off for a moment; he was looking beyond Renard onto the buildings on the street. He must have noticed that Renard's car had been here the entire time. "Where'd you even--?" But a sudden ringing ended his question and the conversation. It was coming from his pocket, from which he procured one of those cellophones Renard heard so much about.

The massive black-and-white-striped umbrella, folded down again, went onto the passenger's seat next to his well-worn trilby, which he would certainly be sure to bring along with him the next time he had to do any substantial amount of walking outdoors. Before attempting to start the car, Renard withdrew the notebook from his coat.<blockquote><font size="5"><font face="Brush">______________________________<br>__<u>Enraged curator covering something?</u>_____<br>___<u>review security footage for Williams</u>____<br>__<u><font size="4">MME.

Renard confessed himself grateful and suspicious simultaneously: all of this convenience and functionality had to be building up to some kind of catastrophic blowback. Car <i>karma</i>, as he believed they termed it in the Republic of India where he had once spent a balmy, dusty, scented year, was bound to set in. He set the windshield wipers going to sweep away most of the raindrops that had obscured the glass. Then he pulled out of his spot and left the gallery.<br><br><i>Apropos</i> of water, he could tell he was soaking the front seat a bit, but Renard paid no heed to this triviality as he drove through the city. His <i>eclatant</i> intellect had far more pressing matters to attend to. He focused on his memory of the fleeting sight of the woman in the Albarello lot, and of the plastic bag she'd carried. It hadn't been dangling limply, no; the bag had been bulky and taut. The contents must have filled it nearly to the brim. But what had exactly had those contents been? Ah, it was no use; Albarello's plastic bags were an opaque dark gray like the clouds overhead, not transparent. She'd been stuffing it into the backpack's largest compartment, he remembered that much. Not material that could be compressed easily, therefore...<br><br>At the final traffic light, Renard tweaked his moustache in the manner of one revisiting patched memories in an effort to extrapolate more than one reasonably could.<br><br>Then he turned back onto Bushmint Street. Albarello's bright red signage came once again into view. Renard didn't allow himself an instant's hesitation as he parked, entered the store and moved directly toward the photo booth to speak with the employee who'd helped him earlier. He was prepared to face Albarello's menacing florescent lights and towering palisades of merchandise a second time.<br><br>"Hello again!"</div></div>

Not entirely certain of how best to react, Renard did the simplest thing and took the manila envelope out of Tom's hands. He didn't recollect bringing in any photographs for which he hadn't intended a refund. Perhaps one had gotten bundled in with the scrap by mistake? But that shouldn't have occurred. Renard was far too <i>meticuleux</i> about compiling albums to simply leave valuable photographs lying around. Unless he'd simply misplaced this one...<br><br>He unfastened the metal seal, opened the envelope and tipped it upside-down. A single print slid out into his hand.<br><br>Why. <i>Quelle surprise</i>. He hadn't laid eyes upon this one in years. He'd taken it to have gone permanently astray. Very funny how these things sorted themselves out.<br><br>It was another photograph of a man taken from behind, but developed at far superior quality to the rubbish Renard had held forth as his Exhibit A back at the apartment. The backdrop was different, however: not a grubby alleyway but a posh if rather dimly-lit gambling den. The man, who was checking the time on a silver pocket watch in one gloved hand, was clad in a coat and hat reminiscent of Renard's own. Indeed the man's stature and shape was overall quite like Renard's, with his narrow face, high cheekbones, tapered chin and trim moustache.<br><br>The man was not Renard.<br><br>But it was no coincidence that they looked so similar. In fact, at the time, perhaps fifteen years ago, Renard had been snapping photographs of any man he could find whose physical appearance resembled his own so strongly. It would be a pleasure to say that this was part of an ultimately successful endeavor to find a long-lost father or brother but the truth was a bit different. He'd been after a high-profile criminal responsible for a string of robberies. Indeed, Renard had had something of a vested interest in bringing this particular miscreant to justice. After all it had been very difficult to conduct his other investigations when authorities on all sides had been accusing <i>him</i> of being the King of Clubs.<br><br>Renard's brow softened. Those had been his glory days, chasing wrongdoers across Great Britain and the continent. Or at least, he was fairly certain those had been his glory days. To be honest there were some conspicuous gaps in his ordinarily airtight memory from around that time. For instance he really wasn't sure what had transpired on the day that he had taken this photograph in the gambling den. He lacked the context necessary to frame the picture. He couldn't even tell whether, at the time, he had known this fellow's name. <br><br><i>Mais soit.</i>  A lesson in subtlety, this was how he now viewed that investigation. Since then he had been very careful to drum up as little public fuss during his searches as possible. He'd handled things poorly then. Only natural that so much suspicion would have been reflected upon his own naive self as to eventually send him packing from Europe. The moral was understood.<br><br>All the same, merely for the sake of justice and certainly not for the sake of personal vindication, Renard deeply regretted that he'd never managed to work out the true identity of the King of Clubs.<br><div class="quote" source="/post/54655/thread" timestamp="1273711369" author="@evilbiscuit"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-85" title="The Evil Biscuit"><img src="http://i153.photobucket.com/albums/s217/evilbiscuit/kaiseravatar-1.jpg" alt="The Evil Biscuit Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/54655/thread"><abbr data-timestamp="1273711369000" title="May 12, 2010 14:42:49 GMT -5" class="o-timestamp time">May 12, 2010 14:42:49 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/85" class="user-link user-85 group-11" itemprop="url" title="@evilbiscuit"><span itemprop="name">The Evil Biscuit</span></a></span> said:</div>IT'S CHARLES TANNER OMFG<div class="quote_clear"></div></div></div><br>But this was no time to wax nostalgic. The King of Clubs was plainly uninvolved in the mystery at hand. Renard slid the print back into the manila envelope, which he then folded over itself and dropped into one of the outer pockets of the coat. "<i>Mon Dieu,</i>" he muttered. He spoke up. "Thank you immensely, sir. I'd thought this photograph lost to time! A dreadful shame, as you say, if it had been shredded with the rest.

"But I'm afraid I have to ask another favor. You see I in fact never realized I'd left this photograph with you and returned here with the intention of inquiring after something else." His voice dropped to a murmur again, somewhat needlessly he admitted considering that there was no one at the photo booth but Tom and himself. "I wonder if you might recall, shortly before both my own arrival and that of the rather, ah, <i>enerve</i> bespectacled fellow with the shampoo, doing business with a younger woman of blond-brown hair with an overstuffed blue backpack?"</div></div>

She pulled up in a real slick 'Vette and turned every head in the store." Tom let out a chuckle that Renard didn't join him in. "You know, I'm usually not a fan of silver paint-jobs but that thing sure looked great with it. I might just be forced to rethink my stance on the subject."<br><br>Tom thought about going on a bit more about the car but looking through the store windows at the Frenchman's vehicle led him to believe that Renard was not a "car person" so he shifted the conversation's gears instead.<br><br>"So what did you want to know about her? I feel like I should ask you why you're interested in her as well since I can't just give out people's information to every swinging dick that walks in off the street requesting it.

He wasn't in fact completely sure when the last time was today when they hadn't been at least verging upon the brink of ascension. When he'd been trying to figure out how to operate the computer at the gallery's front desk, possibly. He pulled out the notepad and accidentally picked up both pens at the same time. He dropped back into his pocket the one that he thought he'd used more recently and employed the other one for the purpose of drawing a single line, plain yet full of meaning, across one of the older pages.<br><blockquote><font size="5"><font face="Brush">______________________________<br>____<u>Albarello:</u>____________________<br>_____<u>Suspicious individual at checkout</u>____<br>_<u>Mid-forties? fifties?

It had not been their angry bespectacled friend after all. "Vette", Tom had said. Ah. "<i>Cor</i>vette," he had probably meant. Why, Renard knew that name after all. He ought to have; <i>apres tout</i> it came from the mother tongue. If his understanding was correct, Corvettes were rather expensive and desirable automobiles. The woman must have been a bit wealthier than her attire both here and at the museum had indicated... Unless the car did not really belong to her? Oh, well, no use jumping to conclusions. Renard would <i>accorder lui le benefice du doute</i>.<br><br>He tapped the pen against the notepad in thought until he noticed Tom watching him. "Ah, excuse me--" he said. "You see, sir, I am investigating the case of the painting which disappeared from the Gallery of Art two nights ago. There is..." Renard coughed. "...substantial evidence to suggest that our mutual acquaintance the woman with the backpack may have had some involvement in the affair."<br><br>Notepad at the ready, he went on. "So, my good man, I must presume to render audible my curiosity as to whether you might be prevailed upon to disclose her name, if you have record of such a thing about you...? Or if perhaps you've noticed that anything has disappeared from the store? If she is indeed the one I'm after, I can assure you she is quite an accomplished thief."</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Ninety</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Well yeah I know her name but, like I said earlier, I can't really give out personal information like that." Tom noted how hopeful Renard had been in asking the question and lowered his eyes for a moment at not being able to give him the information he wanted.<br><br>"Look, I'll tell you her first name; it's Nicole. That's it though and you didn't hear it from me. I'll probably get fired just for telling you that so keep it to yourself, ok? As for the other part, no, we haven't had anything disappear. Nothing that I'm aware of, anyways."<br><br>Tom glanced back at his station where the prescriptions were starting to pile up then turned back to Renard. <br><br>"Look, I've got to get back to work but you'll let me know how the investigation goes, eh detective?"</div></div>

He let the moustache rest for the moment and focused his attention on adding to his notes as Tom spoke. Much to his <i>deconvenue</i>, however, the employee's revelation was somewhat more sparse and contracted than he had expected. Renard felt briefly betrayed, yet after a moment's effort was able to remind himself that Tom was under no obligation to tell him anything and that even the smallest and vaguest assistance was a favor.<br><br>And at least he now knew the woman's first name. Nicole! A nice French name, just like "Corvette". It was quite possible this would prove enough to get Renard's foot onto certain doorsteps or whatever the idiom was.<br><br>So Renard decided not to press the matter further. Much as he might have hoped to bring Tom around into divulging this Nicole's last name (or perhaps what it was her shopping bag had been so full of), Renard was capable of conceding the struggle. "Forgive me," he said. "It was by no means my intention to put the security of your employment at risk. You have already helped a great deal. <i>Merci beacoup</i>, and for the photograph as well! May Albarello prosper! And may you very soon learn that you helped bring a criminal to justice!"<br><br>Tom gave a faintly embarrassed-looking wave. Several customers looked their way. It occurred to Renard that his voice might have risen slightly in volume as this speech had continued. He smiled around briefly before ducking his head under and fleeing through the cosmetics aisle.<br><div class="quote" timestamp="1273606500" source="/post/54595/thread" author="@admin"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-1" title="LeeTupper" style="border-color: #FFFFFF;"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v202/LeeTupper/New%20avatar_zpsuph1bjm6.png" alt="LeeTupper Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/54595/thread"><abbr title="May 11, 2010 9:35:00 GMT -5" data-timestamp="1273606500000" class="o-timestamp time">May 11, 2010 9:35:00 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/1" class="user-link user-1 group-1" itemprop="url" title="@admin" style="color: #FFFFFF;"><span itemprop="name">LeeTupper</span></a></span> said:</div>Find the hygiene product the angry fellow was looking for by sheer happenstance.<div class="quote_clear"></div></div></div><br>Renard's final singular visual impression of Albarello, which his downturned eyes happened upon on the way toward the sliding glass exit, was a bottle of pale red elixir toward the bottom of the lotion shelf which bore the image of a pomegranate.<br><br>The rain at this point was coming down quite heavily. Renard lingered under the awning overhead the entrance to the drugstore for a moment and poured some bubble juice into the pipe. The smoke drifted up around his face as he reviewed his notes.<br><blockquote><font size="5"><font face="Brush">______________________________<br><u>Mme.

Renard tucked the notepad back into the coat and leaned back against Albarello's brick front wall. He attempted to blow a smoke ring to see whether he still possessed the knack. Well. <i>Faible, mais suffisant.</i> The wispy ring dissipated quickly once it had passed out from under the awning into the raindrops' vertical path. Renard regarded the street full of automobiles and pondered his next move.</div></div>

Renard rubbed his nose and for an instant his fingers twitched downward toward his moustache, but he thought better of it. The moustache was already honed so <i>tranchant</i> as to be able to puncture a balloon. He blew another smoke ring, much more vivid and well-shaped this time, and watched it evanesce in the rain. This was altogether too diverting. His <i>cervelle puissante</i> relished the moment's respite from trying to solve the case of the burgled Boullogne. The day was getting on but he could spare another minute or minute and a half. With lips puckered and tongue pushing slightly forward, Renard successfully attempted to exhale his widest smoke ring yet. He admired the hazy halo as it drifted forward, momentarily highlighting part of Bushmint Street within a nebulous circular frame through which he happened to notice a sleek silver vehicle passing Albarello on the other side of the thoroughfare.<br><div class="quote" author="@evilbiscuit" source="/post/53732/thread" timestamp="1271807102"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-85" title="The Evil Biscuit"><img src="http://i153.photobucket.com/albums/s217/evilbiscuit/kaiseravatar-1.jpg" alt="The Evil Biscuit Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/53732/thread"><abbr class="o-timestamp time" data-timestamp="1271807102000" title="Apr 20, 2010 13:45:02 GMT -5">Apr 20, 2010 13:45:02 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/85" class="user-link user-85 group-11" itemprop="url" title="@evilbiscuit"><span itemprop="name">The Evil Biscuit</span></a></span> said:</div>See <i>that strange silver car drive BY OMFG</i><div class="quote_clear"></div></div></div><br>Renard pushed forward off Albarello's brick front wall and hurried into the parking lot soon enough to catch a glimpse of the figure in the driver's seat, a person with dirty blonde hair a bit past shoulder length.<br><br>Heart suddenly pounding, he fumbled for his keys, clambered into the small black automobile and activated the windshield wipers. The Corvette, mercifully, had come to a halt at a long traffic light.

Obviously.<br><br>Muttering words of religious gratitude in his native language that the small black automobile had persisted in its serviceability, he pulled out of the lot and joined the Corvette at the traffic light with all expedience. He squinted: there was something large and dark-colored in the back seat of the silver vehicle which somewhat obscured his view of the driver at this angle. Renard discerned a wheel and handlebars and realized that it was a bicycle. He couldn't confess to immediately understanding why she would need to transport a bicycle <i>inside of</i> an automobile. Perhaps Nicole was the outdoorsy type after all as he had first suspected although on the other hand this wasn't exactly suitable weather for a spot of cycling around the <i>jardin public</i>.<br><br>After the perpendicular promenade had ended, the traffic light changed to green and Nicole started off. Renard rumbled behind at a healthy distance, not wishing to press too close and risk catching her attention. A pale mist had settled, but Renard had no doubt in his sharp eyes' ability to keep hold of the sleek silver vehicle. <br><br>They turned off Bushmint onto Tectona and from there onto Allheal. Nicole seemed to be moving in a direction familiar to Renard; he drove this way when he had a particular destination in mind, although he couldn't be sure offhand what it was. Certainly he didn't habitually visit the docks on the eastern end of the city by the river even though that seemed to be roughly where Nicole was bound. He briefly entertained the <i>aberrant</i> notion that she must have murdered someone by bludgeoning them to death with the bicycle and now intended to discreetly jettison this sinister weapon into the water.<br><br>He was wrenched from his reverie by an unpleasant surprise. As they approached another traffic light (such an implacably familiar intersection!), the sleek silver vehicle put forth an unexpected burst of speed and passed under the light just as it had shifted up from yellow to red. Renard was too slow in reacting to duplicate Nicole's move and was forced to wait at the traffic light while another train of automobiles passed along the north-south street. "<i>C'est des conneries</i>," he muttered aloud.<br><br>Up ahead, he watched the Corvette pull off the street and down a narrow back alley. Well, an automobile of this size would have no qualms about alleyways. Renard started on as soon as the traffic light returned to green and followed her. Yes, as he emerged from the dingy alley, he saw the river stretch out ahead, with mountains on the other side, nothing more than great vague shapes in the fog. They had arrived at the docks. <br><br>But the sleek silver vehicle was gone.<br><br>Renard brought the small black automobile to a halt outside the alley and emerged, taking his massive black-and-white-striped umbrella and well-worn trilby along with him, the latter of which he pressed onto his head and the former of which he unfurled and opened to ward against the rain. Here on the rear side of the long line of buildings stood an imposing row of garages, many with their tall doors standing open to receive cargo. Renard scurried from open garage to open garage, hoping to find the Corvette parked inside, but had no luck. He cursed again. She'd been so close at hand.</div></div>

This dank gust picked up the hat and swept it into the air, where it richocheted off a post before twirling over the side and off the dock. With a brief, choked cry, Renard watched as his well-worn trilby was carried off by the churning water and eventually bubbled down out of sight.<br><br>He would have pummeled the brick wall behind him in his unbridled rage but Renard was concerned that he might inadvertently cause property damage. So although the hand which was not holding the massive black-and-white-striped umbrella over his head did momentarily curl into a fist, this soon relaxed into an open palm which he rested somewhat feebly against the rain-darkened mortar and clay. No hidden passageway into the building slid open. <i>Le ciel gris et nuageux</i> above took no notice.

Although upon further reflection perhaps there was no need to. Why, Renard had recorded her license plate number, hadn't he? Surely the Commissioner could appreciate that! A first name, a physical description and a license plate number: what more could the Winstone Police Department possibly require in order to apprehend at last this depraved criminal! Filled with a newfound energy and sense of purpose, Renard promptly hurried back toward the small black automobile. Of course it was true that Williams seemed to consider the "backpack lady's" significance <i>dubitatif</i> to say the least, and Renard wondered whether he might in fact do best to claim that it was the burgled Boullogne and not a bicycle which he had identified in the back seat of the Corvette. An inconsequential fabrication if Nicole was not the thief, and if she was... well, Renard suspected St. Peter would forgive him that little white lie. Yes, here was a very pragmatic course of action. He collapsed the massive black-and-white-striped umbrella. The only worrisome element in his view was the fact that he'd never seen the painting; he would be in a tenuous position if pressed for details. When he stepped up to the small black automobile however Renard was somewhat surprised to discover that his concerns on this point had been neatly dispelled.<br><br><i>Le roi Midas</i> was propped up on the front passenger's seat.<br><div class="quote" timestamp="1269837846" source="/post/53158/thread" author="@evilbiscuit"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-85" title="The Evil Biscuit"><img src="http://i153.photobucket.com/albums/s217/evilbiscuit/kaiseravatar-1.jpg" alt="The Evil Biscuit Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/53158/thread"><abbr class="o-timestamp time" data-timestamp="1269837846000" title="Mar 28, 2010 18:44:06 GMT -5">Mar 28, 2010 18:44:06 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/85" class="user-link user-85 group-11" itemprop="url" title="@evilbiscuit"><span itemprop="name">The Evil Biscuit</span></a></span> said:</div>Discover the burgled Boullogne unexpectedly sitting on the <s>couch</s> <i>car seat</i>. A frameup!<div class="quote_clear"></div></div></div><br>There was King Midas, though haggard, not in his royal attire but in a spare tunic. Actually altogether this was not the scene Renard had expected: the king was not standing in a golden palace, gaping perhaps in horror at his accidentally-gilded daughter or whoever it had been in the old story, but kneeling on a riverbank, dipping both hands into the water. The sand below the surface, though mostly painted in dark shades of beige, was streaked with ripples of gold that emanated from his fingertips. The old man's hands were gnarled, his face withered, but there was an astonished joy permanently dawning upon his countenance much like that which must now be coming over Renard himself.<br><br>Atop the painting was a small triangular scrap of paper, even along two sides but ripped on the hypotenuse. It had obviously been torn from the corner of a larger sheet. There was handwriting on the visible face.<br><br><hr><blockquote><font size="4"><font face="Bradley">Hey, you. I can tell you’ve been following me.<br>I just wanted to say that you’ve helped me<br>see the error of my ways. Take the painting.<br>Give it back to the gallery and apologize to <br>them for me, would you? I’m too ashamed<br>of myself.</font></font></blockquote><hr><br>Renard could not move for several moments. He was getting rather drenched and he made a motion to reopen the massive black-and-white-striped umbrella but as soon as his hand came up he instead dropped the umbrella onto the dock heedlessly and unlocked the automobile from the passenger's side. It was either the cold and damp or his <i>avide</i> trepidation that caused Renard to tremble as, to be sure his eyes did not deceive him, he picked the painting up.<br><br>It vanished in his hands.<br><br>Renard cried out again, this time at a rather less soft volume, and clawed ineffectually at nothing as the scrap of paper drifted down unconcerned onto the seat. <br><br>There was another scrap beside it, which had previously been obscured beneath the portrait. This one had apparently been ripped off another corner of the same sheet.<br><br><hr><blockquote><font size="4"><div align="right"><font face="Bradley">Just kidding.<br><br>Sorry, pal. I need to hold on <br>to this for a little while longer.<br><br>Ought to see your face right now.<br></font></div></font></blockquote>[/right][/blockquote]<hr><br>There was a clatter up ahead. Renard managed to tear his eyes away from the place where <i>Le roi Midas</i> had just sat. From one of the garages which had previously been closed, a sleek silver vehicle had emerged. The Corvette wheeled, kicking up splashes of water off the wooden planks, and rattled off toward the street, its red taillights glaring through the haze. Immediately Renard slammed the passenger's door, seized the massive black-and-white-striped umbrella off the dock, hurtled around the hood of the small black automobile, threw open the driver's door and catapulted himself into the seat, which was when he noticed the complete absence of the steering wheel.<br><br>He looked around stupidly for the steering wheel in the back. He even felt around under his seat in a moment of mindless abandon. There was nothing. A few wires dangled at tortured angles from the hole where the steering wheel had been fastened. The steering wheel was, not to put too fine a point on it, <i>ailleurs</i>.<br><br>Renard slumped back against the headrest in complete bewilderment. <br><br>Eventually he noticed that there were raindrops pattering in through the windowpane. Excellent, he thought miserably, exactly what he needed. He didn't remember rolling down his window earlier but was perfectly willing to accept this additional insult on top of everything else that had just transpired. He swiveled the crank by his knees. No window rolled up. He swiveled it the other way. No window.<br><br>He looked around by his feet and the pedals for bits of broken glass. There were none. He looked on the dock outside. None there, either.<br><br>The driver's window had vanished, too.<br><br>Renard closed his eyes and muttered a few words of prayer. He was legitimately beginning to come to terms with the possibility that he might have gone utterly insane. Eyes still closed, he felt around for the two scraps of paper on the passenger's seat, too afraid to look and see that they had disappeared, too. <i>Non</i>, in fact, his right hand fell upon them. He picked them up and, no longer afraid to look, held them out above the dashboard. The handwriting of Nicole. She'd been taunting him, the upstart. He squinted. There was text on the other face of both scraps. He flipped over the first one, which had begun with "Hey, you."<br><br><hr><blockquote><font face="Arial"><div align="right">omplete rules for the payment of<br>rities are available at all airport ticket<br>cations. Some airlines do not apply these consumer<br>travel from some foreign countries, although other consumer<br>s may be available. Check with your airline or your travel agent.</div></font></blockquote><hr><br>And the other:<br><br><hr><blockquote><font face="Arial">loss of or damage to baggage parts<br>hooks or other items attached to baggage. As set fort<br>checked or unchecked baggage: money, jewelry including w<br>electronic equipment, including computers, valuable papers or documen<br>described in more detail in the Contract of Carriage.</font></blockquote><hr><br>The print was too tiny for Renard's tired eyes to focus upon. He couldn't be bothered to ponder its importance. He tucked both scraps wearily into his inner pocket and, resting an elbow on the empty windowpane, leaned his head on his hand. By this time the rain was beyond disturbing him.<br><br>He looked down the dock to the street where Nicole had escaped. It <i>did</i> look like a familiar street. This whole area seemed familiar, although Renard had never been on the dock before. He sank a little lower into his seat. However, he straightened up a few moments later when he remembered why he recognized this part of town.<br><br>He was within walking distance of the Passione Rossa. And as the evening was just beginning to overtake the sky, no doubt Madame Mangjeol had by now made herself available for consultation.<br><br><i>Bien.</i><br><br>Let the archaeologists of future civilizations, sifting through the scattered ruins of this crumbled city thousands of years from now, never conclude based upon their assemblage of the fragments of the relics of his life that Renard Rouletabille was a man who could be induced to abandon his goals and withdraw into oblivion after such an absurdly infinitesimal setback as the dismantling of his automobile.<br><br>"Car," he said unceremoniously, "it is here that we part ways for the moment."<br><br>He opened the driver's seat and stepped out, taking with him only the massive black-and-white-striped umbrella and the contents of his pockets. He shut the door and looked in at the desecrated interior. The rain would soak the driver's seat through to the bottom by the time it cleared. "Please know that I will retrieve you at my earliest convenience," he assured.<br><br>Then, after opening the massive black-and-white-striped umbrella once again, Renard strode down the puddle-covered planks toward the end of the dock and the street, leaving the small black automobile behind him.</div></div>

Although this did not sweep the massive black-and-white-striped umbrella out of his hands and rattle it down into a nearby gutter, it did manage to invert the canvas, splaying the steel ribs madly. By the time Renard had corrected this <i>malchange</i>, his hair was a sopping mess. What had possessed him to abandon hold of the well-worn trilby even for a moment? And where and how might he replace it? He'd loved that hat. It had in fact been one of the very few possessions, along with the coat, the camera, and one or two others, to accompany him when he had exiled himself from his home country. Most of what Renard owned was very new, owing to his frightful propensity for misplacement. The massive black-and-white-striped umbrella which he now contorted back into its original form, for instance, was no more than a a couple of months old, Renard having lost its successor the immense blue-and-red-striped umbrella following <i>une mesentente facheuse</i> with a crimson-haired young man of Oriental design.<br><br>No dissonance registered with Renard that he regretted the loss of the well-worn trilby more than the abandoning of the small black automobile. Even leaving out of consideration the far greater sentiment he had held for the hat, Renard was sure he would be able to reclaim the automobile and repair it somehow later on. Granted, his proficiency with mechanics was as limited as the reader may predict. Renard entertained for a moment the possibility that he would be able to claim some manner of insurance for sudden disappearances of integral structural and operative elements but upon further consideration he wasn't at all sure that he had ever had the automobile insured. He so hated to part with money for intangible returns.<br><div class="quote" author="@evilbiscuit" source="/post/55489/thread" timestamp="1275500690"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-85" title="The Evil Biscuit"><img src="http://i153.photobucket.com/albums/s217/evilbiscuit/kaiseravatar-1.jpg" alt="The Evil Biscuit Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/55489/thread"><abbr data-timestamp="1275500690000" title="Jun 2, 2010 7:44:50 GMT -5" class="o-timestamp time">Jun 2, 2010 7:44:50 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/85" class="user-link user-85 group-11" itemprop="url" title="@evilbiscuit"><span itemprop="name">The Evil Biscuit</span></a></span> said:</div>Think about what sort of Power would be able to make a painting appear and disappear, and try to deduce how such an ability might function.<div class="quote_clear"></div></div></div><div class="quote" source="/post/55552/thread" timestamp="1275696511" author="@evilbiscuit"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-85" title="The Evil Biscuit"><img src="http://i153.photobucket.com/albums/s217/evilbiscuit/kaiseravatar-1.jpg" alt="The Evil Biscuit Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/55552/thread"><abbr class="o-timestamp time" title="Jun 4, 2010 14:08:31 GMT -5" data-timestamp="1275696511000">Jun 4, 2010 14:08:31 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/85" class="user-link user-85 group-11" itemprop="url" title="@evilbiscuit"><span itemprop="name">The Evil Biscuit</span></a></span> said:</div>LANDSVALE IS IN ON IT.

As he walked, he entertained other possibilities. Nicole must be a Power -- this was, by now, <i>une lapalissade</i>. The exact nature of her talent continued to elude him although it was clearly what had allowed her to transpose the Boullogne out of the small black automobile, and most likely out of the Ecruteak Gallery of Art as well. And had her power enabled her to transpose the Boullogne <i>inside</i> the small black automobile as well? How was the vanishing of the driver's window and steering wheel to factor into this?<br><br>Renard rubbed his temple momentarily. His lightning-swift mind had already moved on to another train of thought, an attempt to reason whether Nicole had been working with an accomplice or not. His mind flickered around the other faces he had seen today and lingered briefly on the weary-eyed visage of Inspector Landsvale. As a new arrival under the Commissioner's employ, Landsvale could have assisted Nicole remotely before surreptitiously arranging his transfer from another department to Ecruteak, specifically to mislead Wiliams about the case. Why, Landsvale might even have paid off the lunatic Powers who'd destroyed the apartment building where former Inspector Seth Davidson had been found murdered, <i>precisement</i> to create the gap in the workforce which he himself was later to fill! <br><br>But... Renard brushed a low-hanging branch, the leaves heavy with water, out of his way, not managing to avoid catching a few displaced drops in the face as he did so. Nicole had been alone in the Corvette, he was sure of that. Her power evidently didn't require anyone else's contribution.

He was thinking not so much of Nicole's handwritten messages -- meaningful though they were as his most visceral proof that she was a <i>veridique</i> flesh-and-blood human being -- but of the fragments of printed text on the obverse which had evidently been issued by some airline or another. Should these be taken to indicate that Nicole had only just arrived at the Archipelago? But she'd clearly been here for at least three days; why, then, would she still be carrying around the papers from her flight? What need could she have not only for associates but also for "confirmation numbers" and "bar codes" and the like now that she was here?<br><br>All of these questions swirled around in Renard's mind in a manner not unlike that of a piping bowl of <i>bouillabaisse</i> being stirred with an eager spoon. He thought about ringing the Commissioner with the news, but intuition persuaded him that if he were to tell Williams that <i>Le roi Midas</i> had sat in his car for a scant eighteen and three-quarters seconds, the man would conclude Renard was either lying for attention, trying to cover something up, or off his head entirely. Renard would require answers first.<br><br>He noticed a pudgy man with bushy facial hair passing heavily by on the other side of the street. The mustache was so crudely tended it did not even deserve to be spelled with an <i>o</i>. Renard leaned the massive black-and-white-striped umbrella back to have a look at his reflection in the window of the nearest shop. His own moustache was as soaked as his hair. <i>Quel dommage</i>. He hurriedly tweaked it into respectability. He ran his hands through his hair a few times to get it sticking up as well but he couldn't make as much progress there as with the moustache. No matter. The moustache was the important thing.<br><div class="quote" timestamp="1275763162" source="/post/55566/thread" author="@sapphirevaporeon"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-38" title="SV" style="border-color: #008080;"><img src="http://s28638.storage.proboards.com/3328638/a/AL_EcLgYRzVRvo8FyA2k.png" alt="SV Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/55566/thread"><abbr class="o-timestamp time" title="Jun 5, 2010 8:39:22 GMT -5" data-timestamp="1275763162000">Jun 5, 2010 8:39:22 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/38" class="user-link user-38 group-16" itemprop="url" title="@sapphirevaporeon" style="color: #008080;"><span itemprop="name">SV</span></a></span> said:</div>Briefly entertain how potentially dubious it is to meet a lady in a restaurant called the Passione Rossa.<div class="quote_clear"></div></div></div><div class="quote" timestamp="1275763162" source="/post/55566/thread" author="@sapphirevaporeon"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-38" title="SV" style="border-color: #008080;"><img src="http://s28638.storage.proboards.com/3328638/a/AL_EcLgYRzVRvo8FyA2k.png" alt="SV Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/55566/thread"><abbr class="o-timestamp time" data-timestamp="1275763162000" title="Jun 5, 2010 8:39:22 GMT -5">Jun 5, 2010 8:39:22 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/38" class="user-link user-38 group-16" itemprop="url" title="@sapphirevaporeon" style="color: #008080;"><span itemprop="name">SV</span></a></span> said:</div>Most importantly, <i>Go to the Passione Rossa</i>.<div class="quote_clear"></div></div></div><br>For, while meeting a lady in a bar named the Passione Rossa was not <i>quite</i> such a suggestive activity as it might have sounded when phrased that way, a man did nonetheless wish his moustache trim and fetching for such an encounter.<br><br>He stood outside the bar, with its white stone facade and perpetually closed green-shuttered windows.

The Passione Rossa was so dimly lit overhead that it seemed the owner was counting on the hundreds of glass surfaces all around, reflecting and amplifying the few sources of light, to enable anyone inside to see whatsoever. The rows of bottles stacked upon each other, each housing only a tiny glimmer of illumination, reminded him of a stand of small round candles at chapel. Renard looked around for the source of the music, but no piano revealed itself from the shadows; the tune must have been playing out on a record somewhere. He did, however, manage to locate the table he was looking for. He moved into the room, distractedly returning the nod from the stout man behind the bar. Madame Mangjeol had already seen him enter.

As such he smiled while sitting down across from her, running his hands through his hair again in one last barely-effective attempt to dry it, and tried for a sunny tone. "<i>Bonjour</i>, Madame Mangjeol! How does this dismal day find you? Please excuse my, ah, saturated condition. For too much of the day I've been exposed to the..."<br><br>"Consider yourself pardoned, Renard."<br><br>Renard blinked. Mme. Mangjeol was not looking up at him, but down at her glass, which she twirled first clockwise and then counter-clockwise with one finger. She did not alternate between the two directions evenly; actually, Renard could discern no pattern to the oscillations. He rested his hands on the table. "Yes. Well," he said. "As a matter of fact my automobile suffered a breakdown. Not far from here, fortunately. However that did require me to complete <i>le voyage pluvieux</i> on foot."<br><br>Mme. Mangjeol's eyebrows arched beneath her bangs, and she looked up. "Renard, I'm very sorry to hear that."<br><br>If pressed, Renard would not have been able to identify with complete certainty whether she was being quite serious or not. No matter. "Think nothing of it! So great, madame, was my desire to speak with you that no amount of vehicular difficulty could possibly have dissuaded me." He thought about offering to buy her a drink, then noticed the two unopened wine bottles standing up against the wall in addition to the opened one by her glass. It seemed Mme. Mangjeol's alcohol-related needs were covered for the evening. This was the second marked departure from his <i>coutomier</i> conception of her.<br><div class="quote" author="@evilbiscuit" source="/post/55598/thread" timestamp="1275838516"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-85" title="The Evil Biscuit"><img src="http://i153.photobucket.com/albums/s217/evilbiscuit/kaiseravatar-1.jpg" alt="The Evil Biscuit Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/55598/thread"><abbr data-timestamp="1275838516000" title="Jun 6, 2010 5:35:16 GMT -5" class="o-timestamp time">Jun 6, 2010 5:35:16 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/85" class="user-link user-85 group-11" itemprop="url" title="@evilbiscuit"><span itemprop="name">The Evil Biscuit</span></a></span> said:</div>Find some way to politely and discreetly air out your shoes and socks.

This footwear would require replacing once he returned to his apartment... But as soon as his right hand fell below the tabletop, a sudden change in Mme. Mangjeol's countenance caught his attention. She had pushed back in her seat with an expression halfway between alarm and accusation. Her fingers were clutching, nonsensically, the cardboard -- "beermat"? Was that still the common <i>vocable</i>? Her lips were parted as if she was about to speak. With a hasty application of the logical fallacy of false cause, Renard drew his hand back up quickly and interlaced his fingers atop the table. No, actually, he might have been right. Mme. Mangjeol visibly relaxed. Here was the third anomaly.

He looked around in the bar for some indication of a <i>salle de bain</i> to which he might excuse himself to attend to the socks, but he was somewhat concerned he would be unable to find his way back to her table -- or, come to think of it, that she might have fled by the time of his return, all three wine bottles under her arms. <br><br>As his eyes navigated the room, he blinked in disbelieving wonder at the sight of a figure with shoulder-length blond-brown hair, but Renard's hopes were dashed when this figure turned around and revealed himself to be of the inappropriate gender.<br><br>The next comment from Mme.

You are aware, I fear offending you even by asking, of the disappearance of Bon Boullogne's <i>Le roi Midas</i> from the Ecruteak Gallery of Art two nights ago?"<br><br>"I am."<br><br>A dreadfully short answer. Renard continued regardless. "You know that the painting vanished on camera without a trace and without any evidence of a break-in?"<br><br>"I do."<br><br>Renard straightened up in his seat. "I suppose, then, that my first question, or rather third but I hope the first for which you will deign to charge me, must be this: Can you perhaps tell me whether you noticed anything unusual when you visited the gallery the preceding afternoon?"<br><br>Mme. Mangjeol stared at him for a moment without speaking. Then she cocked her head slightly, much the same way he had seen her do in front of the Boullogne when it had still hung on the wall.<br><br>"What?" she asked plainly.<br><br>"The gallery. I believe you visited roughly around the hour of three o'clock in the aftern--"<br><br>"I'm afraid I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about, Renard," Mme. Mangjeol said, interrupting him for the second time today. This was another action to which he was deeply unaccustomed from her. "I was in Mahogany all that day..." An awkward half-smile came into being on her face, the half-smile of misunderstandings. Renard's eyes widened as his mind combed back through the footage in a heartbeat. Had he mistaken another woman for Yoon Mangjeol exactly as he had just now mistaken someone else for Nicole? Had there been some dire <i>meprise</i>? Was he wrong in thinking that...<br><br><i>Non!</i> It had to have been Mme. Mangjeol -- he had seen her clearly! She was lying to him. There had to be a way to prove she had been there at the Gallery of Art. Ideally, something on his person there and then.</div></div>

Mangjeol the page from the visitor's log.<div class="quote_clear"></div></div></div><br>"But -- but see here," Renard protested, pulling out the notebook and pressing it into Mme. Mangjeol's hands. "Your name is recorded right--" (he flipped a few pages back for her) "--there, <i>n'est-ce pas?</i> Surely that must..."<br><br>He faltered. Mme. Mangjeol, who seemed not at all daunted by the fact that the writing in the notebook was not in English, appeared equally unperturbed by the presence of her name on one page. She looked up from the notebook with, of all the vexatious aspects, an expression of pity. "These notes are yours, Renard. You may write anything you like in them. As it happens I've been jotting down a great deal about the prostitution racket you've been running whenever the detective business has been slow... But somehow I doubt the police will accept my scrawls as incriminating evidence, will they?"<br><br>She punctuated this question by lowering her face to regard him coyly. Her black hair fell forward a bit around her shoulders. <br><br>She, too, was mocking him. Madame Mangjeol and Nicole both. This was yet another unprecedented occurence with her. Renard tensed: he was on the verge of losing his temper. He channeled his <i>rogne</i> into a redoubled search through his inner coat pockets. Ah: his fingers closed on a useful object. "The VDV!" he proclaimed triumphantly, pulling out the rainbow-colored metallic disk.<br><br>Mme. Mangjeol regarded it with <i>insouciance</i>. "Yes?" she asked politely.<br><br>Renard brandished the disk (which flashed much less strongly in this light than in the gallery or Demitasse) over the table with admittedly a kind of savage joy.<br><br>"Within this disk is contained footage from the security cameras of the gallery which proves beyond the shadow of a doubt your presence in sight of the burgled Boullogne two days ago!"<br><br>Mme. Mangjeol looked at the writing on the non-rainbow-colored side of the disk without taking it from his fingers. "I do see the writing," she said with excrutiating patience, "but who's to say this isn't a blank DVD and that you didn't label it yourself? I'm afraid I'm not sure how you intend to prove to me here, in this room, what information this carries... Unless you'd like to kidnap me and hold my eyelids open in front of a monitor somewhere?"<br><br>Renard half-stood up and squinted around the bar, but it was just as she said. No television screen or computer glowed through the darkness to present itself. The faintly rainbow-colored metallic disk was <i>inconcluant</i> in this conversation. He would have kicked the table in frustration if both feet had not, individually and collectively, suffered enough today. His mind raced. She poured herself another drink from the open wine bottle. He had to show her something else.<br><br>Oh.<br><br>Oh but of <i>course</i>.<br><br>"Madame," Renard said. He smiled reassuringly. "Disregard the disk, <i>s'il vous plait</i>, and know that I have no such violent intentions. Perhaps you could merely favor me with an explanation..."<br><br>He produced the folded-up page he'd torn out from the Ecruteak Gallery of Art's visitor's log with a casual yet practiced flick of the wrist which also accidentally expelled from his pocket the two scraps bearing Nicole's handwriting. They fluttered into Mme. Mangjeol's hands in a way that didn't quite seem to agree with the room's ventilation system, but both she and Renard were more interested in the page he was now unfolding. As he sat back down fully across from her, he laid the sheet down on the table such that Mme. Mangjeol could read it.<br><br>"...of this?"<br><br>Yoon Mangjeol studied the page carefully for a moment, during which time Renard leaned back in his seat and poured a bit of bubble juice into the pipe. He was feeling immensely proud of himself for his foresight in removing this page from the visitor's log. It should have been the first thing he'd thought to show her. Renard had her <i>bloquee</i> this time, he was sure of that.<br><br>She looked up.<br><br>"What am I explaining, exactly, Renard?"<br><br>He frowned. Could she truly still be trying to lie her way out? He leaned forward and prodded the relevant entry on the page with one skinny finger. "Don't you see? It says--"<br><br><hr><font size="4"><font face="Snell">A simply breathtaking collection. Your Baroque pieces best of all.<br>Such poignance of visage and posture! The expressive power of a single outstretched hand.<br>Be assured I look forward with enthusiasm to next exhibit.<blockquote>Gloomy Joanne</blockquote></font></font><hr><br>Renard reeled. He spluttered and dropped the pipe. He slumped against the back of the seat. He stared at Madame Mangjeol. She tipped her glass back, her mouth obscured briefly by the glint of light, and set about filling it anew. His heart might have stopped. She smiled at him. "Shall we get you a glass, dear?" she asked. Renard was, in fact, going insane. "Or do you think perhaps you've wasted our time sufficiently for one evening?" This was the only plausible explanation left. The jazz music overhead seemed to have gained several decibels of volume or perhaps it was only new instruments piping up within the ensemble. Renard's magnificent brain thudded. The various glass evidence tubes in one of the outer pockets clinked against each other as he dropped both elbows onto the table and clutched at his matted hair. At any moment they would descend on him and carry him away to an <i>asile de fous</i>.<br><br>No.<br><br><i>Non.</i> He knew what he had seen. He knew what had been on the disk and he knew what had been in the visitor's log.<br><br>Renard was not a madman; Renard understood the truth. But to converse with Madame Mangjeol he needed to try a different tack.<br><div class="quote" author="@sapphirevaporeon" source="/post/55572/thread" timestamp="1275770788"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-38" title="SV" style="border-color: #008080;"><img src="http://s28638.storage.proboards.com/3328638/a/AL_EcLgYRzVRvo8FyA2k.png" alt="SV Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/55572/thread"><abbr class="o-timestamp time" data-timestamp="1275770788000" title="Jun 5, 2010 10:46:28 GMT -5">Jun 5, 2010 10:46:28 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/38" class="user-link user-38 group-16" itemprop="url" title="@sapphirevaporeon" style="color: #008080;"><span itemprop="name">SV</span></a></span> said:</div>Ask Mde.

Eventually his hands slid down his cheeks and his chin ended up resting upon his thumbs. He gnawed gently at the knuckles of his right hand again and considered Yoon Mangjeol. She was looking over the two scraps of paper carrying Nicole's handwriting, which she eventually placed upon the table without comment alongside the glass and beermat, the open bottle of wine, the two unopened bottles of wine, the notebook, the faintly rainbow-colored metallic disk, the page from the visitor's log, and the pipe. She looked at him expectantly.<br><br>"Mad--" The word caught in his throat. Renard tried again. "Madame," he said. "I am... very much afraid we have labored under a misunderstanding."<br><br>"It <i>does</i> seem so, doesn't it?" she said.<br><br>"I... I fear you have been subject to the impression that I might suspect you of having stolen <i>Le roi Midas</i>."<br><br>"The thought crossed my mind, Renard, yes."<br><br>"But--" Renard shook his head. "But I don't! Madame, I assure you that I methodically ruled you out as a suspect as soon as I had the opportunity to! The -- if you..." He gestured at the notebook. Mme. Mangjeol picked it back up and read from the page where she had found her own name. "I'm sure I wrote... well, I might have forgotten the exact wording -- but I discounted the possibility of your <i>culpabilite</i> based on my understanding of you as being much too well-known, and too careful -- and altogether much too, ah, cunning and aware to write your own name in the..."<blockquote><font size="5"><font face="Brush">______________________________<br>__<u>Enraged curator covering something?</u>_____<br>___<u>review security footage for Williams</u>____<br>__<u><font size="4">MME.

Mangjeol read and reread the five-point list, her eyes lingering on the final two points. Then she set the notebook down with a soft sigh. She gave Renard one more smile. This one seemed familiar. Oh. It was the first genuinely warm smile with which she'd regarded him this evening.<br><br>"All right, Renard," she said. "I believe you."<br><br>Some great weight lifted inside Renard's head. He clapped one hand to his forehead and found himself giggling aloud with relief, which did not prevent him from hearing her next words: "As it happens, yes, I <i>did</i> visit the Ecruteak Gallery of Art roughly around the hour of three o'clock in the afternoon before the painting vanished."<br><br>"And can you then perhaps tell me whether you noticed anything unusu--"<br><br>She interrupted him again. It was possible he had not witnessed a complete return to her usual character.<br><br>"We should really discuss payment first, Renard."<br><br>Renard rubbed his nose. "Ah?"<br><br>The warmth in Madame Mangjeol's countenance had not lingered. She was now gazing at him quite seriously. "I'm simply not sure, Renard, whether I can sell you any more information in good conscience. Considering the debt you've already amassed..."<br><br>Renard was stunned. She never mentioned the debt so directly! It was true: he'd been collecting knowledge from her for some time now with only the <i>promesse</i> of future reimbursement, but Madame Mangjeol had always seemed to understand. She knew he was in dire financial straits and only needed to secure a large enough reward to repay her. Why would she speak so pointedly of this arrangement? Renard began looking nervously around the room again. He had once observed the stout man behind the bar train a concealed rifle upon a drunkard who'd accosted her during one of her conversations with Renard. He was deeply concerned she might be about to ask the bartender now to level the barrel at Renard himself.<br><div class="quote" source="/post/55600/thread" timestamp="1275846744" author="@pyro"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-23" title="Yoshimitsu" style="border-color: #2119e6;"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v78/Yoshimitsu/yoshi2.gif" alt="Yoshimitsu Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/55600/thread"><abbr data-timestamp="1275846744000" title="Jun 6, 2010 7:52:24 GMT -5" class="o-timestamp time">Jun 6, 2010 7:52:24 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/23" class="user-link user-23 group-12" itemprop="url" title="@pyro" style="color: #2119e6;"><span itemprop="name">Yoshimitsu</span></a></span> said:</div>Make a mental note of the distance between yourself and Yoon, then the nearest tables, and the door.

Assuming of course I were able to..."<br><br>"Yes," she said almost in tandem, "assuming you were able to..."<br><br>Both trailed off. Madame Mangjeol motioned for another glass. A dark-haired waitress placed it in front of Renard without managing to withhold a second glance at the <i>marmelade</i> of documents on the table. Mme. Mangjeol poured out some of the mahogany-colored liquid into Renard's glass without an offer before filling her own once again. She seemed already to have passed the point up to which the appearance of pacing her intake remained a social concern. The first bottle was empty now and the dark-haired waitress removed it the next time she passed. Renard sipped the wine, which tasted of raspberry. <br><br>"The question, I suppose," Mme. Mangjeol said while flipping through the pages of the notebook with one barely-moving finger, "and don't take offense, Renard, please, is whether I'm to be convinced you know enough about the crime to have any hope of solving it. I'm sure you can see how my conviction or doubt on <i>that</i> point colors whether I might in turn feel comfortable accepting further debt from you?"

I'm not sure whether you would have noticed her there?"<br><br>"She didn't seem particularly excited to see me, did she," Mme. Mangjeol said, answering his question.<br><br>"Ah, well, yes. That is to say, no, not at all."<br><br>The Korean woman's eyes moved again over the second line of the page. "What was it she touched? The '<i>cadre</i>', remind me what that means...?"<br><br>"The frame," Renard translated. "A short while after you'd left the wing, Nicole lost her balance and subsequently leaned a hand against the frame of <i>Le roi Midas</i> to steady herself. She was wearing that unwieldy blue backpack, as no doubt you must recall..."<br><br>"Yes, yes."<br><br>Renard took another sip of wine and wiped his lips. He was on the verge of telling Mme. Mangjeol about the incident on the docks, but some more <i>precautionneux</i> part of his endlessly multifaceted brain warned that this might be a misstep. She would be of course far less likely than the Commissioner to take the story as evidence against Renard's sanity, but even so, he felt it wisest to hang onto that card for the moment. There was always the possibility Mme. Mangjeol would begin trafficking any story that seemed to prove in whose hands the burgled Boullogne currently rested. Renard might cease to be the front-runner toward exposing the crime and capturing Nicole.<br><br>Mme. Mangjeol was rereading the notebook page once more. "How intriguing all this is," she said softly.<br><br>Renard rubbed his nose again. "Quite," he ventured. "Enough to convince you, I hope? Will you make the <i>investissement</i> of telling me what you know about this Nicole woman?"<br><br>Mme. Mangjeol handed the notebook back to him.<br><br>"Let me give you one little tidbit free of charge, Renard. Her name isn't Nicole."<br><br>Renard flinched.<br><div class="quote" author="@sapphirevaporeon" source="/post/55624/thread" timestamp="1275934155"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-38" title="SV" style="border-color: #008080;"><img src="http://s28638.storage.proboards.com/3328638/a/AL_EcLgYRzVRvo8FyA2k.png" alt="SV Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/55624/thread"><abbr class="o-timestamp time" data-timestamp="1275934155000" title="Jun 7, 2010 8:09:15 GMT -5">Jun 7, 2010 8:09:15 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/38" class="user-link user-38 group-16" itemprop="url" title="@sapphirevaporeon" style="color: #008080;"><span itemprop="name">SV</span></a></span> said:</div>Press Mde.

"Dear, if I may, any proper detective would have assumed that from the beginning."<br><br>An insult, yet? Aspersions cast upon his expertise as an investigator? This was one more unwelcome surprise. The blood was rising to Renard's cheeks although the wine might equally have affected this. "Well?" he demanded. "So her name is not Nicole. Tell me what it is, then!"<br><br>She looked away toward the bar. "I'm afraid, Renard, that we seem already to have passed the point up to which information may be exchanged freely."<br><br>"<i>Please</i>, madame."<br><br>"If I provide you with this woman's name, then we've entered a formal business arrangement. And I don't intend that my generosity will extend much farther than it already has." Her gaze returned onto him. From the expression now on her face, he found it hard to believe she had mustered even one warm smile earlier. "Is this what you wish, Renard?"</div></div>

In a moment of stupid understanding, Renard hurriedly pulled out one of the ballpoint pens and handed this to her as well. She wrote on the second-to-last line of the page. A husky female voice accompanied by a piano and bass came on over the gramophone, if indeed it was a gramophone that was providing the music. A block of muted light, tempered both by the <i>bouche</i> sky and the evening hour, wiped itself into and then out of existence at the other side of the room as another customer entered.

Mangjeol, "but her name's come up now and again. One occasionally hears about an inexplicable shoplifting incident and I've got two or three clients claiming to have pinned her as the common factor. No proper allegations, though, to my knowledge, and nothing so grand as a museum burglary! Of course there's also the matter of her dealings with the--" She broke off suddenly and, after an instant's <i>flottement</i>, began to cough.<br><br>Anxiously: "Are you quite all right?"<br><br>She finished her glass, winced, and then smiled. <br><br>"Excuse me. Yes, I'm fine," she said. "What was I saying? Oh yes. Miss Keigler also does business, or at least <i>has</i> done business, with the Giarrettiera family... But my perception is that their arrangement is perfectly above the table. As far above the table as any such dealings can be, you understand." Mme. Mangjeol helped herself to another sip. If the coughing fit had been brought on by the wine, further intake could only <i>aggraver</i> the problem, but Renard reserved comment. The next two lines of dialogue took place far more quickly and with far less mysticism than Renard would have expected.<br><br>"Do you believe she might have stolen <i>Le roi Midas</i>?"<br><br>"I don't know."<br><br>Renard blinked. He tilted his head slightly to regard Mme. Mangjeol from a new angle. She did not continue. "I, ah -- I beg your pardon?"<br><br>"Don't get me wrong, please," she said. "Miss Keigler may very well have an appropriate history, her contact with the frame of the Boullogne might be relevant, and it seems she certainly didn't desire that I should see her at the gallery... but if you were expecting a complete story from me I'm afraid I'll have to let you down. You see, Renard..." Yoon Mangjeol spread her arms in admission. "I have no idea what Miss Keigler's power might be."<br><br>"<i>Vous... vous n'avez aucun</i>?"<br><br>"None at all." Madame Mangjeol had removed her cardboard beermat from under the glass and had taken to flipping it over and over in her fingers in rhythm with her words. "You'll have noticed, obviously, my assumption that she <i>is</i> a Power of some kind. For all of his intellectual shortcomings, I'd say Commissioner Williams is probably right about that, don't you think?"<br><br>"Ah!" said Renard, pleased to have found once again a point of conversation onto which he could latch <i>avec nettete</i>. "You've spoken with the Commissioner, then."<br><br>It must have been the wine which allowed Mme. Mangjeol's <i>typique</i> airy giggle to swell into a full-voiced laugh. "Oh, <i>Renard!</i>" she cried. She poured another drink for both of them. "Actually I suppose that must have happened before you arrived here. Forgive me. Well, let's simply say this: after what befell the last Commissioner, I imagine Perry Williams would rather pledge allegiance to the South Pole Summoners than risk approaching me directly. Not that that's kept him from sending officers to consult with me in disguise, mind you... The poor man thinks he's so <i>clever.</i>" She'd returned to flipping the beermat over and over again. "I digress. No, I was simply thinking of the opinion he expressed to Mr. Whitticker for the enlightenment of the <i>Post</i>. I do believe a Power must be responsible for the burglary, and I do believe Miss Keigler is a Power of some kind, and sadly, Renard, I can't tell you more than what I believe."<br><br>Yet this was hardly a sad revelation at all on Renard's end. In fact an idea had graced his peerless cognitive faculties with its presence. He tweaked his moustache in the manner of one who has just hit upon an exciting plan.<br><div class="quote" source="/post/55632/thread" timestamp="1275958697" author="@evilbiscuit"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-85" title="The Evil Biscuit"><img src="http://i153.photobucket.com/albums/s217/evilbiscuit/kaiseravatar-1.jpg" alt="The Evil Biscuit Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/55632/thread"><abbr title="Jun 7, 2010 14:58:17 GMT -5" data-timestamp="1275958697000" class="o-timestamp time">Jun 7, 2010 14:58:17 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/85" class="user-link user-85 group-11" itemprop="url" title="@evilbiscuit"><span itemprop="name">The Evil Biscuit</span></a></span> said:</div>Yoon's filthy rich.

She continued in a low tone, tapping the cardboard beermat against the edge of the table. "Should it come to me -- and it <i>will</i> -- that you have claimed the reward for the painting, then I'm prepared to give you twenty-four hours from that point until we balance our books.

It was the amble of a man who was looking for something but who was not in a rush to find it. His pace, steady, purposeful, leisurely. There was a jaunt in his step. He twirled his umbrella indolently, raindrops pittering against it and sent flying in every direction as it spun, a black and white blur. Sarosin had just recently bought this umbrella.

Sarosin approached him and ordered something with whiskey.<br><br>He sat at the bar, awaiting his drink and taking the room in.

In another second the notebook, the folded-up page from the visitor's log and the two scraps of paper bearing the handwriting of the woman with the backpack lay in one neat stack. "Now then, Mr. Rouletabille," she cooed, "that should be everything you need, shouldn't it? And you <i>will</i> let me know how things go with Nicole, won't you? I can't tell you how excited I am for you two."<br><br>"Yes, of course..."<br><br>Renard had nothing else to say. He understood <i>naturellement</i> her desire to withhold details of their conversation from Sarosin Narita, with whom she no doubt had an appointment which Renard must now be unwittingly intruding upon, and yet he couldn't help but feel somewhat at a loss. What had Madame Mangjeol really given him except a name? How could he...? But she was asking him to leave. Very well. He tucked the stack into the usual pocket, retrieved the massive black-and-white-striped umbrella from beside the booth and stood up. He'd soaked the cushion considerably but the trenchcoat-clad Narita appeared unlikely to care.<br><br>"Goodbye, Mr. Rouletabille. Until next time!"<br><br>"<i>Oui</i>, madame, until next time."<br><br>She waggled a few fingers at him with an exaggeratedly coquettish smile.

He turned back to squint through the darkness at her table, but she was already embroiled in a <i>tete-a-tete</i> with the other fellow, Mr. Narita. Sensing that his further participation in the conversation would be distinctly less than welcome, Renard decided to leave things as they were. He reached up as if to tip his hat to the bartender, suddenly and shatteringly remembered the fate of the well-worn trilby, and deftly managed to scratch his head at the apex of his hand's ascent, thus making for what appeared to be a fluid and purposeful gesture. <i>Bon.</i> His face thusly saved, Renard twisted the doorknob and exited the Passione Rossa.<br><br>Another beat of thunder heralded his arrival onto the soaked street, where he proceeded down the block toward the nearest taxi stop. Wherever he was bound to venture next, Renard highly doubted he would be able to make use of the small black automobile for transport.<br><br>There were far fewer pedestrians out on the streets now, presenting a landscape in stark contrast to the bustling <i>tableau</i> from this morning and afternoon. Most of the citizens of Ecruteak had sought cover indoors, unwilling to brave the storm. Renard could not say he sympathized; were it not for the loss of the well-worn trilby and the disappearance of the driver's window, he would have no qualms with the rain, which he considered to form a suitably dramatic backdrop for his <i>chasse torteuse</i>. A man passed by on the sidewalk beneath the trees, leading along two children by the hand, all three utterly engulfed but for the eyes and noses by colorful raincoats. "Let's just hope Mommy and Keith find all the flashlights 'cuz you two've got some reading to do, power or no power..." Renard looked back over his shoulder. He had a curious idea this was the father and the older two of his children from the security footage.

The bench was unpopulated. Renard added himself to it and, after crooking the massive black-and-white-striped umbrella over one shoulder, went through his pockets. Something had just occurred to him. He wanted to have another look at the torn-out page from the visitor's log. He was <i>absolument positif</i> the entry had been signed "Yoon Mangjeol" when he had first seen it, not "Gloomy Joanne", whoever that might be. There was the folded-up page. He took it out, unfolded it, and read again.<br><br><hr><font size="4"><font face="Snell">Very sorry, Renard.

This time he scratched his head quite honestly and out of legitimate necessity.<br><br>Renard had already started to wonder whether the fourth point on his list was no longer a constant to be taken for granted and he was now beginning to feel he might have some doubts about the fifth point <i>aussi</i>.<br><br>He was tempted to run back to the Passione Rossa and question Madame Mangjeol about this verbal <i>virage</i>, but Renard did not wish to impose on Mr. Narita and in any case he had Mlle. Keigler to worry about for the moment. What had Mme. Mangjeol meant, that Renard should be able to find Mlle. Keigler "if half of what she'd heard about him was true"? What could she have heard about him that would make his search easier? <br><br>Could she somehow know what was--?<br><br>Why, Renard thought, there were less likely things Mme. Mangjeol could know, and no doubt did.<br><br>Yes... Renard <i>did</i> possess some notion of where to carry himself next. This was a fortunate juncture at which to come to that conclusion since even as he did so, a taxicab pulled over on the curb in front of him.

The paint was many shades under the traditional taxi yellow, chipped and flaked with rust and improvised bodywork. The tires seemed to hold just enough air to keep the rubber from flapping, and the front left wheel never did quite line up with the other three, gyrating on a wild axis and causing a subtle but ever-present <i>thump-thump-thump</i> that oscillated the cab with the rhythm of a rowboat in a hurricane. The interior was hidden from view by heavily tinted windows, but red and yellow lights could be seen twinkling in the oily shadow, and they danced off the edges of several gold chains and woven braids hanging from the rearview mirror. Unintelligible Eastern music ululated mutely from speakers that were clearly turned well past optimum hearing levels.<br><br>A face appeared in the cab window, hidden by thick smoky shadows and illuminated in low red neon. Shiny black eyes glittered in the post-downpour twilight, straddling a tremendous pitted nose, it itself perched atop what might have been the largest moustache Renard had ever seen. He was Turkish - unforgivably Turkish - and when he spoke, yellow teeth flashed from beneath the brushy folds of his wiry Turkish hair.<br><br>'Yes, yes! Is fine, is good! Many room in backseat - very low fare!' The driver stretched a thick, meaty hand over his passenger, whose face was obscured, and beckoned to Renard.<br><br>'<i>Onu sevmiyorum.</i>'<br><br>'Oh, who <i>cares</i> what you think.'</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">‘Damn your fat pig head, it plagues me to my grave! <i>MOVE IT</i>- ahh, yes sir! Where can I take you this fine evening?’<br><br>Renard was at the window now, and could easily see the face of the passenger – or rather, his eyes, glittering like Arabian jewels in the smothered black that still hid his face. They burned into him, trying to set him ablaze with furious determination. The driver waved his fingers slightly to draw his attention away from his less-than-enthusiastic brother.<br><br> "<i>Messieurs</i>, my automobile chose the worst day to malfunction. <i>Un moment</i>, please..."<br><br>The driver laughed heartily. ‘Is no problem, my friend! I have to fight this piece of <i>baka</i> all the time –,’ he punctuated this with a slap on the dash with a meaty palm, ‘is like my wife, yes? Ugly, stubborn, and too wide in the back!’<br><br>As he laughed at his own joke, he watched with hungry eyes as the Frenchman fumbled in his pockets for currency. The little <i>pezevenk</i> had better have good money if this cab were going anywhere with him in tow. Finally he produced a sum of meager dollars and cents, which he presented to the driver.<br><br>"<i>Messieurs</i>, this money is all I have. Would this be sufficient to earn your service for perhaps an hour? I must return to my apartment, which is quite close by, and then I must travel to another location in the city as yet unknown. May I purchase your patience for that length of time?"<br><br>The driver smiled, a wary, forced grin. He calmly reached for the money, grubby fingers barely caressing the green cotton paper as he hesitantly counted what was there. His forearms bulged, trying to control the urge to snatch the money right from the Frenchman’s hand, so pressing was his greed. He thought it over for a moment, then looked up at Renard. <br><br>‘Could you… turn away for a moment?’<br>____________<br><br>When he was sure the Frenchman was no longer facing him, he consulted his brother.<br><br>‘<i>Ne sen düşünür mü, kardes</i>? What do you think, brother?'<br><br>'I think he is a cheap piece of <i>baka</i>. <i>Biz ayrilmaliyiz</i>. We should go.'<br><br>'He’s the only fare we’ve had! I’m taking him.'<br><br>'<i>O kokar</i>. He smells. I don’t like him.'<br><br>'Well, nobody likes you, you shrimpy little <i>pesevenk!</i>'<br><br>'<i>Orospu çocuğu</i>! Whoreson! The dogs choke on your farts.'<br><br>'You talk about our sainted mother like that?! I’ll have your tongue!'<br><br>'You’ll have my fists upon your brow, pig thief! What- <i>HEY!</i>’<br><br>The driver pounced, and with that, the two were embroiled in a bitter slapping match. The percussive cadence of pops and slaps seemed to chime in perfect rhythm to the tinny melodies of the radio, and the car squeaked and grunted as it rocked back and forth. Finally the brother threw his hands up in defense and shouted something in Turkish, and the driver, hands raised to deliver another barrage of stinging backhands, finally conceded. He leaned his head out of his window with an embarrassed chuckle.<br><br>‘Yes, this will be enough. Please, come. Rotheca Avenue, yes?’<br>________<br><br>The interior of the cab was lavish, fit for a prince. The dash, pillars, and roof were covered, every inch, in thick velveteen carpet, smelling strongly of incense and sandalwood and many other foreign spices. Rugs and beaded trappings draped over the seats, and trinkets of all shapes and sizes tinkled and rattled from every corner. Draped from the rearview mirror was a monstrous amalgamation of prayers, images of shieks and saints, tassels, beads, bells, and religious symbols, It seemed ready to rip the frail mirror right off the windshield. Smoke drifted sensuously from the front console; Renard could see that it was the remaining half of a powerful-smelling incense candle.<br><br>As they rounded the block, the driver leaned his head back to make conversation. ‘I am sorry, we have not been properly introduce. My name is Azim ibn Waqas ibn Faruq al-Burak; this is my brother, Faris.’ Faris grunted, folding his arms and trying his best to force his body deeper into the seat. Azim gave him a sidelong glance and continued. ‘We have operate this taxicab for many years – eh, what is word… Faris.’ He looked at his brother. <i>‘Faris.’</i><br><br>‘Eh?’<br><br>‘What is word? We work, ah… self. No companies.’<br><br>‘Freelance.’<br><br>‘Freelance! Yes! We operate the freelance taxicab.’<br><br>‘Yeah, and we’re flat broke because of it.’<br><br>‘<i>Shut up shut up shut UP you filthy bed-wetter</i>!’<br><br>‘<i>ME</i> shut up?! <i>YOU’RE</i> the one who-‘ he started to retort but Azim raised his hand and Faris returned to his brooding silence. Azim smiled at Renard.<br><br>‘Never mind my brother. He is… bitter. Ah, here we are.’<br>_______________<br><br>Waylon Bell watched the cab pull up and could not help but take caution. Who on earth would show up to Rotheca Avenue in <i>that</i>? Oh well, no matter. They would receive the same respect and courtesy he showed any tenant. Everyone who walked through his gilded revolving door would be treated like the king or queen that they were. He took two careful steps off the stairs and approached the cab door, gloved hands at the ready to receive bags, coats, and with this weather, umbrellas. When it opened, his eyes lit up as bright as his smile.<br><br>‘Mr. Rouletabille! Wonderful to see you again. Where, may I ask, is your lovely automobile tonight?’ He gave the Frenchman a sly grin. ‘Left it at a lady friends, haven’t you?’<br><br>Suddenly the sound of muffled shouting in a strange tongue thudded from the cab, and soon the car was rocking back and forth violently as the al-Burak brothers engaged in another battle royale. <br><br>Waylon glanced at Renard.<br><br>‘Friends of yours?’<br></div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Beelzebibble</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Renard extricated himself from the taxicab with reluctance; the scent inside had been intoxicating and he regretted that he could bring no more than a few plumes of the exotic <i>effluves</i> with him out into the open. Fortunately he'd be back in the taxicab soon enough. Renard would admit that he looked forward with somewhat less enthusiasm to a second round of bickering between the two comrades of implacable Near Eastern descent but now that they were in possession of his money the only <i>convenable</i> course of action seemed to be to literally ride it out. He unfurled the massive black-and-white-striped umbrella so as not to incur too much rain while he spoke to the driver at his (slightly rolled-down but entirely present) window.<br><br>"If I do not return within ten minutes, the remainder of the money is yours and you may freely depart. Agreed?"<br><br>The royal moustache curled upward. "Yes, yes! Is okay!"<br><br>Renard nodded and turned to hurry up the steps to the door of the apartment, where the excellent young colored bellhop held the door open and folded down the massive black-and-white-striped umbrella for him. "Mr. Rouletabille! Wonderful to see you again. Where, may I ask, is your lovely automobile tonight? Left it at a lady friend's, haven’t you?"<br><br>"Ah, well..." Renard recalled the image of the small black automobile languishing on the dock near Allheal Lane. "Actually, <i>oui</i>, I suppose, in a manner of speaking--" Unintelligible shouting cut him off. The men in the taxicab had found another point of <i>dissentiment</i>.<br><br>"Friends of yours?" the bellhop, Waylon, observed.<br><br>Renard scratched at the back of his head tensely. He was growing impatient to head upstairs. He'd just remembered that there was a spare key and he wished to situate himself in front of the apartment door with all haste so as to remind himself where it was. "Yes, you might say that. Again in a manner of speaking, mind you," he said quickly. "As for whether it's the same manner of speaking as before or a different one, that I fear I can't tell you definitively." He took the massive black-and-white-striped umbrella back from Waylon, who had actually used the little strap to rein it in, a neat trick Renard had quite forgotten. "<i>Garcon</i>," he prattled, inching toward the staircase, "could you -- could you remind me to give you a suitable tip the next time I'm carrying some cash on hand? It should be soon, I hope. <i>Merci</i>," he concluded already halfway up the first flight.<br><br>There: he was onto the third floor again, and soon standing in front of his apartment door, with the potted bird-of-paradise to one side. Renard tapped one finger to his nose and tried to remember where the spare key had been concealed.<br><div class="quote" author="@evilbiscuit" source="/post/53239/thread" timestamp="1270072013"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-85" title="The Evil Biscuit"><img src="http://i153.photobucket.com/albums/s217/evilbiscuit/kaiseravatar-1.jpg" alt="The Evil Biscuit Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/53239/thread"><abbr title="Mar 31, 2010 11:46:53 GMT -5" class="o-timestamp time" data-timestamp="1270072013000">Mar 31, 2010 11:46:53 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/85" class="user-link user-85 group-11" itemprop="url" title="@evilbiscuit"><span itemprop="name">The Evil Biscuit</span></a></span> said:</div>Find the spare key under the rug. <br><br>Find the spare key under the <i>floorboard</i>. <br><br>Find the spare key jammed in the kickboards. <br><br>Find the spare key taped to the ceiling.<div class="quote_clear"></div></div></div><br>Oh wait. He didn't need the spare key at all. The regular key ring was right there in one pocket of his trousers.<br><br>With a nod to the <i>Strelitzia reginae</i>, Renard unlocked the door and found himself once again in his dear old apartment. He quickly went around the living room and turned on the assorted lamps in their scattered locations atop chairs and stools. The iron chandelier was not outfitted with any bulbs and there was no longer enough sunlight streaming in through the open window to illuminate the room. Actually a modest quantity of raindrops had been streaming in through the open window instead, dampening the chaise longue. Renard hurriedly closed the window, fetched the striped towel off the table and laid it out over the chaise longue in a dim attempt to dry it. <i>Apropos</i> of drying things, Renard then sat down upon the striped towel, unlaced and removed his shoes, replaced his drenched black socks with a new pair off the bookshelf, and restored the shoes.<br><br>And then he did a thing which had been so obviously foreshadowed at the beginning of the story that its execution at this point seemed by any law of fiction <i>immanquable</i>.</div></div>

Could one not instead see the Mariner's Cross, the heraldic <i>ancre</i> signifying fresh hope and renewed effort? And why not?

This was, however, pardonable. Every excess square foot of the floor, after all, was consumed. No surface area wasted. Indeed there was really only a very narrow path leading from the door to the bed: a canyon enclosed on both sides by paper. With all of the newspapers stacked nearly to the ceiling from every available level, the decorations in the bedroom would have been depressingly <i>gris</i> if not for the smattering of pale colors throughout the columns. These were small sticky notes -- a highly fortuitous find at Albarello, before which he'd had no idea they existed -- which Renard had affixed to each newspaper as he had acquired it. The purple tags denoted the papers in whose stories Renard had found nothing mysterious or unexplained; the blue, those which had sparked at least a glimmer of curiosity; and so on up to the red sticky notes which, like the edition he had read this morning, had prompted Renard into immediate investigative action. Upturning all the stacks in order to <i>retroactivement</i> apply this system of visual categorization to the older newspapers around the perimeter of the bedroom had been an exhausting chore, but Renard had set himself to it with aplomb, happy to revisit each dusty old report and editoral in turn.<br><br>This, after all, was his collection. In this archive was a treasure trove of knowledge from decades of <i>Winstone Posts</i>, <i>Whelkshore Tribunes</i>, <i>Brightmeadow Journals</i> and the like, such as any information broker would surely covet if so much of it were not now obsolete. Yes, if this was the true half of what Madame Mangjeol had heard about Renard Rouletabille, perhaps her <i>confiance</i> in his ability to locate Mlle. Keigler was not so ill-founded.<br><br>Renard pushed through the canyon to stand beside the bed, the only piece of furniture here not piled high with newspapers. He surveyed the landscape of sticky notes like multicolored marks upon a sheet of music and closed his eyes. The colors lingered in his mind's eye, suspended <i>en le vide</i>. He raised one index finger. The colors rustled slightly. The finger moved through the air. The colors rippled and darted about in piscine schools. Strands of printed text played out in Renard's mind.<br><br>Purple. Blue. Green. Yellow. Orange. Red. Purple. Blue. Green. Yellow. Orange. Red. Purple. Blue. Green. Yellow. Orange. Red. Purple. Blue.

He picked the paper up. The <i>Winstone Post</i>'s 14 October edition from three years ago. Renard read the top headline. FOREST FIRE THREATENS ILEX. <i>Non.</i> He scanned the other headlines.

Then, after Renard switched off the assorted lamps in their scattered locations atop chairs and stools, he dashed out of the apartment. He even managed not to get the coat caught in the door when trying to exit or bang any shins on the magnificent potted plant, both of which he took as <i>presages excellents</i>.<br><br>"Some weather, huh?" a sopping-wet neighbor of university age and pimpled complexion said across the hall while fiddling with the key to his own door. "Jeez!"<br><br>"Jeez indeed, my young man!" Renard cried. He would have perhaps not so stringently agreed with the youth if it had occurred to him that they had both now taken the Lord's name in vain but Renard did not remain on the hall long enough to ponder the matter. He nearly flew down the stairs in one acrobatic <i>bond</i>, eliciting a cry of surprise from a Hispanic tenant the next floor down.<br><br>"Are you okay, mister?"<br><br>"Quite a bit better..." <br><br>Renard stumbled a little but deftly caught his balance and continued down the next staircase with such <i>entrainement et precipitation</i> that he actually ran directly into a richly-attired senior lady whose embroidered purse slid down off her arm and onto the floor of the lobby. The contents of the purse, accessories and slips of paper primarily, scattered across the wooden surface. "GOOD HEAVENS," she observed.<br><br>"Oh! <i>Excuse-moi,</i> Mme. Pridian--" Renard fell back and hurriedly knelt on the floor to collect her effects while the white-haired woman leaned one hand on the mailboxes to regain her balance in an action not unlike that of a woman he'd seen in the Gallery.<br><br>"Mr. Rouletabille!" she exclaimed. "You couldn't pay a little more attention where you're running, could you?"<br><br>"Please forgive me, Mme. Pridian," Renard said. "I wasn't--" A tube of lipstick fell back from his fingers and rolled away onto the floor. A dark-skinned hand picked it up. The bellhop, Waylon, had glided in to assist.<br><br>"Let me take that off your hands," he said. He nodded at the purse.<br><br>"<i>Ah... Mais...</i>"<br><br>Waylon flashed his signature pearly smile. In this case it was difficult to tell whether it was sincere. "Go on, get out of here, Mr. Rouletabille," he said. "This is what I'm paid for."<br><br>Renard declined the offer to argue and instead merely gave the purse to the bellhop. Waylon set about gathering the rest of the purse's contents while reassuring the elderly woman: "Now, Miss Pridian, there's no harm done, if you'll just give me a second here..." "I apologize again, Mme. Pridian," Renard said to her. "Just be careful, won't you," she said. Renard hurried out of the lobby with a backward "<i>Merci,</i> Waylon, <i>merci</i>!"<br><br>The two comrades of implacable Near Eastern descent quelled their scuffle just long enough to hear him give them the address.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Again with regret, Renard pushed open the taxicab's door and removed himself from the back seat, taking care not to leave behind the massive black-and-white-striped umbrella, which he promptly opened since the rain had not at all diminished. He staggered forward a bit again before recovering himself. His legs, after the impact from descending the apartment stairs, had not been prepared for such a ride as this. Renard could not exactly say he would miss the Turkish fellow's <i>casse-cou</i> driving -- and he was completely baffled as to how the other man could have fallen asleep along the way -- but the scents and stories within the automobile were a different thing. "Thank you," he told the driver. "You are a good storyteller, sir..."<br><br>As the taxicab rattled off, leaving Renard on the corner of Rosemary &amp; Pennyroyal, he wondered how he would subsequently return to the heart of the city. Well, once he had apprehended Mlle. Keigler and secured <i>Le roi Midas</i>, no doubt he would be able to use her telephone to call the police. They would escort the detective, the criminal and the painting all to their respective proper locations.<br><br>Renard looked around the neighborhood, grayed by the rainfall but still quite <i>seigneurial</i>, with most of the houses set up from the street upon forested hills, as 82 Pennyroyal had been in the photograph. The street was not paved with cement but rather overlaid with red rounded bricks. The water cascaded down through the indentations toward flatter land. There was something unusual about the entire neighborhood which he could not quite identify. Ah, <i>non</i>, it was the fact that none of the houses were lit. The sky was dark enough at this point that they ought to have been. Renard remembered what the father had said to his children. Perhaps this neighborhood had suffered a power outage. Renard's understanding was that a bolt of <i>eclairage</i> needed no more than graze a telephone pole and the entire area would be crippled.<br><br>Undeterred, Renard set off around the corner onto Pennyroyal. He was approaching Mlle. Keigler's house from numerically above. The mailboxes read "96... 94... 92... 90... 88..." and then the house from the photograph came into view.<br><div class="quote" source="/post/56192/thread" timestamp="1277388884" author="@evilbiscuit"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-85" title="The Evil Biscuit"><img src="http://i153.photobucket.com/albums/s217/evilbiscuit/kaiseravatar-1.jpg" alt="The Evil Biscuit Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/56192/thread"><abbr title="Jun 24, 2010 4:14:44 GMT -5" class="o-timestamp time" data-timestamp="1277388884000">Jun 24, 2010 4:14:44 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/85" class="user-link user-85 group-11" itemprop="url" title="@evilbiscuit"><span itemprop="name">The Evil Biscuit</span></a></span> said:</div>Sneak around and try to get inside unnoticed.<div class="quote_clear"></div></div></div><div class="quote" author="@evilbiscuit" timestamp="1277388884" source="/post/56192/thread"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-85" title="The Evil Biscuit"><img src="http://i153.photobucket.com/albums/s217/evilbiscuit/kaiseravatar-1.jpg" alt="The Evil Biscuit Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/56192/thread"><abbr data-timestamp="1277388884000" class="o-timestamp time" title="Jun 24, 2010 4:14:44 GMT -5">Jun 24, 2010 4:14:44 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/85" class="user-link user-85 group-11" itemprop="url" title="@evilbiscuit"><span itemprop="name">The Evil Biscuit</span></a></span> said:</div>Step in something unsettling.<div class="quote_clear"></div></div></div><br>The sleek silver Corvette was not parked in the driveway. Possibly Mlle. Keigler was still out although <i>egalement</i> she might have made the sensible choice to store the vehicle in the garage. Renard hung back, unwilling to approach the house directly, but he couldn't discern a face pressed up against any of the windows to observe him. Even so, he balked at the idea of crossing in front of the house to climb the driveway. Much too visible. Renard rocked back and forth on his heels for a moment and glanced quickly around the neighborhood again, but there seemed to be no one watching him.<br><br>Eventually he trod gingerly onto the property, moving through the garden so as to take what cover was available among the bushes. His shoes sank a bit into the damp, clingy mulch in an altogether unsettling way. He hurried up the lawn and passed the front porch to the garage, whose two massive doors included squat, wide glass windows. Renard peered through the glass into the darkness. The sleek silver Corvette wasn't there, just a bicycle propped up against a stepladder on one wall. So Mlle. Keigler was still out after all. <i>Quel commode.</i><br><br>Renard stepped up the stairs onto the front porch and tried the door. Locked, of course. No obstacle to an experienced sleuth of his caliber. Renard retrieved the lockpick which this morning had been threaded through the handles of the refrigerator and which since then had been protruding slightly uncomfortably from one pocket of his trousers. Renard inserted the hooked tip of the lockpick into the lock and twiddled it until a barely audible click and a faint change in tension told him that the first pin had been pushed upward to its shear point. He repeated this for the other four pins, further and further into the lock, and then withdrew the lockpick. He tried turning the doorknob. This time the door opened and allowed Renard to take his first few steps into the <i>maison</i> of the thief who had stolen the Burgled Boullogne.<br><div class="quote" author="@ch00beh" timestamp="1277343914" source="/post/56177/thread"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-8" title="ch00beh" style="border-color: #666699;"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v487/Andurin/e109900a-d9c0-455e-9a18-7b21ddc48211_zps3cc7bef1.jpg" alt="ch00beh Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/56177/thread"><abbr data-timestamp="1277343914000" class="o-timestamp time" title="Jun 23, 2010 15:45:14 GMT -5">Jun 23, 2010 15:45:14 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/8" class="user-link user-8 group-2" itemprop="url" title="@ch00beh" style="color: #666699;"><span itemprop="name">ch00beh</span></a></span> said:</div>solve the mystery.<div class="quote_clear"></div></div></div><br>The hallway was of course quite dark.

Once Renard could be certain that his heart had returned to its usual pace and consistency, he managed to smile and pat the brute on the head. It panted up at him happily.

He was now in another large room on the front side of the house. There were some cylinders standing vertically on a cabinet under the <i>defunts</i> lightswitches. Were they...? Renard picked one up and fiddled with it. A circle of light blinked into existence on the far wall. Yes, a flashlight. As to why four or five of them had been grouped in the same location, Renard couldn't say. Surely it would be wiser to disperse them throughout the house? But no matter. He moved the light around to investigate the living room, as this now revealed itself to be.<br><br>Firstly he noticed something unusual about the shelves. They were not traditional bookshelves of the massive variety which he possessed in his apartment. Why, each of them was in fact three or four much smaller shelves stacked on top of each other. So too he noticed that the table at the far end of the room was not one great rectangular table but rather two smaller square tables stood side-to-side. There was no sofa but only a few plush chairs in front of the television. Here was a living room furnished with all the proper <i>accoutrements</i>, yet all of them were fragmented into disparate elements; no fixture was too bulky or heavy to pick up and carry alone. And the flashlights were not the only small collection of similar objects in the room. All of the plastic cases containing VDVs were stacked in two equal columns: alphabetically, as Renard realized when he drew nearer. All of the magazines on the small coffee table by the plush chairs were likewise organized. The framed photographs on the mantel were neatly aligned in a row, although one of the frames had been turned around so as to face the brick chimney instead of the room. The books (this was growing harder and harder for Renard to believe) were sorted approximately by the color of their spines. There were paintings -- none <i>Le roi Midas</i>, Renard was sorry to see -- on each wall, and they seemed to have been grouped by subject matter: flowers on the north wall, landscapes on the east, animals on the west, people on the south. Even when similar items were not arranged together, there was a symmetry to their placement: the four vases stood in two opposing pairs on opposite sides of the room; a globe atop one bookshelf was mirrored by a model yacht atop another. The house, Renard suddenly realized, was exactly as filled with objects as his own apartment -- but while Renard's home was an <i>encombre</i> mess, Mlle. Keigler's was a vision of almost inhospitable perfection.<br><br>There was only one item in this room that seemed out of place. At one corner of one of the square adjacent tables lay open a dark gray plastic shopping bag, such as might have been supplied by a drugstore one of whose services could hypothetically have been the development of photographs.</div></div>

He crossed the room toward the fireplace and surveyed the framed photographs on the mantel. The central and largest portrait depicted a family of five: the father bespectacled but not bookish-looking, muscled, with receding blond hair; the mother a brunette of working stock, holding a tiny girl of the same hair color in her stout arms; two more children, both blond, a boy and a girl, in the foreground, the son slumped, baseball-capped, wearing a <i>contraint</i> smile, the daughter's head turned aside, only just catching the cameraman out of the corner of her eye. Renard studied the photograph carefully. If this was <i>la famille Keigler</i>, he believed he was now looking at Channery.<br><br>He moved along the fireplace, taking in the other scenes with the help of the flashlight. The mother and father, arm-in-arm, sat on a stone wall against a Mediterranean sunset; the brother, older now, stood in full baseball attire on green turf, with his bat at the ready; the little sister, perhaps ten in this image, was discernible from out of a choir of girls in white blouses and dark skirts. There again was Channery, younger actually than in the central photograph, toddling alongside her mother down an <i>ensoleille</i> street and clutching a stuffed squirrel half her size; there again, a graduate in robe and cap, hugging her father amid a cluster of similarly dressed youths.<br><br>Renard reached out for the reversed frame, took it off the mantel, and flipped it over. Then he blinked and looked at the other photographs again. He didn't recognize this young man with the ruffled brown hair who was sitting on an open windowpane while Channery, in the foreground, applied a screwdriver to a piece of machinery whose function vastly eluded the French detective. Not a member of the immediate family, clearly. A cousin? An unrelated acquaintance? Well obviously, whoever he was, this young man must have fallen out of Mlle. Keigler's favor for her to have turned around the frame like that. This made sense for roughly two and a half seconds until it occurred to Renard to wonder why she would have bothered to keep the photograph there rather than move it to a less conspicuous location such as the <i>grenier</i> or simply throwing it out.<br><div class="quote" source="/post/56267/thread" timestamp="1277665429" author="@ninety"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-66" title="Ninety"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/y5MlxQ8.jpg" alt="Ninety Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/56267/thread"><abbr data-timestamp="1277665429000" class="o-timestamp time" title="Jun 27, 2010 9:03:49 GMT -5">Jun 27, 2010 9:03:49 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/66" class="user-link user-66 group-0" itemprop="url" title="@ninety"><span itemprop="name">Ninety</span></a></span> said:</div>Realize you're there to solve the goddamn mystery.<div class="quote_clear"></div></div></div><div class="quote" author="@evilbiscuit" source="/post/56214/thread" timestamp="1277417453"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-85" title="The Evil Biscuit"><img src="http://i153.photobucket.com/albums/s217/evilbiscuit/kaiseravatar-1.jpg" alt="The Evil Biscuit Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/56214/thread"><abbr data-timestamp="1277417453000" class="o-timestamp time" title="Jun 24, 2010 12:10:53 GMT -5">Jun 24, 2010 12:10:53 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/85" class="user-link user-85 group-11" itemprop="url" title="@evilbiscuit"><span itemprop="name">The Evil Biscuit</span></a></span> said:</div>INVESTIGATE THAT BAG<div class="quote_clear"></div></div></div><div class="quote" source="/post/56267/thread" timestamp="1277665429" author="@ninety"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-66" title="Ninety"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/y5MlxQ8.jpg" alt="Ninety Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/56267/thread"><abbr title="Jun 27, 2010 9:03:49 GMT -5" class="o-timestamp time" data-timestamp="1277665429000">Jun 27, 2010 9:03:49 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/66" class="user-link user-66 group-0" itemprop="url" title="@ninety"><span itemprop="name">Ninety</span></a></span> said:</div>Ruffle through Albarello bag.

He set the frame back upon the mantel, reversed again in accordance with the owner's wishes, and turned his attention to the much more <i>fascinant</i> matter of the shopping bag from Albarello. <br><br>His slender fingers batted away the plastic straps and pulled the first manila envelope from the bag, for indeed manila envelopes in plentiful supply were the contents thereof. Not handguns, explosives or even a grappling hook affixed to a length of rope -- mere manila envelopes exactly like the one Tom the Albarello employee had given to Renard. Each carried a sticker with one name beneath the Albarello logo and a few unintelligible strings of digits:<br><br><hr><font face="Courier"><font size="4">HATFIELD, NICOLE</font></font><hr><br>"<i>Peu vraisemblable,</i>" Renard muttered aloud.<br><br>Photographs. Splendid. Now he had her. Here he would find images snapped of <i>Le roi Midas</i> from all angles and of countless other nooks and crannies throughout the Winstone Gallery of Art, whose development at Albarello had been delayed, which hadn't stopped Mlle. Keigler from envisioning the gallery and formulating her plan of entrance all by herself. Or else pictures from after the theft, revealing Mlle. Keigler and other depraved villains cavorting at some illicit celebration of the money the burgled Boullogne would provide them, perhaps using the painting, flipped upside-down and supported by chairs, as a table for some perverse "drinking game".<br><br>Renard opened the first envelope, shook out the photographs into his hand, and shone the flashlight upon them with a grin of accomplishment. Then the grin faded. Then he held up the first photograph on the stack for closer inspection. Then he looked away. Then he squinted back at the photograph. Then he looked away again.<br><br>Represented in the photograph were the two small square tables which currently stood side-to-side in front of him.<br><br>Renard looked back at the photograph and then back at the two small square tables. Yes, they were identical, the only difference of course being the absence of the Albarello shopping bag in the photograph. He slid the photograph around to the bottom of the stack and looked at the next one. The columns of VDVs were depicted there in perfect arrangement, exactly as they appeared in real life. Another photograph. There was the globe atop one of the bookshelves. Another photograph. The television. Another. The paintings on the eastern wall. The next few. The plush chairs. The next handful. The books on each shelf: those with black spines, those with brown, with gray, with white...<br><br>Renard set the stack down upon one of the small square tables and seized the next manila envelope. He shook out the photographs into his hand. They depicted a kitchen. He took another few manila envelopes along with him under his arm as he moved out of the living room, the flashlight's illumination guiding his path. <i>Oui,</i> here was the kitchen, with more small tables and stools, and several miniature refrigerators arranged in a row on a short, wide folding table rather than one full-sized unit. He stuffed the kitchen photographs back into their envelope and opened the next one as he moved on. Here was the dining room. Everything was photographed. The study, likewise. And so for the salon, and the deck outside. Even the first-floor bathroom and closet were documented.<br><br>Once he had wound around the first floor back into the main hallway, Renard had exhausted the envelopes he'd taken with him. The Caucasian shepherd, splayed out on the staircase, dozed, absolutely unconcerned by Renard's presence. The rain battered <i>insistantment</i> the glass of the front door. Renard returned to the living room.<br><br>He set the manila envelopes he'd taken with him back down upon the table and picked up the living room stack again. After passing by the magazines on the coffee table, the frames on the mantel, the model yacht, and so on, the photographs abruptly switched to wide snapshots of the entire room from various angles, not focused upon any isolated details. This had been the pattern for the photographs at the bottom of each of the other stacks as well, and in each case the sudden shift had struck Renard as faintly eerie. As he flipped through the wide shots of the living room he felt an uncomfortable prickle around the back of his neck. A nonsensical idea had fixed in his head which he could not shake: that as he turned each photograph over to the bottom of the stack and revealed the next one, eventually he would come upon a photograph that depicted Renard himself standing there, in the living room, perhaps even holding up the stack and the flashlight; and that after that, the next photograph would depict someone or something else emerging out of the <i>tenebres</i> to greet him...<br><br>Once he'd reached the end and circled back around to the photograph of the two small square tables, he put the stack back down onto the aforementioned two tables a little hurriedly.<br><br>From the hallway he heard the dog let forth a brief, lazy whine.<br><div class="quote" timestamp="1277665429" source="/post/56267/thread" author="@ninety"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-66" title="Ninety"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/y5MlxQ8.jpg" alt="Ninety Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/56267/thread"><abbr title="Jun 27, 2010 9:03:49 GMT -5" class="o-timestamp time" data-timestamp="1277665429000">Jun 27, 2010 9:03:49 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/66" class="user-link user-66 group-0" itemprop="url" title="@ninety"><span itemprop="name">Ninety</span></a></span> said:</div>Frown.<div class="quote_clear"></div></div></div><div class="quote" author="@admin" source="/post/55560/thread" timestamp="1275715070"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-1" title="LeeTupper" style="border-color: #FFFFFF;"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v202/LeeTupper/New%20avatar_zpsuph1bjm6.png" alt="LeeTupper Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/55560/thread"><abbr data-timestamp="1275715070000" class="o-timestamp time" title="Jun 4, 2010 19:17:50 GMT -5">Jun 4, 2010 19:17:50 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/1" class="user-link user-1 group-1" itemprop="url" title="@admin" style="color: #FFFFFF;"><span itemprop="name">LeeTupper</span></a></span> said:</div>Consider the possibility that all of your misfortunes today stem from one action earlier in the morning.

Where was <i>Le roi Midas</i>? Upstairs? Downstairs? Or was it even here in the house? How had Renard bumbled his way through this absurd fool's quest all the way here and yet never managed to answer one question without two more taking its place? Why had he taken on this <i>cachotterie baroque</i> at all? So far it had yielded nothing except grounds to question his own sanity. Renard wished he had never started into this case. If only he had filled his pipe with bubble juice instead of tobacco this morning! He bemoaned the mistake as he stood the flashlight on end upon one table. For if he had filled the pipe with bubble juice instead of tobacco, it would have produced smoke instead of bubbles, thus preventing him from needing to smoke the rest of the bubbles out the window. In turn this meant he might not have noticed when Mr. Breck the mailman had arrived, and if another diversion had caught his attention sufficiently to forget about the mail altogether today, no doubt Commissioner Williams and Inspector Landsvale would have solved the mystery and arrested Mlle. Keigler without Renard needing to lift a finger. <br><br>Also the well-worn trilby would still be in his possession. <br><br>That settled it. Renard vowed never again to let the small box of tobacco with enclosed matchbook from Le Chat du Noir and the tiny plastic bottle of pink bubble juice confound him. He puffed the pipe stoically, expecting tendrils of smoke to waft upward obligingly, and spluttered as great pink bubbles emerged instead. <i>En sa songerie</i> he had filled the pipe with tobacco instead of bubble juice. Well! His mind had been elsewhere and anyway this was the last time it would happen. Renard had more important things to think about. He set off with the intention of pacing the living room in furious thought for a few laps, then perhaps to collect the remaining manila envelopes and explore the rest of the house, but unfortunately his foot caught on a leg of one of the plush chairs and Renard stumbled. The pipe fell from his lips and skipped away onto the dark floor somewhere.<br><br>"<i>Zut alors!</i>" he grunted.<br><br>He seized the flashlight off the table and stooped over to fumble around in the shadows for the pipe. He had an idea it had rolled under the coffee table. Then all at once an electric wheeze sounded throughout the house and the lights in the neighborhood came back on. The living room, fully lit, revealed a woman with dirty-blond hair standing in the doorway which led toward the kitchen. In one hand she was holding up Renard's pipe.<br><br>"This yours?"<br><br><div align="center"><img src="http://i322.photobucket.com/albums/nn433/asgardreid/channery.png" style="max-width: 100%;"></div><br><div class="quote" author="@pyro" source="/post/53152/thread" timestamp="1269818364"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-23" title="Yoshimitsu" style="border-color: #2119e6;"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v78/Yoshimitsu/yoshi2.gif" alt="Yoshimitsu Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/53152/thread"><abbr title="Mar 28, 2010 13:19:24 GMT -5" class="o-timestamp time" data-timestamp="1269818364000">Mar 28, 2010 13:19:24 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/23" class="user-link user-23 group-12" itemprop="url" title="@pyro" style="color: #2119e6;"><span itemprop="name">Yoshimitsu</span></a></span> said:</div>An awkward situation!<div class="quote_clear"></div></div></div></div></div>

"<i>Mademoiselle</i>," he declared, "you may laugh now, but I have just dialed 911 on my cellophone! Very soon the police shall arrive, clap you in irons and take you away. Then we shall see who giggles and guffaws loudest!"<br><br>Channery had ceased laughing.<br><br>"Really? No. Damn!" She considered this for a moment. "Out of curiosity, who's your network? Centel?"<br><br>"<i>Ah... oui.</i>"<br><br>"No kidding." Channery lowered her face and gazed at him in a manner irritatingly reminiscent of Mme. Mangjeol. "How's that working out for you? Made any calls since 1993? No?" Renard fumbled for words. She leaned against the doorframe and crossed her arms. "Have I lost -- I've lost you. 'Kay. You're bullshitting me. That's the SparkNotes version. I call your bullshit."<br><br>"But...!" Renard blustered.<br><br>"Now of course <i>I</i> could call the cops and have you taken in pretty easily. Actually, I'm not sure -- are you...?" She straightened up off the doorframe again. One hand dropped to her side. "You remember the specifics on breaking and entering around here? Cause I forget. But I'm <i>pretty</i> sure right now I'm technically allowed to kill you." Renard jumped. <i>Soudainement</i> Channery was holding a golf club which he certainly had not seen anywhere in the room previously. She stepped forward. She was not smiling. "Right? Is that how it works? Maybe I'll just break your arms and smash your kneecaps. The defense can totally swing that."<br><br>The third brief flash of inspiration which arrived to <i>frapper a la porte</i> of the hallowed hall of Renard's mind was to run for it.<br><br>However the moment he turned for the hallway he was confronted with the burly shape of the Caucasian shepherd, standing in the other doorframe and displaying a <i>monstreux</i> snarl.

He was pleasantly surprised. After a sound like a <i>petard</i> going off, a thick cloud of grayish-pink smoke filled the living room. Channery invoked the Lord's name in vain and buckled down, rubbing her eyes and coughing. A stealthy retreat now seemed the sensible action. Renard took a few steps toward the hallway and suddenly wondered whether he had been struck by a cannonball. Actually it was the enormous dog Micmac which planted two beefy paws upon his shoulders and pinned him to the living room floor. Renard cried out in shock and the Caucasian shepherd responded with an eardrum-shattering bark full on in his face. Renard's limbs turned to jelly, his bones rattled to the marrow.<br><br>Channery stood up with a wheeze. She had tossed the golf club aside and was now clutching a fire extinguisher, presumably as a reflexive response to the sight of smoke; though there was obviously no <i>risque d'incendie</i> she did not put the extinguisher down. "Holy <i>shit</i>," she said slowly. "The hell kind of smoke bomb was that? Rig that yourself?"<br><br>Renard would have responded in the negative but he was having a hard enough time breathing without the addition of speech onto his present list of concerns.<br><br>"Micmac."<br><br>The brute's head jerked upward to regard Channery with wide, adoring eyes.<br><br>Channery beamed. "Who's a good boy Micmac?"<br><br>The brute panted happily. Saliva dripped down onto the gasping Renard's lapel. He would have protested if this were possible.<br><br>"Who's gonna take this guy's leg off at the knee if he tries escaping again."<br><br>The brute snarled down at Renard. Snarling inspired less sheer heartstopping terror than the bark. Rather it evoked more <i>lent</i> skin-crawling horror.<br><br>"That's what I thought. Then I guess Micmac that it is <i>you</i> who's the good boy. Now step off before you crush the man, would you."<br><br>Micmac heaved his bulky frame off of Renard and lumbered back to his post at the doorframe leading into the hallway. Renard pushed himself up onto his hands with deep breaths. Channery squatted down beside him, her cargo pants bristling with tools, and rested the fire extinguisher on one knee.<br><div class="quote" source="/post/56380/thread" timestamp="1277958170" author="@evilbiscuit"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-85" title="The Evil Biscuit"><img src="http://i153.photobucket.com/albums/s217/evilbiscuit/kaiseravatar-1.jpg" alt="The Evil Biscuit Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/56380/thread"><abbr data-timestamp="1277958170000" class="o-timestamp time" title="Jun 30, 2010 18:22:50 GMT -5">Jun 30, 2010 18:22:50 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/85" class="user-link user-85 group-11" itemprop="url" title="@evilbiscuit"><span itemprop="name">The Evil Biscuit</span></a></span> said:</div>Try diplomacy!<div class="quote_clear"></div></div></div><div class="quote" author="@ninety" timestamp="1277945977" source="/post/56370/thread"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-66" title="Ninety"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/y5MlxQ8.jpg" alt="Ninety Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/56370/thread"><abbr title="Jun 30, 2010 14:59:37 GMT -5" class="o-timestamp time" data-timestamp="1277945977000">Jun 30, 2010 14:59:37 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/66" class="user-link user-66 group-0" itemprop="url" title="@ninety"><span itemprop="name">Ninety</span></a></span> said:</div><s>Get her to</s> say her name <s>backwards so she gets sent back to the 5th dimension for 90 days.

"'Nicole Hatfield' is the pseudonym under which you enlisted the services of Tom the Albarello employee to develop these baffling phot--" He was interrupted by the sensation of Channery slamming the bottom of the fire extinguisher against his chest, pressing him back against the cabinet behind him. Now it was his turn to wheeze. She leaned in very close.<br><br>"See this?" she said softly and rather unnecessarily in reference to the fire extinguisher. Eyes wide, he nodded.<br><br>"I'm keeping your teeth inside your head <i>for the moment</i>. For the -- key word there. Moment. Okay? So you can answer me instead of gargling and bleeding. After that, you and I are gonna reassess the tooth head situation and see where everyone stands." She withdrew. The fire extinguisher stayed where it was. "So champ," she said. "Tell me what you know."</div></div>

"I learned your real name," he said gradually, "after consulting your file at the police station, which contains a full description of the crime you have committed as well as your--"<br><br>"Oh my god seriously you are the worst liar ever," Channery observed, cutting him off. "Wait, so, did they -- did they actually go in and like, drill the lying parts out of your brain, or what? Are you some kind of truth cyborg? 'Cause it looks like you're <i>really</i> going against your programming, here, slinging all this bullshit my way."<br><br>"Don't say that!" Renard managed to sputter.<br><br>"What? 'Bullshit'?"<br><br>"Oh, please don't say that word again. I can't stand to hear young women using such <i>malodorant</i> language. It breaks my heart..."<br><br>He was expecting her to tease him for his old-fashioned perspective, perhaps to repeat the word a few times at increasing volumes, or even to string together an array of utterances more profane and <i>choquant</i> still, but she did not. Instead she studied him for a moment, biting her lip, and then relaxed the fire extinguisher slightly. "All right, I can respect that," she said eventually. "Let's see... Your lies are so stupid, insubstantial, and actually <i>physically disgusting</i>... that the only way I can describe them is by way of comparison to excrement. Better?"<br><br>"<i>Oui, merci.</i>"<br><br>"Bear with me. I'm not that eloquent."<br><br>Renard imagined that he caught a hint of a smile on Channery's face with these last words, but he found it hard to reciprocate as he pressed on: "But what makes you suppose I'm lying?"<br><br>"Well," she said. "The police aren't on to me, that's what. You've met Williams, I assume." At his nod, she continued. "Now see, if Williams had even the slightest idea what'd happened, I'd already be in a striped suit dragging around a ball and chain. He doesn't really <i>do</i> the whole subtlety... <i>thing</i>." She paused. "Especially not with people like me."<br><br>In the doorway, the dog Micmac yawned. Despite this frightening <i>etalage</i> of teeth it seemed to have relaxed somewhat, no doubt in tandem with its mistress. The rain continued.<br><br>"So you're not with the police, you're totally harmless, and you found me some other way.

"<i>Mademoiselle,</i> I would be happy to oblige, but my throat has grown regrettably somewhat parched. Is it possible I could trouble you for a glass of something to set the tongue wagging? Cognac, perhaps?"<br><br>Channery laughed aloud. "Oh wow," she said. "I don't know who you're giving more undue credit with a line like that."<br><br>"What do you mean?" he asked as he accepted the plastic bottle of water that had appeared in her hand.<br><br>"I mean I don't know whether you're giving <i>me</i> too much credit for thinking I'd have something like cognac on hand... no, buddy, pull the little thing up--" (Renard stopped trying to unscrew the dark green cap and instead pulled the little thing up) "--or <i>you</i> too much credit for thinking I'd give it to you if I had it." She reached out and tipped the bottle up in his hands. "Now just pretend it's a wine bottle and you're too pathetic to use a glass, come on, this is easy."<br><br>Sure enough in a moment cool water was trickling into Renard's mouth and he marvelled at yet another minor yet <i>ingenieux</i> application of plastic. Channery let the fire extinguisher drop to her side and stood up. She offered a hand to assist Renard in standing as well. She pointed to one of the plush chairs in front of the television and he sat obediently, taking another sip from the plastic bottle of water.<br><br>"Now then," said Channery.<br><br>"Yes," he said.<br><br>"Let's start with your name. Level the playing field a little."<br><br>"My name," he said for the final time that day, except possibly when he would call the Winstone police department later although that is a brief conversation which we will be able to skip over without harming the narrative, "is Renard Rouletabille."<br><br>"You don't say. And here I had you pegged for a Spaniard. That was sarcasm," she added quickly in response to his look, "you don't need to correct it. So, Rules. How'd you find me?"<br><br>Renard considered this question over another swallow from the plastic bottle of water. "I suppose it was when I noticed you on the... Well, today we passed each other in the parking lot of Albarello, as I'm sure you must...? <i>Oui</i>. You see, later on I was watching the security footage from the Gallery of Art, the day before the burglary, and I couldn't help but recognize you there, looking at the..." He trailed off. Channery had grabbed the golf club once again. The Caucasian shepherd had snapped to attention. Renard recoiled in his chair slightly.<br><br>"Is this going where I think it's going?" she demanded.<br><br>"I'm, ah, not quite sure where you think it's going, Mlle. Keigler..."<br><br>"Allheal."<br><br>Renard understood after a second. "Well, yes," he admitted. "I <i>did</i> pay a visit to Madame Mangjeol later in the day... I was simply curious because she'd left her name in the visitor's log and I thought that..."<br><br>Channery was shaking her head, looking away toward the wide window. She mouthed a word which looked somewhat like "pitch" although this would have been an <i>insolite</i> interjection at this moment.<br><br>"What does she know about me?"<br><br>"Altogether, not much," Renard said immediately. He had already abandoned the possibility of pretending that Mme. Mangjeol had told him anything more than he currently knew. Channery's capacity for lie detection had so far proven uncanny. "Your name... not your address, I had to find that myself... a connection to the Giarrettiera family... implication in perhaps some petty shoplifting cases here and there..."<br><br>"My power?"<br><br>"<i>Excusez-moi</i>?"<br><br>"Does she know what my power is?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>Channery had fixed him with a puzzled glare. "And you didn't <i>tell</i> her what my power is?"<br><br>Renard fixed her with an equally puzzled glare. "I don't know what your power is."<br><br>Insistently: "Yes you do."<br><br>Resolute in ignorance: "<i>Mademoiselle,</i> I do not."<br><br>"Oh, Christ, seriously?" Channery rubbed her forehead. "I mean, really? Didn't I show you on the dock? What about the pipe? What about the <i>everything else</i> oh my god Rules don't tell me you're this dumb."<br><br>Renard chose to ignore the insult. "If you could spare a more comprehensive demonstration," he said coldly, "I would greatly appreciate it, <i>mademoiselle</i> Keigler."<br><div class="quote" timestamp="1277951737" source="/post/56372/thread" author="@evilbiscuit"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-85" title="The Evil Biscuit"><img src="http://i153.photobucket.com/albums/s217/evilbiscuit/kaiseravatar-1.jpg" alt="The Evil Biscuit Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/56372/thread"><abbr data-timestamp="1277951737000" class="o-timestamp time" title="Jun 30, 2010 16:35:37 GMT -5">Jun 30, 2010 16:35:37 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/85" class="user-link user-85 group-11" itemprop="url" title="@evilbiscuit"><span itemprop="name">The Evil Biscuit</span></a></span> said:</div>DEMAND TO KNOW THE SECRET OF HER ABILITY<div class="quote_clear"></div></div></div><br>"Fine," Channery said immediately.

A very faint pattern of light in the shape of a handprint had briefly come into existence on his coat where Channery had touched his shoulder. Then the coat disappeared and he flinched quite a bit more violently. He looked frantically at Channery. She was holding the coat by one shoulder with her right hand.<br><br>"It's not rocket science, Rules," she said.<br><div class="quote" timestamp="1278122487" source="/post/56435/thread" author="@admin"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-1" title="LeeTupper" style="border-color: #FFFFFF;"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v202/LeeTupper/New%20avatar_zpsuph1bjm6.png" alt="LeeTupper Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/56435/thread"><abbr title="Jul 2, 2010 16:01:27 GMT -5" class="o-timestamp time" data-timestamp="1278122487000">Jul 2, 2010 16:01:27 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/1" class="user-link user-1 group-1" itemprop="url" title="@admin" style="color: #FFFFFF;"><span itemprop="name">LeeTupper</span></a></span> said:</div>Declare yourself to be a fan of hers.<div class="quote_clear"></div></div></div><br>Renard fell back onto the plush chair, his <i>epoustouflant</i> mind reeling. To say that he understood everything would have been a dire overstatement but it was eminently fair to say that his comprehension of the situation had taken a leap forward. The burglary of the Boullogne came down to this, then. One (probably faked) loss of balance, one steadying palm, and <i>Le roi Midas</i> had been hers. No trace of a break-in? Nothing on the cameras but the painting's instantaneous disappearance? What else could they have expected? And of course Mlle. Keigler had only stolen one painting. She wouldn't have dared to go around pawing every work of art in the Gallery. Even the Commissioner and the Inspector would have noticed.<br><br>The unexplained cases of shoplifting? But of course she had been the common factor! The incident on the docks? She'd set the notes up exactly as she had with the knowledge that she could withdraw the painting at any time she liked! The <i>pipe</i>, even? A dirty trick. But a very impressive one.<br><br>Renard drew in his breath slowly. She was rummaging through his coat pockets. "<i>Mademoiselle</i>," he said at length, "you have an astonishing talent..."<br><br>"'S okay," she said. She was flipping inattentively through his notebook. Evidently she couldn't read French. She tucked the notebook back in and took out the rainbow-colored metallic disk. She <i>oisivement</i> snapped the rainbow-colored metallic disk in half and dropped both halves into a small plastic dustbin beside one bookcase. He attempted to protest, but not quite vocally enough. She procured the knife. "What's this?" she asked. "A <i>butter knife</i>? Is this -- This isn't for self-defense, is it? Are you kidding me?"<br><br>Renard took a closer look. Why, a butter knife it was. He was sure he had taken a small yet capable serrated bread knife with him from the kitchen! Ah, well, he'd been a bit hasty this morning, perhaps.<br><br>"Actually I guess you could take someone's eyeball out with this," Channery said upon further reflection, holding the knife up to the light. "I mean, <i>you</i> couldn't. You're a pushover. <i>I</i> could. Maybe. Never tried it but I feel like it's a pretty simple concept. Kind of..." She stabbed the butter knife forward in the air and made a scooping twist. Renard pressed himself as far back into his seat as possible. "Kind of like that. I don't know. Whatever." <br><br>She returned the butter knife to the inner coat pocket and moved on to the outer ones. "Oh look at you," she said upon discovering the magnifying glass and the various glass evidence tubes. "Sherlock Holmes! You're really doing this up old school, huh Rules?" Completely at a loss, he nodded faintly. "Good for you, boss. Keep the old stories... oh. Wait. <i>Hold up.</i>"<br><br>And hold something up she did. The folding camera, to be precise.<br><br>"Hold <i>up</i>," she breathed. "Stop! Look at this thing. Amazing, I didn't even know they <i>made</i> these anymore!"<br><br>Renard brightened. "Ah!" he said. "Yes, well. It's quite old, as I'm sure you can imagine..."<br><br>"A <i>museum piece</i>," she clarified. "And it still works? God, this thing is awesome! How does it even--? Okay so you just swing this down and pull the lens out..." Renard was momentarily afraid she was going to break it as casually as she had the VDV, but this was not the case. In fact she fiddled with dexterity and care that a master mechanic would have been able to appreciate. "Jesus how did they know how to <i>make</i> these back then? I'm so used to digital, I can't even imagine... This is some camera, Rules!"</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Renard watched Channery drop down onto one of the plush chairs in front of the coffee table, scrutinizing the folding camera. "Little loose here," she muttered of one of the mechanical joints. "Let me just..." And a screwdriver appeared in her hand. <i>Non, justement,</i> she hadn't used her power that time; she had simply pulled it out of one of the pockets in her trousers. She rested the camera on its side upon the marble surface and set about re-securing the screw in question. "There," she said fondly. She held the camera up and collapsed and expanded it a few times. Renard might have taken greater issue with a stranger handling one of his possessions but this was a different case. Actually, seeing his beloved old camera give such delight to a young person put an idea into Renard's head that was superficially painful and yet, in some sweet way, felt correct.<br><div class="quote" author="@admin" timestamp="1278526179" source="/post/56600/thread"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-1" title="LeeTupper" style="border-color: #FFFFFF;"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v202/LeeTupper/New%20avatar_zpsuph1bjm6.png" alt="LeeTupper Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/56600/thread"><abbr data-timestamp="1278526179000" class="o-timestamp time" title="Jul 7, 2010 8:09:39 GMT -5">Jul 7, 2010 8:09:39 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/1" class="user-link user-1 group-1" itemprop="url" title="@admin" style="color: #FFFFFF;"><span itemprop="name">LeeTupper</span></a></span> said:</div>Offer to trade the camera for the Boullogne.<div class="quote_clear"></div></div></div><br>"<i>Mademoiselle,</i>" he said, straightening up in his chair, "I wish to make a proposal. I will give this camera to you if, in exchange, you will return <i>Le roi Midas</i> to the Gallery of Art where it rightfully belongs."<br><br>He leaned forward, eagerly awaiting her response in the affirmative to this <i>offre genereuse</i>. She had to see the emotional investment behind his words. The camera had been his only one for decades and it meant so much to him yet the return of the burgled Boullogne would be worth any cost.<br><br>"Oh the camera's mine," she replied brightly. He blinked. "Oho. <i>Please.</i> This camera isn't going anywhere. It is <i>way</i> too cool." He started to raise his voice in protest. She pushed on. "Sorry, Rules, but your stuff's forfeit. You knew the risks when you took the job... of... breaking into my house." She pulled out the lockpick which she had discovered in her earlier rummagings through the overcoat. "Speaking of, I think I'm gonna hold onto this too. Always wanted one. Nice guy like you really shouldn't be snooping around anyway." She dropped it into one pocket of her trousers along with the screwdriver. Renard was too <i>deprime</i> by the loss of the folding camera to give the lockpick a second thought.<br><br>"I suppose," he said sullenly, "now that you have touched it, it's yours anyway, is it not? As is everything you've ever touched."<br><br>For some reason his hurt tone failed to elicit an apology from Channery, who had returned to studying the folding camera from all angles. "Nah, not really." She took her first successful photograph with the camera, a portrait of the dog Micmac, who bore himself nobly up for the occasion. The camera whirred in obedience. "Thing is, I can't retrieve anything if I don't know <i>where</i> it is. Basically. Like I have to, you know, visualize its location and be pretty accurate." She snapped a picture of Renard, who squinted against the flash. "That's how it works. I think. There's no user's manual for Powers, can you believe that?"<br><br>Renard had averted his eyes in case she photographed him again but this proved to be the perfect opportunity to reinspect the living room in light of this new information. He cast his gaze again around the color-coded bookshelves, the alphabetically sorted VDVs, the pictures assigned to walls by subject, the geometric arrangements of vases and chairs and (this evening at least) flashlights... Someone who could instantaneously retrieve anything she had ever touched could afford to live in conditions, if anything, even more <i>salissant</i> and cluttered than Renard's own. Someone who was constrained to retrieve only objects she could locate in her mind's eye might easily find her lifestyle shifting in the other direction.<br><div class="quote" timestamp="1278883318" source="/post/56647/thread" author="@ninety"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-66" title="Ninety"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/y5MlxQ8.jpg" alt="Ninety Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/56647/thread"><abbr data-timestamp="1278883318000" title="Jul 11, 2010 11:21:58 GMT -5" class="o-timestamp time">Jul 11, 2010 11:21:58 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/66" class="user-link user-66 group-0" itemprop="url" title="@ninety"><span itemprop="name">Ninety</span></a></span> said:</div>Ask her what she intends to do with you.<div class="quote_clear"></div></div></div><br>An ugly possibility had stalked into his thoughts.<br><br>"Why do you feel at liberty to tell me these things?" he asked in a low voice. "And, <i>s'il vous plait</i>, do not respond that you're only letting me in on the secret because you pity my stupidity. Do you intend to kill me once you're satisfied I've understood?"<br><br>Channery gaped at him for a moment, her mouth open but wordless.<br><br>Then: "What? <i>Kill you</i>? What are you -- No! Jesus!" She raised her hands by her sides, fingers splayed, in an exaggerated show of peace. "Hey, come on. What the fuck, Rules? Sorry. But you think I want to have to deal with a dead body right now?"<br><br>"That's not quite... the <i>most</i> reassuring way you could have phrased that answer, <i>mademoiselle</i>..."<br><br>"Okay. I'm not killing you. Neither's Micmac. Better?" Channery folded her arms. "So since I'm not allowed to pity your stupidity, here's another reason. I don't care if you know how I did it <i>because</i>, drum roll please, I'm at the airport in a little over an hour. After that I'm on the way home. And knowing Williams as we both do, I kinda doubt he's interested in making this an international pursuit." Her gaze dropped to his feet. "You walking back to the city? Maybe I should take your shoes and socks too... slow you down a little extra... Nah, too mean. See, Rules? We're friends now, look at us. I'm trying not to be mean to you!"<br><br>At her pause, Renard was finally able to get an accusation in edgewise. "But there <i>is</i> no airport in Winstone!" he cried. "Mlle. Keigler, I am calling <i>maintenant</i> your bovine fecal matter which is comparable to excrement!"<br><br>Channery rolled her eyes.<br><br>"<i>Rules</i>," she said. "I am only going to be not mean to you if you quit saying dumb things. This is Johto. Gimme a bike I could get to any other city in the region in like a half hour. Besides you <i>know</i> I'm flying out tonight. What do you think this is for?"<br><br>And in her right hand she held up a sheet of paper which had not been there an instant before. A logo with an iconic depiction of an airplane topped the page, followed by a dense amount of small text accompanied by six letters and digits printed in large block letters and a bar code. The most <i>frappant</i> detail was that the two bottom corners of the sheet had been torn away. Renard recognized the paper instantly, although he had never before seen this part of it. Though his coat was still on the marble coffee table, he did not need to retrieve the two scraps of paper bearing Channery's handwriting to surmise that this sheet of paper would be complete with two additions:<br><br><hr><blockquote><font face="Arial"><div align="right">omplete rules for the payment of<br>rities are available at all airport ticket<br>cations.

What do they mean?!<div class="quote_clear"></div></div></div><br>Yes all right <i>sheesh!</i><br><br>"The photographs," he continued, "are -- are for the benefit of..."<br><br>Channery nodded. "Yeah? Go on, warlord. What are they for the benefit of?"<br><br>Renard snapped up in his seat. He had it. "Permitting you to move <i>a l'etranger</i> for an extended period of time without the burden of moving your possessions overseas! You need merely consult your collection of photographs and you may call any item in this house instantly to your residence out of the country!"<br><br>"Oh my god <i>bingo!</i> There we go, Rules. Smart friends! Up top." She leaned forward in her chair and stretched out one hand to him, the palm flat against the air. He blinked. She wavered. "Just... Just raise your hand like this," she added. He raised his hand like that. She thrust her hand forward and fetched him an <i>urticant</i> strike on his palm with her own. He slumped in his seat, rubbing the smarting skin. "Sorry," she said. "Little rough. I'm sorry."<br><br>But the pain was of no concern. Renard was already forgetting about it. The square tables, side by side, on which rested the Albarello bag, had taken on a new meaning. So too had the small boxy bookshelves. And the multiple miniature refrigerators placed in a row in the kitchen. "Your power," he said. "May I hazard a guess as to the <i>plafonnements</i> placed upon its usage?"<br><br>"The pluffy what?"<br><br>"Ah, excuse me..." Renard cast around for the right English word. "The -- The limits, or shall I say restraints... the <i>boundaries</i> perhaps, upon your ability?"<br><br>"Oh. Right." Channery leaned back and crossed her arms. "Hazard away."<br><br>"Well then, I must venture that you may not retrieve items too large or heavy for you to carry without assistance. Hence the--"<br><br>But she cut him off. "Awesome, Rules! Look at you! <i>Such</i> smart friends. That's exactly how my power works. You are doing Lupin proud, buddy!"<br><br>Renard was too pleased by the look on her face to point out that she was more likely to be considered a spiritual successor to Lupin than he and that this was no more than three quarters a compliment. Furthermore he remained more than a bit <i>perplexe</i> at how freely she was betraying this information. He could not help but wonder whether the fact that she would soon depart the Archipelago was not her only line of reasoning here.<br><br>Another question however had occurred to him. "And shall I presume that any attempt to retrieve an object too enormous for your grasp would yield only whichever part of that object you had touched, given that the object could be broken down into discrete components?"<br><br>Channery chuckled a little and twisted one strand of hair, which Renard noticed for the first time was still mildly wet from the rain. "I hear you," she said. <br><br>It was not difficult to envision. A brief moment was all Renard needed to see her standing on the drenched docks of Winstone's eastern end, facing his small black automobile. He was elsewhere along the row of garages, distracted. She reached out and pressed a palm against the driver's window. Her hand dropped, the handprint glowed faintly, and the sheet of glass was neatly detached. She slipped <i>Le roi Midas</i> onto the passenger's seat along with the two torn-out scraps from the sheet of paper with flight-related information. Then, before retreating into the sleek silver Corvette, she took hold of his steering wheel and sundered it from the automobile with the same motion.<br><br>These were the same sheet of glass and steering wheel which now appeared in her hands, and which she set on the marble coffee table beside the folding camera. Then she said in a low voice, "Another point to you."<br><br>And this scene had brought another recollection to Renard. "Let me attempt to score one additional point," he said. "When I arrived here I saw no Corvette in your garage. I took this to indicate you were not home. I should have known I was incorrect, <i>non</i>? For the same bicycle which I spied in your garage was the one you'd stored in the backseat while driving around earlier, was it not? And does this not mean your final errand today was to deposit the Corvette in storage for the length of time you'd be abroad, and you brought the bicycle along for easy and inexpensive transportation home?"<br><br>At first Channery didn't speak. She instead busied herself with the demanding task of scratching the dog Micmac behind the ears. He yawned, once again revealing that gruesome <i>gueule</i>, but afterward fixed the detective with another affable and unconcerned look. "Aw, <i>Jesus</i>, Rules," Channery said at length. "You've really got it all figured out, huh."<br><br>"Not quite all of it. Putting aside for one moment the matter of <i>Le roi Midas</i>' current whereabouts, and remaining for one final beat upon the subject of your returning overseas this evening, I also find myself fairly curious as to what you intend to do with the house itself. Will you simply leave it here, abandoned, once you have extracted all your possessions thence?"<br><br>"Why? Thinking of movin' in?" Channery grinned wryly. "Nope, nothing doing, sorry Rules. I've already arranged things with the Giarrettieras. They're selling the house for me within the week. Good thing about the Don is he doesn't ask too many questions."<br><br><i>What was I saying? Oh yes. Miss Keigler also does business, or at least</i> has <i>done business, with the Giarrettiera family...</i><br><br>"Yes, Madame Mangjeol told me," said Renard. "I mean, the fact you had professional ties of some kind to the organization. Her knowledge about you extended that far, at any rate."<br><br>"Hmm? Oh, yeah, well." Channery appeared to think about it for a moment while rubbing Micmac's chin, then shook her head. "No, yeah, guess I don't really care if Mangjeol knows that. I run deliveries for 'em. They took a liking to me once they figured out I can get stuff right from point A to point B without the <i>stuff</i> actually having to be... you know, en route." She pronounced the <i>en</i> as if sounding out the letter <i>N</i> but Renard did not protest. "I don't think what went on at the hotel changed my standing with 'em. The Don knows he owes me a favor."<br><br>"I see."<br><br>Channery regarded him appraisingly. "You ever met the Don?"<br><br>"<i>Non.</i>"<br><br>"Want to?"<br><br>"Well, ah..." Renard shifted his feet and leaned on one elbow of the chair. "I don't mean him any disrespect, but no, I suspect I could rest easy the balance of my life without ever meeting Don Giarrettiera..."<br><br>Channery smiled cheerily. "Good! Then do yourself a favor and don't tell the cops where I live." The golf club was back in her hand. "Cause if it turns out the police get their hands on my property, the Don's gonna be as pissed as I am." She propped the golf club up vertically while continuing to pet Micmac with the other hand. "And I can't -- you know, I can't guarantee you'll meet him <i>personal</i>... But I'm pretty sure you oughta be able to expect a couple of copper jackets shipped to your skull with all his fondest."<br><br>Renard waned.<br><div class="quote" author="@admin" timestamp="1277698610" source="/post/56282/thread"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-1" title="LeeTupper" style="border-color: #FFFFFF;"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v202/LeeTupper/New%20avatar_zpsuph1bjm6.png" alt="LeeTupper Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/56282/thread"><abbr class="o-timestamp time" title="Jun 27, 2010 18:16:50 GMT -5" data-timestamp="1277698610000">Jun 27, 2010 18:16:50 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/1" class="user-link user-1 group-1" itemprop="url" title="@admin" style="color: #FFFFFF;"><span itemprop="name">LeeTupper</span></a></span> said:</div>Tweak mustache in consternation, to buy a moment of thinking time.<div class="quote_clear"></div></div></div><br>He tweaked his moustache in the manner of one who had felt the <i>haleine froide</i> of sinister consequences eroding one's resolve to pursue one's originally intended course of action.<br><br>"C'mon Rules.

That's big."<br><br>Something in the way she looked at him then informed the detective that she meant it. But: "What <i>can</i> I tell them then?" Renard asked, aware even himself of how pouty the question sounded.<br><br>Channery's lips pulled back in thought.

Unzipped the cover, took a good long look at the brushwork or whatever, zipped up the cover, paid, hoisted the painting into their car and took off. Oh and talked a lot. Throughout that whole little sequence."<br><br>"So that's... they are now the ones who possess <i>Le roi Midas</i>?" Renard inquired with some disappointment, but the devious light in Channery's eyes was already beginning to inform him otherwise.<br><br>"Rules," she said. "Are we smart friends, or what are we exactly?"<br><br>Renard's eyebrows rose.<br><br>"Put it this way," explained Channery. "I had until their car rounded the corner to figure out whether I wanted to do the honorable thing or the clever thing. And I thought what the eff, I wasn't taking the high road in the first place..."<br><br>She stood up and spread her arms wide with a smile.<br><br><i>Le roi Midas</i> materialized before her, her hands gripping opposite sides of the frame. <br><br>It was oriented to face Renard. There again he saw the bedraggled King Midas on the bank of the river, immersing his knobby hands in the water. There again the branches of bright green that overhung his form, some of the shrubbery gilded, perhaps where he had stumbled on his approach. There again the concentric ripples of gold across the sand from where his fingertips had touched the bottom, and there again too Midas' expression of wonder and disbelief and <i>extase</i>. <br><br>"I wonder if they've unzipped the cover again yet," said Channery.</div></div>

Think of the bright-eyed child in the Winstone Gallery of Art whom <i>Le roi Midas</i>, and no other painting, might inspire to take up a career as an artist!

Yet <i>mundane</i> objects, which harbor no muse! A clock, a chandelier, a precious jewel… a computer…” He tweaked his moustache not so much for optimum effect as to spar for time while he tried to add to the list, but these examples were enough to be going on with. “In the theft of any of these objects, you steal from the body of mankind but not from its mind, for they offer humanity nothing a thousand others of their ilk could not replicate. But in burgling works of art, <i>mademoiselle</i>, you plunder from the vault of human intellect itself. Such wrongdoing cannot be set right until <i>Le roi Midas</i> is hanging once again in a public gallery where all people may draw inspiration from it. And that is why I cannot depart this house without that same painting under my arm!”<br><br>He finished this tirade with an index finger a bit absurdly jutting out into the air, which he retracted feebly.

She picked up the coat in the normal human way and handed it to him. He gratefully slipped it back upon his person, welcoming the heaviness and bulkiness without which he had felt quite at sea for the better part of this <i>tete-a-tete</i>. “I’m keeping the camera and the lockpick though. Hope you’re cool with that.”<br><br>Renard took one more long look at the antique folding camera, his companion of so many years, but then smiled and nodded. “Treat the camera well,” he said to her. “May it last long enough to bring you as much <i>jouissance</i> as it did to me.”<br><br>“Thanks, pal.”<br><div class="quote" author="@ninety" timestamp="1278883318" source="/post/56647/thread"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-66" title="Ninety"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/y5MlxQ8.jpg" alt="Ninety Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/56647/thread"><abbr class="o-timestamp time" title="Jul 11, 2010 11:21:58 GMT -5" data-timestamp="1278883318000">Jul 11, 2010 11:21:58 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/66" class="user-link user-66 group-0" itemprop="url" title="@ninety"><span itemprop="name">Ninety</span></a></span> said:</div>Ask if you can smoke.<div class="quote_clear"></div></div></div><br>“I would also not mind being able to have a smoke on the way back into the city,” he put forth. “If I could just…”<br><br>“Shit!

In Channery’s hand, meanwhile, the blue backpack materialized once again. She unzipped the main compartment and stuffed the photographs from Albarello back in at the top. Then she slung the backpack over her shoulders. In another second a long green leash dangled from her hands. “C’mon, Micmac,” she said. She hooked the leash onto Micmac’s collar, but the beast hastened over to Renard and licked his hands vigorously, covering them with spittle.<br><div class="quote" author="@ninety" source="/post/56267/thread" timestamp="1277665429"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-66" title="Ninety"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/y5MlxQ8.jpg" alt="Ninety Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/56267/thread"><abbr class="o-timestamp time" title="Jun 27, 2010 9:03:49 GMT -5" data-timestamp="1277665429000">Jun 27, 2010 9:03:49 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/66" class="user-link user-66 group-0" itemprop="url" title="@ninety"><span itemprop="name">Ninety</span></a></span> said:</div>Forgive it since it's so gosh darn lovable.<div class="quote_clear"></div></div></div><br>Renard forgave Micmac since he was so gosh darn lovable.<br><div class="quote" timestamp="1279069290" source="/post/56695/thread" author="@ninety"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-66" title="Ninety"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/y5MlxQ8.jpg" alt="Ninety Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/56695/thread"><abbr data-timestamp="1279069290000" title="Jul 13, 2010 15:01:30 GMT -5" class="o-timestamp time">Jul 13, 2010 15:01:30 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/66" class="user-link user-66 group-0" itemprop="url" title="@ninety"><span itemprop="name">Ninety</span></a></span> said:</div>Ask if you can take care of doggy while she's gone. You're old and lonely and destitute.<div class="quote_clear"></div></div></div><br>“Likes you, does he,” Channery observed. Micmac wagged his enormous tail. “You know I don’t really know how he’ll deal with spending a whole night on board a plane.”<br><br>“You cannot leave him here overnight and retrieve him when you arrive?” Renard asked while giving Micmac a stout scratching behind the ears.<br><br>“No go.” Channery held up her hands. “Doesn’t work on living things. Besides, look at the <i>size</i> of that monster. You know I can’t fetch stuff that’s too big.” She reached down to stroke Micmac’s back. “He’s never been out of the Archipelago. Guess I’m worried the flight’ll mess him up.”<br><br>Renard hesitated before suggesting, “You know, <i>mademoiselle</i>, I would be willing to host Micmac for the duration of your stay abroad if this might <i>apaiser</i> one of your worries…”<br><br>Although she clearly had the option of scoffing at this idea, Channery surprisingly did not. <br><br>She stared at Renard and Micmac for a moment before inquiring, “Ever owned a dog, Rules?”<br><br>“Yes actually, I was in possession of a French bulldog for a number of years,” said Renard, remembering the dear departed Passepartout (old age).<br><br>Channery frowned. “Beginner level,” she said eventually, “but good enough I guess. What do you think, Micmac? Wanna spend some time with the clumsy French guy?” Micmac responded by panting loudly and wetly with what appeared to be a wide grin. “Okay. You’re on. One less thing for me to worry about.” The next items to appear in her hands were a pencil and a notebook, full-sized rather than pocket-sized like Renard’s. The paper was yellow. “Gimme your number,” she said, “and I’ll call you tomorrow afternoon, tell you what you need to get for him.”<br><br>Renard obediently wrote his number upon the top page and handed it back to her before thinking to mention that his phone was out of service.<br><br>“Oh Christ, Rules, really?” The notepad and pencil disappeared from his grasp. She tore the top page off, placed it in her backpack, and then started writing herself. “Fix that okay? And then call me and we’ll get you up to speed. Here. For now.” She tore the next page off and gave it to him. In addition to a phone number, the sheet also included brief counsel on diet and other daily habits.<br><br>“Thank you,” he said plainly.<br><br>“Forget it,” she said. “Helping me really. What’s that, Micmac? You don’t wanna go on a scary plane and tremble and shake and throw up all night? <i>I didn’t think so.</i>” She knelt down and hugged the dog. He rested his chin on her shoulder and applied a liberal amount of spittle to that surface as well. She stood up. “Treat him well, all right?” she told Renard. “May he last long enough to bring you as much whatever the hell you said.”<br><br>“<i>Merci beaucoup.</i>”<br><br>“Oh. And.” Channery paused. Then something else appeared in her hand. It was a wad of bills. She dropped them into his hand without comment. However then before he could get more than a syllable out she quietly cut him off. “Shut <i>up</i> okay. I’m not being generous. ’S for the window and the steering wheel. That was a dick move, you shouldn’t have to pay for it. Besides, you're gonna need a lot of chow for garbage disposal over there.”<br><br>Renard understood and he squirrelled away the wad of bills without even incurring the discourtesy of counting them then and there, but he guessed the amount to be somewhere in the high hundreds. His fingers felt almost electrified. It had been a very long time since he had handled this much money at once. He hoped Channery preferred he express his gratitude <i>en le non-dit</i>.<br><br>Channery exited the living room into the hallway and opened the front door. “Oh good,” she said, “it stopped raining.” Indeed, though the clouds had not yet cleared, the rain had passed. The evening was very warm and very humid. Renard stepped out of the house after her, carrying the painting under one arm and taking Micmac’s leash by the other hand. He and the dog stepped off the front porch to allow her to lock the door, after which she opened the garage door and went inside. Renard took a deep breath. The garden was full of <i>fraises</i> scents. Channery wheeled out the bicycle, slammed the garage door and locked it as well. “All set,” she declared. “You walking, Rules?”<br><br>“I suppose so.”<br><br>“Good. You could use the exercise,” she said. <br><br>She offered a hand. Renard rather jerkily stuck out his hand while still pressing the portrait against his hip with that elbow. She shook it.<br><br>“Take care of yourself, Rules.”<br><br>“And you, Mlle. Keigler,” Renard replied. “I am very sorry for breaking into your house. I shall not replace the lockpick. My days of such snooping are past.”<br><br>“Well good. <i>Man,</i>” she said. “No, I’m joking. I forgive you. And I’m sorry about… well, robbin’ the vault of human knowledge or whatever – but also about… You know. Losing my temper. Didn’t need to shout at you.”<br><br>Renard shook his head. “Don’t mention it.”<br><div class="quote" author="@admin" timestamp="1279892505" source="/post/56917/thread"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-1" title="LeeTupper" style="border-color: #FFFFFF;"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v202/LeeTupper/New%20avatar_zpsuph1bjm6.png" alt="LeeTupper Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/56917/thread"><abbr class="o-timestamp time" title="Jul 23, 2010 3:41:45 GMT -5" data-timestamp="1279892505000">Jul 23, 2010 3:41:45 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/1" class="user-link user-1 group-1" itemprop="url" title="@admin" style="color: #FFFFFF;"><span itemprop="name">LeeTupper</span></a></span> said:</div>Suggest going after more innocuous (and less innocent) targets, because you know that whenever a case turns up in the paper, you'll be there to try and solve it.<div class="quote_clear"></div></div></div><br>The backpack swung heavily as she got onto the bicycle. “How long are you going to be abroad?” he asked.<br><br>“About a year, probably,” said Channery. “Gonna give this time to blow over, plus I have some stuff to take care of over there.

Micmac whined gently. “Off we go, then,” Renard muttered. He started down the driveway. Micmac followed behind for only a few paces before excitedly plowing ahead. Renard almost lost his balance and dropped the painting as he stumbled down to the bottom of the driveway in tow of the massive dog. “<i>Steady</i> now, Micmac,” he said. When they were on level ground again the brute slowed. Yet he still trotted a bit ahead of Renard as they wandered out of the neighborhood in search of the nearest phone booth.<br></div></div>

Renard seized the leash with both hands and tried to hold on while the Boullogne slipped <i>perilleuxment</i> down his side. He was certain the enormous dog would set to running in a second, at which point Renard would fly along comically behind him like a kite and <i>Le roi Midas</i> would be left in a puddle. But as soon as Micmac detected resistance from Renard's end, he stopped in his tracks, one paw lifted in the act of stepping over the curb onto the lawn where the cat had fled, and looked back at the detective. Then the Caucasian shepherd returned to the lamp-lit street and trotted on as if there wasn't a cat in the world. Renard silently praised Mlle.

Say that you've done all the hunting for him, and the painting has been secured.<div class="quote_clear"></div></div></div><br>So that was the second location he called. There followed a brief conversation with a lower officer which we will be able to skip over without harming the narrative. You'll notice during the Channery scene it does in fact say that when Renard introduced himself he did so "for the final time that day, except possibly when he would call the Winstone police department later although that is a brief conversation which we will be able to skip over without harming the narrative." Suffice it to say that shortly thereafter a police car arrived with the lights off to transport the detective, the dog and the painting back to the station.<br><br>* * *<br><br>Renard sat in a stark wooden chair, one of two sitting in front of the unoccupied desk. <i>Le roi Midas</i> had been placed in the other chair. Micmac was sprawled upon the black carpet near the door, staring contentedly at nothing. The walls and ceiling were white and very sparsely decorated. A black bookcase, stuffed with notebooks, plastic binders, videocasettes and VDVs, stood perpendicular to the chaotically papered desk -- which was, in fact, untidy enough to look more at home in Renard's apartment than Channery's house. Only one corner of the desk resisted the <i>marmalade</i> of documents and envelopes, and that was merely to accommodate a single framed picture angled away from Renard and toward the desk's absent occupant.<br><br>Renard could not help himself. He'd already turned one picture around today to have a glimpse at it. The thing was starting to become a habit. He rotated the picture to face him. Depicted were two very young colored girls, the older no more than six and wearing a sunny yellow dress, the younger perhaps four and bedecked in pink. They were sitting hand-in-hand on a stone bench beside a lake; something which might have been a tackle box poked in by the older girl's feet. Both had fixed the photographer with gap-toothed, round-cheeked grins.<br><br>The doorknob turned. Micmac shot to his feet. The door opened and Commissioner Perry Williams started in. "I hear you -- <i>Oh my god</i>," he said. This hasty revision of his introductory comment was designed to take into account the fact that Micmac, having apparently sensed that he'd finally come face-to-face with a human being of sufficient strength and girth to weather a full-on <i>abordage</i>, had reared up onto his hind legs and planted those two beefy paws upon his shoulders. The Commissioner staggered back a couple of steps but otherwise bore the attack admirably. He spluttered in indignation as the dog leaned his muzzle in for an eager lick.<br><br>"Get <i>down!</i>" he spat out. Micmac promptly dropped back down onto the floor. "Is this your dog, Rouletabille?" Williams demanded.<br><br>Renard surprised himself. "<i>Ah... oui</i>," he admitted.<br><br>"I don't host animals in here."<br><br>"Excuse me! I had no idea..."<br><br>The Commissioner might have pressed the matter further if Micmac had not pressed his snout into the man's hand. The Commissioner's brow softened as he scratched Micmac's thick coat of fur. "Naw, forget it," he said. He wiped his face with his other sleeve. "God. I thought at first he was a <i>grizzly</i>." He looked back at Renard, and then at the desk.<br><br>"Messing up my possessions. Noted, Rouletabille."<br><br>After a moment's misunderstanding, Renard realized he'd left the picture of the two little girls facing him. His eyes widened and he hastened to <i>reparer</i> the mistake but the Commissioner's sturdy fingers plucked the frame from his own. "I'll get it," said Williams unnecessarily. He sat down at his desk, still holding the picture, and set a grim glare upon Renard. "And I <i>truly</i> hope that's the only thing in this office you touched, Rouletabille. I'll be consulting the cameras to investigate that."<br><div class="quote" author="@evilbiscuit" source="/post/53578/thread" timestamp="1270928145"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-85" title="The Evil Biscuit"><img src="http://i153.photobucket.com/albums/s217/evilbiscuit/kaiseravatar-1.jpg" alt="The Evil Biscuit Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/53578/thread"><abbr data-timestamp="1270928145000" class="o-timestamp time" title="Apr 10, 2010 9:35:45 GMT -5">Apr 10, 2010 9:35:45 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/85" class="user-link user-85 group-11" itemprop="url" title="@evilbiscuit"><span itemprop="name">The Evil Biscuit</span></a></span> said:</div>Touch things, and be reminded that you shouldn't touch things by Williams.<div class="quote_clear"></div></div></div><br>"Don't bother," he added as Renard glanced around, "they're hidden."<br><br>"I touched nothing else," the detective promised with haste.<br><br>The Commissioner nodded heavily and looked down at the framed photograph. "Yeah, you wouldn't," he said.<br><br>"Are they your daughters?"<br><br>Williams hesitated, but then held up the picture. "Courtney--" (he pointed at the older girl in yellow) "--and Alicia." He pointed at the younger girl in pink. The grim glare had had the <i>courtoisie</i> not to persist. Williams regarded the picture temperately. "My babies," he added after a moment, again not quite out of necessity.<br><br>"How old are they now?" asked Renard.<br><br>"It's a pretty recent shot," the other man said, and left it at that. Renard smiled.<br><br>"Well, I think they are quite beautiful children, Commissioner."<br><br>Williams smirked wearily and looked up. "I appreciate that." He set the picture back down on the desk. It did not escape Renard that he angled it a bit more openly than it had been before, thereby not prohibiting the detective from seeing the girls. "They both take after Monica, course. Lucky for them. Wouldn't've minded having a son who looked like me, but no little girl deserves a mug like this."<br><br>Renard laughed a bit, noncommittally, not wishing to offensively agree with the self-deprecating comment but also aware that a reply of "<i>En fait</i>, Commissioner, I find you quite handsome" would not be much of a step up.<br><br>The other man looked at his watch. "And, Rouletabille," he went on, "I'm hoping not to get home so late I can't read them a bedtime story.

"I'm very grateful for your service, Rouletabille. We've already contacted the curator at his residence. We'll deliver the painting to the gallery tomorrow and arrange for your reward. They'll invite you over for a photo shoot, probably. You'll get interviewed, be in the papers. The whole works."<br><br>"Ah!" Renard responded brightly. He could not think of very much else to say. It seemed so easy from here on out. "<i>Fantastique!</i>" He started to get up. "So -- so is that it, then, Commissioner? Am I free to go for now?"<br><br>Williams raised a hand, palm downturned.<br><br>"Slow up there, sir," he said. "I didn't tell you to make this quick just so I could talk at you for a minute and then send you on your way. You need to give me some answers." He pulled his chair in and leaned forward, counting off fingers. "Such as. Where'd you find it? How'd you know where to look? Who stole it? Where are they now? And how in the hell did they get away with the thing in the first place?"<br><br>Renard paused.<br><br>"Oh! Well..." he started. His voice gave out. He took a breath and pondered.<br><br>The other man, despite his admonishment, was now himself standing up out of his seat. His profile was quite imposing under the florescent light overhead. "Come on, Rouletabille," he said in a low voice. "It was a Power, wasn't it? More than one? How many? Tell me. I need <i>details</i>. We're gonna turn this city inside-out. We need to send their kind a message: <i>They can't fuck with us like that.</i>" He strode around the desk and patted Micmac on the head again. His expression however was not as relaxed as before. "If one of 'em screws me over, I'm gonna take down three of 'em. If three of 'em screw me over, I'm gonna take down twenty of 'em. It's the <i>only way</i>, Rouletabille. You can't make a single Power pay for his crimes. All you can do is discipline the group. Make any infraction a betrayal against their whole kind.

I don’t know. I don’t care, whatever’s there. Yes, just microwave it. Bring it to my office please. Thank you.” He set the telephone back down and gave Renard a weary look. “Coming right up,” he said.<br><br>“Thank you very much,” said the detective.<br><br>“Now. Let’s hear the story, all right? How’d you find the painting?”<br><br>Renard had taken the duration of the telephone call to consider his <i>facultes</i>. His first instinct had been not to tell the Commissioner about Channery Keigler for fear of inciting the Giarrettiera organization against himself. No, perhaps that had not been so. Perhaps his very first thought had been that he didn’t wish to tell Williams about <i>mademoiselle</i> Keigler because Renard had discovered after all that he was fond of the young woman and wished her no harm. Self-evidently if this had been Renard’s first thought he would have dismissed it as sentimental and sought a more rational argument. Well he had one, in the form of the Giarrettieras. Good: he would not tell the Commissioner about Channery Keigler. <br><br>Yet ought he to tell Williams that a Power was responsible at all? Renard looked into the slightly <i>parchemine</i> face of the man sitting across from him. The Commissioner was only waiting for him to say the word in order to begin a citywide… what was it called… “crackledown” upon the Power community.

Here was a trickier question. “Well. You see, Commissioner, when I met you earlier today at the scene of the crime I took careful note of the exact dimensions of <i>Le roi Midas</i> judging from the patterns of dust around the space where it had hung. Then, not long after my second conversation with you upon the steps of the Gallery, I was surpassed on the road by an automobile containing a black <i>paquet</i> which I, with my eyes to match those of any bird of prey, appraised as equal to the length and width of the painting. I subtly tailed the automobile to the docks, where its occupant hauled the black leather parcel into a garage.” He paused for a moment against his will, sure that Williams would have called his excrement comparable to bovine fecal matter by now, but was uninterrupted. “Lacking any firearms with which to apprehend the criminal, I was forced to follow using only stealth, and by the time I reached the Boullogne, its porter had vanished.”<br><br>“But what did the man look like?” the Commissioner half-shouted.<br><br>Renard pursed his lips in thought. It had not occurred to him to invert Mlle. Keigler’s gender for this exercise. Yet that was a strikingly good idea. “He was wearing a baseball cap and a large backpack,” he said, “and so I was unable to get a proper glimpse of him. I only really saw him from behind and at a distance, you understand.”<br><br>“Then what did the <i>car</i> look like,” Williams groaned.<br><br>“Ah! It was a bright green… A bright green…” Renard’s knowledge of automobile brands failed him. He fell back on the only surefire answer. “A bright green ‘Vette.”<br><br>“A <i>what?</i> Oh, a Corvette.” Commissioner Williams rustled papers around on his desk to make space for his notebook, in which he was jotting down <i>minuties</i>. Renard felt quite satisfied that he had thrown the other man with his stylish abbreviated slang. “License number?”<br><br>Renard fetched his own much smaller notebook and pretended to consult a blank page while in fact sampling random letters and digits from the scrambled papers before him on the desk. “The plate was smeared in mud,” he explained, “and its inscription therefore difficult to decipher… But I believe the combination was something along the lines of, ah… GA 413TT.”<br><br>Williams took note. “So was this person a—? Oh, hello, Mrs. Eschholz.” For a woman roughly Renard’s age had arrived with a paper cup of steaming liquid. Micmac was considerate enough to give her a more <i>sourd</i> greeting than he had given to Commissioner Williams, with the result that the tea did not splatter all over the man’s office.<br><br>“Why aren’t you cute!” she exclaimed as the beast nuzzled her hand. “Here you are, Commissioner. Or is this yours?” She offered the cup to Renard.<br><br>“Yes, thank you very much,” he said.<br><br>“Is <i>he</i> yours?”<br><br>“Yes.”<br><br>“What’s his name?”<br><br>“It is ‘Micmac’.”<br><br>“<i>Micmac.</i>” Mrs. Eschholz beamed. “That’s adorable. <i>He’s</i> adorable. Anything else, Mr. Williams?”<br><br>“That’s fine, thank you,” said the Commissioner. Mrs. Eschholz saw her way out, though not before patting the dog again and murmuring goodbye to him. Williams settled back in his chair and returned his harsh gaze to Renard. “There you go, Rouletabille,” he added. “Don’t complain that it’s not as good as the Chinese stuff or whatever you’re used to. This isn’t a tea garden I’m running here.”<br><div class="quote" author="@ch00beh" timestamp="1281584992" source="/post/57645/thread"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-8" title="ch00beh" style="border-color: #666699;"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v487/Andurin/e109900a-d9c0-455e-9a18-7b21ddc48211_zps3cc7bef1.jpg" alt="ch00beh Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/57645/thread"><abbr class="o-timestamp time" title="Aug 11, 2010 17:49:52 GMT -5" data-timestamp="1281584992000">Aug 11, 2010 17:49:52 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/8" class="user-link user-8 group-2" itemprop="url" title="@ch00beh" style="color: #666699;"><span itemprop="name">ch00beh</span></a></span> said:</div>Scratch Micmac in thought.<div class="quote_clear"></div></div></div><div class="quote" author="@sapphirevaporeon" source="/post/57666/thread" timestamp="1281632937"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-38" title="SV" style="border-color: #008080;"><img src="http://s28638.storage.proboards.com/3328638/a/AL_EcLgYRzVRvo8FyA2k.png" alt="SV Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/57666/thread"><abbr data-timestamp="1281632937000" class="o-timestamp time" title="Aug 12, 2010 7:08:57 GMT -5">Aug 12, 2010 7:08:57 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/38" class="user-link user-38 group-16" itemprop="url" title="@sapphirevaporeon" style="color: #008080;"><span itemprop="name">SV</span></a></span> said:</div>Think to yourself about how adorable the name Micmac is.<div class="quote_clear"></div></div></div><br>Renard nodded as he sipped the tea.

He pulled some of the papers toward himself to clear a space for the cup, but then, with another look at Renard, apparently thought better of it. “Just… Just set it down on the shelf there,” he said, indicating a shelf slightly behind the detective and stocked with waterproof plastic binders. “And don’t make any big movements with your arms.” Renard interlaced his fingers on his lap. The Commissioner looked at his notebook. “Where were we? Right. Was this individual a Power? Could you tell when you saw him?”<br><br>“I saw nothing to prove that conclusively,” Renard responded, “and in fact I have reason to suspect he may not have needed to be one at all…”<br><br>“What?” Williams’ fists clenched. It was possible he hadn’t noticed. “Of course he was! How else could he have – Are you kidding me, Rouletabille? He <i>had</i> to have been a Power. Spare me your crackpot theories and—”<br><br>“I have reason to suspect he was not one,” Renard lied coolly. He reached out for the paper cup to take another sip and then fixed Williams with <i>un regard sang-froid</i>. “And may I say, Commissioner, I would hardly count it as advisable to declare war upon the Power community over something so trivial as a stolen painting. Your perception of ‘fairness’ is unlikely to be shared by those Powers who are consigned to suffering unduly for crimes they did not commit.

So how’s this, Frenchman. I won’t tell you how to blow bubbles and be useless. And you will not tell me how to keep Winstone City safe.

Come along, Micmac.” And he took Micmac’s leash in hand. He might have made it to the door if the Commissioner’s meaty fist had not seized Renard’s forearm.<br><br>“Explain why you don’t think he was a Power,” Williams demanded over Micmac’s growls.<br><br>Renard glared at him. “Ah, but what good is my explanation, if I am such a useless creature?”<br><br>For an instant Williams’ eyes grew more hateful than ever but then he relaxed and let go of Renard’s arm.

You've had a grueling day/night.<div class="quote_clear"></div></div></div><br>“Sir, it has been <i>grueling</i>,” Renard pronounced, standing up as well.<br><br>Micmac, who had curled up on the floor, sprang into action again and eagerly offered his leash to Renard, who took hold of it once he’d slipped his coat back on. “Will I be transported home?” he inquired.<br><br>“Arranged that when you came in,” said the Commissioner. “Landsvale’ll give you a ride home. He lives downtown too, and there’s enough room in the back for the big guy.”<br><br>“Oh magnificent,” said Renard. “And… <i>Le roi Midas?</i>” he asked, watching Williams hoist it up out of the chair.<br><br>“It’ll stay in our vault overnight. Which is manned by surveillance personnel twenty-four-seven. So no one’s gonna be waltzing in dressed as a potted plant, I promise you.” With the painting under one sturdy arm, Williams opened the door. Renard tugged Micmac up and out of the office, dropping the emptied paper cup into a dustbin on the way out. Williams closed and locked the door, then tried the doorknob a few times. Then he straightened up and the two men stood face-to-face. After a moment, he offered his hand and added, “You did well, Rouletabille, I mean it.”<br><br>Renard shook it. “Thank you very much.”<br><br>“No. Thank you,” Williams muttered. “Now get out of here, all right? Go rest up. You want to look your best tomorrow. Like I said – photos.”<br><br>“<i>Merveilleux</i>,” said Renard. “And all speed to you in your return home tonight, sir. I hope you arrive in time to see your daughters off to sleep.”<br><br>“I appreciate that, Rouletabille.”<br><br>Excitedly: “In fact I still remember several of the stories my father used to tell me – quite funny and imaginative tales – perhaps you might be interested to hear them – loosely translated, of course. I am reminded of the one about the baker’s wife who—”<br><br>“<i>Thanks</i>,” Williams interrupted. “Another time, maybe.”<br><br>But he was actually grinning.<br><br>“See you tomorrow, Rouletabille. Bright and early.”<br><br>“Bright and early, Commissioner,” Renard affirmed.<br><br>The other man stooped briefly to give Micmac one more stern scratching about the neck, then, raising his free hand flattened in a not-quite-salute, turned and walked down the brightly lit hall further into the building. Renard caught one more glimpse of King Midas, awestruck on the riverbank, before the Commissioner and the Boullogne passed through another door and vanished.<br><br>Inspector Denham Landsvale was waiting for him in the lobby.<br><br>“<i>Heard</i> you brought a dog,” he said by way of greeting. He knelt down. “Good boy.” For Micmac visited upon him the hearty hello that was the dog’s <i>habitude</i>.<br><br>“Hello again, Inspector.”<br><br>“Yeah,” said Landsvale, standing up again to regard the detective with his pale, very tired eyes. “Ready to head?”<br><br>They proceeded out the glass doors into the parking lot, where Landsvale made a line for a large peacock-blue automobile Renard believed was termed a “minivan”. “I have been given to understand you live relatively close to me.”<br><br>“Well…” Landsvale said, opening one of the back doors, “Kind of. Not really. Think Williams sort of misunderstood me.” He folded down both of the middle row seats, a neat trick Renard hadn’t seen before. “Didn’t feel like arguing though.”<br><br>“Oh no,” said Renard, “am I putting your out of your way? Please, sir, don’t require yourself to—”<br><br>“Forget it,” he replied. He beckoned Micmac up, and the dog bounded heavily into the automobile. “Don’t mind driving at all.” He slid the back door shut and pointed at the front passenger door, which Renard opened.<br><br>“Thank you very much, Inspector.”<br><br>“It’s nothing,” said Landsvale as they got in. He started the automobile. “Seems like you deserve it anyway,” he added as they pulled out of the lot.<br><br>“Ah, well, perhaps,” said Renard.<br><br>“Lot of money coming your way, I guess?”<br><br>“A bit,” he answered, in the manner of one who had almost forgotten.<br><div class="quote" author="@ch00beh" timestamp="1281509935" source="/post/57599/thread"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-8" title="ch00beh" style="border-color: #666699;"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v487/Andurin/e109900a-d9c0-455e-9a18-7b21ddc48211_zps3cc7bef1.jpg" alt="ch00beh Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/57599/thread"><abbr title="Aug 10, 2010 20:58:55 GMT -5" class="o-timestamp time" data-timestamp="1281509935000">Aug 10, 2010 20:58:55 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/8" class="user-link user-8 group-2" itemprop="url" title="@ch00beh" style="color: #666699;"><span itemprop="name">ch00beh</span></a></span> said:</div> 3.

He would visit her tomorrow evening at the Passione Rossa and deliver the cash.

Nominally Mlle. Keigler’s disbursement had been for the purpose of administering repairs to his crippled automobile but Renard could conceive of more creative applications for it than that. Indeed, perhaps it was time to let the old buggy go. He couldn’t help but feel that the <i>mademoiselle</i> had the right idea with her cheap, light bicycle. Why not sell the small black automobile for salvage and take home even more money? A good bicycle would be a far tinier investment. Renard envisioned himself patrolling the streets of Ecruteak on two wheels, cutting an impressive figure as he listened for whispers of wrongdoing.<br><br>“’D you find the thing anyway?”<br><br>“In a storage facility on the docks,” Renard replied quickly. The Inspector nodded.<br><br>And then he could purchase a replacement camera. Perhaps one of the modern kinds that popped the photograph right out upon its inception. Technology could be a boon at times despite its best efforts. And there would be food and supplies for Micmac (who was currently busy emitting saliva all over an unconcerned Landsvale’s upholstery), and the phone bill would be satisfied, so that he could place a call to Mlle. Keigler and ensure that the dog’s needs would be met. And, of course, he would be able to ring up his dear aged mother…<br><br>“Some kind of hero, aren’t you,” Landsvale commented idly.<br><br>Renard thought about it, then smiled. “I suppose, technically, yes,” he said to the Inspector, “provided there is anyone in the world with a definition of ‘hero’ so broad as to encompass me…”<br><div class="quote" author="@ch00beh" source="/post/57607/thread" timestamp="1281543576"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-8" title="ch00beh" style="border-color: #666699;"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v487/Andurin/e109900a-d9c0-455e-9a18-7b21ddc48211_zps3cc7bef1.jpg" alt="ch00beh Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/57607/thread"><abbr title="Aug 11, 2010 6:19:36 GMT -5" class="o-timestamp time" data-timestamp="1281543576000">Aug 11, 2010 6:19:36 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/8" class="user-link user-8 group-2" itemprop="url" title="@ch00beh" style="color: #666699;"><span itemprop="name">ch00beh</span></a></span> said:</div>Tweak mustache triumphantly.<div class="quote_clear"></div></div></div><div class="quote" timestamp="1281509788" source="/post/57598/thread" author="@admin"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-1" title="LeeTupper" style="border-color: #FFFFFF;"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v202/LeeTupper/New%20avatar_zpsuph1bjm6.png" alt="LeeTupper Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/57598/thread"><abbr data-timestamp="1281509788000" class="o-timestamp time" title="Aug 10, 2010 20:56:28 GMT -5">Aug 10, 2010 20:56:28 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/1" class="user-link user-1 group-1" itemprop="url" title="@admin" style="color: #FFFFFF;"><span itemprop="name">LeeTupper</span></a></span> said:</div>A happy ending!<div class="quote_clear"></div></div></div><br>A distant roar sounded overhead. He craned his neck to glance up past the reflections of the streetlamps into the night sky. An airplane flew over them, intermittently visible among the <i>dispersents</i> clouds. Micmac whined. Perhaps it was the plane carrying Channery Keigler to her residence abroad. Or should she by this time already be over the Pacific? It didn’t matter. She was on her way home and so was he, and the Inspector and the Commissioner too. The airplane passed out of sight. He relaxed his head against the seat. He propped his elbow up by the window and tweaked his moustache very slightly. With all of the rain, the temperature tonight would be cool. He would sleep easily.
