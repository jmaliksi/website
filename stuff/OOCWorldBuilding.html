        <div class="content"><div class="message">So remember this guy:<br><br><img style="max-width: 100%;" src="http://www.prism.gatech.edu/~jmaliksi3/portfolio/art/walker.jpg"><br><br>and how there was a city on his back? So anyway, I drew that guy as an RP location possibility in the future, but as a small part of a bigger world. We haven't really done any fresh world building because everything is so heavily reliant on canon and whatnot and everyone is all focused on their street level characters and blah blah blah so I figure we could use a little change sometime down the line.<br><br>Buuuuuuuut going with the unorthodox format, instead of separating things by time, or instead of merging everything into a clusterfuck, I was thinking we make things nice and simple and have separate topics for separate locations. Why you ask? Because that's how big the world I want to create is. And by create, I mean evolve out of writer contributions. I still need to create foundations and themes on the separate areas, the socioeconomic and political climates, the lore of the land, etc etc. Just foundations though. Everyone else can be responsible for the details. And, as everyone knows, it takes me a long time to make foundations because they are usually rock solid and lend to all kinds of crazy hijinks.<br><br>So what does everyone think of this? I'm in a rush, so this is probably the worst typed out thing ever.</div></div>

Not quite cute, but a place where danger is inapparent and the most terrifying appearing things can be harmless (or lethal), and the most innocuous things can be lethal (or harmless).<br><br>Something where reality teeters on the edges of madness, where the nonchalance of the denizens only enhances the bizarreness of their domicile.<br><br>Of course, if you want to limit it to a single area, I'll be happy to work on the district of Mindrapia.<br><br>Secondary Idea: Start off with only one continent known, and others only a rumored new world, like how Europe was in the 1500's. Sure, there's other things OUT THERE, but we don't know one tenth of it.<br><br>That way, we can focus and polish one area to perfection.<br><br>Blood, get your carcass in here.

And, as Lee can attest, <i> I likes me my bread and butter</i><br><br>Choobs, for FRP I actually have an entirely new area that I'm going to use in my own RP (Ghemt Station).  That'll be out by Pluto, but that's all I'll say for now (just in case I actually get enough interest and a large enough opening to run it).<br><br>In PRP I had Durant come from an unnamed town north of Lavender (granted Pyrite is his hometown, but that's never been used in PRP). <br><br>Shoot, when I was thirteen I created a whole <i>world</i> that I've been dieing to breath life back into. (I have cultures, languages, races, landmasses. Lee's heard me drone on about them all before.)<br><br>Choobs, depending on exactly what you want to do, I may become your best friend. </div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">dude, i am the best world builder. my buddy and i made an entire <i>galaxy</i> which we plan on putting into game form this summer. it was so in depth we accidentally stumbled upon 3 conspiracies we had no idea existed. i also made the rules for a theoretical particle that makes so much pseudoscience possible. and managed to explain why one of the most advanced civilizations fight like a spartan phalanx <font size="1">IN SPACE</font><br><br>but anyway, the mindrapia seems pretty interesting. my overall feel for this world was going to be sort of a Westert/new-frontiers type thing, or some grandiose RPG type feeling, because I'm a simpleton that thinks in terms of industry standards. Throw some steampunk in there, too, just for good measure.<br><br>anyway, if everyone just wants to come up with ideas and throw them in here, i'm sure blood and i can come up with a lore/mythos that can glue everything together. I already have ideas on how to reconcile steampunk with magic (steampunk technology is essentially using water based magic. also, since water is an important divining element, priests are steampunk. QED). <br><br>Also, this is not Earth, so feel free to go crazy with weird shit like coevolution of sapient species. I'm probably going to start up a new forum if i get enough backing (oh yeah, Lee, this is me asking permission or something. surprise!)<br><br>tl;dr - have at it with the ideas.</div></div>

        <h2 class="poster">Hamuu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">I must ponder. </div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Hamuu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">So here's what I thought up. When you mentioned a non spherical world my mind went into overdrive. I picture a world that has no "bottom" half, at least in the normal sense. I have an image on my computer I can link that kinda gives you an idea of what I am about to say and I will link it later. Basicaly underneath the world is a series of rocks (think like an asteroid belt, or kinda like the floating mountains in Avatar.) Some of them are miles apart and others in clusters. Some are massive and others are tiny. <br><br>The entire area is massive and it can take weeks travel from one side to the other. Near the very bottom of the world is where the largest and closest Rock formations are. Center is a mix of large and small clusters of various sizes and distances. And the furthest from the planet is the smaller and more spaced out "lonely" rocks. <br><br>The main thing about this area is that it's saturated with Magic. Every rock is has it's own individual up and down. This means that two adjacent rocks could be completely different. Also, until you touch a different rock you are compelled by the current rocks gravity. <br><br>There are two distinct groups of people down here. A tribe that has been living here for long enough that they can naturally use magic (preferring to use a nature based form) and a mining colony/corporation that has been working to extract ore and precious metals from the rocks. When the mining colony first started there was a lot of trouble with the native tribes. Eventually though, over generations, the mining colony found that their children were slowly beginning to develop a control over external magic. When this occurred the two groups entered into a non-aggression pact. Eventually the mining colony expanded and developed a few cities in the area. <br><br>Nowadays most of the people living within the mining colonies can control magic like the tribe. However they choose to combine magic and technology, unlike the nature based magic of the tribe. Also the Company and the Tribe have taken the non-aggression pact even farther and have begun trading. The tribe wish to teach the new generation of children from the mining colony both respect and limitation when it comes to using magic. Users who become magically addicted can become dangerous to everyone around them, the tribe believes instilling these lessons early in the Company before they get to the point the tribe is at will help them be more prepared. <br><br>The company and the tribe live separately but do have one neutral city where the two intermingle for trade and such. <br><br>The tribe prefers to build naturally and as such, their cities are located in naturally occurring clusters. When two rocks are linked via a bridge of some sort, the bridge gradually shifts gravity as it approaches the rock. This has lead to some very complex paths from rock to rock. <br><br>However the Company prefers to moves rocks into formations that suit their needs. Most of their cities are globe shape and most of the mining out posts are flat. Their city are like tiny planets that they build in tiers. The outer tier being mostly defensive. The next tier in being industry and trade, the next tier being entertainment and rec, and the tiers closest to the middle being homes.<br><br>So... what do you think? I do good? Or did I completely miss what I was suppose to do/come up with? </div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">so if this is a Discworld-esque place, that means at the edges, the large bodies of water just drain off the edge. Alternatively, they drain into holes or something. Anyway, so if they just drain, the water has to come from somewhere, right? Bringing back the idea of steampunk things, I'm imagining a large ball of endless water floating above a mountain range in the center of the world that runs off into just about every body of water. Maybe there are smaller aquaspheres elsewhere. Anyway monastery is built around it housing monk/priest/doods that have been around as long as anyone can remember, constantly praying that the water is infinite.<br><br>They are priests because water is a conduit for the divine, so they believe, or they actually do, talk to divine, or demonic, or just otherworldly beings regularly. I guess of greater power since they've got the fountain. <br><br>Also, their livelihood is based on water magic. Now, if water is made to boil just by willing it, you have a clean, if inefficient, way to create electricity. Tada, steampunk tech.<br><br>Someone else remix or rehash any and all of the above. I'm just throwing out ideas.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">long post is long<br><br><br><img style="max-width: 100%;" src="http://www.swagonline.net/files/images/2045.preview.jpg"><br><br>The Desert, the Isiyoshindika, and the Imikijini<br><br>On this world is a desert – a vast, arid stretch of barren land that, despite the planet’s seemingly inifinite sources of water, remains unquenchable. This is due to many geographical factors, most notably its proximity to the Kakana mountain range and subsequent isolation from the seasonal monsoons that supply the rainward side of the Kakanas, but also contributing are its position during perihelion and many millennia of climate drift. With mountains on two sides and no true access to rivers or bodies of fresh water, the desert is, in essence, completely locked out.<br><br>At first glance, the desert would seem uninhabitable (no true attempts at colonization have ever succeeded, due either to inhospitable seasonal weather conditions or hostile natives) however, the desert is in fact populated by a race of tribal wanderers known as the Imikijini (Sun People). The tribal name for the desert is the Isayoshindika, a word meaning ‘Unconquerable’. Speaking an ancient language and holding fast to arcane traditional cultures, the Imikijini have inhabited the desert since before written history. <br><br>Population migration is nonexistent – while there are large numbers of Imikijini merchants, hunters, and vendors interspersed throughout the world, there are no other permanent communities of Imikijini anywhere else on the planet. <br><br>Imikijini biology is not far removed from other human anatomy – environmental adaptation has simply fostered small physiological evolutions. A healthy Imikijini adult can live up to two weeks without water, and nearly two months without food. The skin and mucous membranes are nearly double the thickness of standard humans, and cells retain and store moisture nearly ten times more efficiently. Glottal tissue in the throat has evolved into a pair of vented muscles that swing together during inhalation, acting as both filter and heatsink for the heated, particle-rich air that circulates across the Isayoshindika. This physiological evolution also lends itself to the unique vocalizations of Imikijini songs – the vented flaps produce a variety of whistles and warbles that accompany vocal overtones, resulting in a diverse, multifaceted vocal sound that is unique only to this race.<br><br>Though their traditions and cultures are somewhat dated, the Imikijini have embraced modernization to a degree. While the practice of <i>ha duk la’ak</i>, ‘water kiting’ is still practiced in many clans, it is not uncommon to see an array of vaporators erected along the outskirts of a village to keep a steady supply. Their biology allows them to survive the harsh climates, but generally a rebreather is worn with the traditional wraps in inclement weather. Though travel is largely by foot or by beast, there are plenty of hunting skiffs and cruisers to be found skimming over the arid dunes. By far the greatest modern technology employed by these desert dwellers is the powder rifle. In the three hundred years since the first matchlocks were introduced to the Imikijini, their skill and application of projectile weapons has grown into the very fabric of their culture. Imikijini marksmen are the best in the world – using handmade rifles, each one unique to its owner, the tribal shooters hold nearly every distance record written. Marksmen are chosen at a young age, and many are learning to shoot rifles before age five. The rifles of the Imikijini are expertly crafted works of art, painted and decorated and engraved with meticulous craftsmanship; to own one and not be a clan member is a rare and exorbitantly expensive privilege.<br><br>Imikijini magic is, naturally, the magic of the sands. While most everyone has the capacity for manipulating sand, culturally only certain tribesmen are raised to cultivate this talent. These men are shamans, typically, or Keepers – something to be explained later. Several theories exist that lay the Isayoshindika’s refusal of water and rain squarely at the feet of these tribesmen and their magic.<br><br></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">how technologically advanced is everyone thinking this place will be at maximum? Logically, any place that has magic will use that instead of science to do things, but say there is a people who cannot/refuse magic and just rely on technology. what kind of crazy hijinks will they be doing? flying cars or industrial revolution or birth of gunpowder?<br><br>it sounds like the Imaoeunacoiahokcki are at flying cars due to trade?<br><br>PS. I'd say only the crazy Iaeouasicjknki have cars because sand + complex mechanical parts = lulz.<br><br>PPS. I want a Iqjsrkicarkikiki.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">lol. You can pronounce it Eh-Ma-Kesh-Ni.<br><br>And I threw tech in there just because. You'll see I made up a whole buttload of stuff.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Ohhhh. Well, let's say that swords are common and guns are... newer. Not like automatics and things, but flintlocks and percussive hammers, ball shot, powder. <br><br>The Imikijini have taken it a step further with rifling. More distance, more accuracy.  </div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">ch00beh</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">so basically gunpowder is around, but it's expensive to do, and people would rather magic if they can.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">The Evil Biscuit</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Yes.<br><br>Ooh, we could say that gunpowder's taboo - that mixing natural elements like that is unnatural and wrong. So people are afraid to use it because it sort of flies in the face of natural magic. You'll find it used by criminals and vagrants and other lowlifes who can't use magic very well.<br><br>Not that the Imikijini are criminals and vagrants, mind you. They just believe that gunpowder is sacred.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">ch00beh</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">ooooh i like that idea. chemistry is bad!<br><br>and magic is ok because ____________<br><br>EDIT: Because it's taught and controlled by the Order/Church/Government/Overseer and it's very well studied and documented whereas chemistry is seen as a potentially hazardous new thang (see stem cells and nukes). Throw in some way to physically control magic, possibly? Like some kind of ____________ that acts as a catalyst to commune with spirits/nature/atoms. <br><br>Atomic magic. Hm.<br><br>Anyway, since the Imiaoseuackrceni have honed the idea of guns to perfection, that means the world is probably on the cusp of a tech spread and boom and paradigm shift or something. idk.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">The Evil Biscuit</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Possibly. I would be more inclined to say that because the Imikijini have guns (and not necessarily any other tech) that they're viewed as hostile savages; maybe even demon worshippers. So perhaps full-scale war is brewing over those who embrace magic and shun chemistry and the Imikijini who make use of both. <br><br>Instead of tech exploding onto the scene, maybe it's medicine. The Imikijini could be building elaborate chemistry sets using homespun glass to create practical ingredients for any application. Their culture could be one of using the planet's resources for better living rather than just living on it and using magic to manipulate it. <br><br>EDIT: I like atomic magic. Let's do that. </div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">ch00beh</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">i'm a little iffy on the "savages are secretly really nice." Keep them as survivalist nomads or w/e. Or at least just straight up survivalists. Only makes sense in a desert to always look out for yourself first and foremost. Coming together in cities in order to have access to gun making and glass blowing facilities is part of the whole "looking out for themselves" thing. Dunno who would be permanent members of the cities. Maybe slaves? Robots? I don't see a caste system working for them.<br><br>But despite their survivalist tendencies, I do see them as knowing how to live off the land as efficiently and cleanly as possible.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">The Evil Biscuit</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">I feel ya. When I said homespun glass, I meant 'made with magic'. They wouldn't go into cities for access to anything, really, unless they just needed to barter for something like parts or perishables. I see their society as extremely self-contained; they don't see the outside world as something they need or depend on. If they needed parts for gunmaking, they would trade for it, certainly, but these weapons are for the most part EXTREMELY sacred. All the pieces would generally be hand-made. The iron ore would be mined, bought, or bartered, as would the raw wood, if needed, but the crafting of barrels and triggers and stocks would be performed by the tribe. <br><br>As for a caste system in cities- well, I could see them as sort of lower, or maybe not even included. They live in the desert, they wear all those ratty clothes, they use guns and herbs and other chemistry-related objects. Why wouldn't someone be wary of them?</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Hamuu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">When I think of the Sand Shaman guys, I think of a mix of Gara from Naruto and earth benders from Avatar, though I thinking that the "sand bending" would be more like water bending from the show since it many fine particles and would flow better. <br><br>I also see a really neat scene in my head with a war where some group of people is fighting a bunch of the Imakkjajinky people and just as they are about to make a massive push the Sand Shamans get together, and combine their efforts to create a massive sandstorm which they use as cover to retreat. Would be AWESOME.<br><br>I also like where choobs is going with the top of the world. If the top world is more steam punk based since theirs seems a more elemental based magic, and the world I've created (the underneath world) is more of a purity of magic (though the tribe chooses to focus their magic in a druid way) the company for instance focuses their magic into technology. I see that as meaning the underside world would have sleeker, cleaner technology, while the topside world would be the grittier, steam-punk stuff.<br><br>Also, it would be cool if their were some fringe cities. That were on the edge of the world bridging the cultural and directional differences of the bottom and top worlds. <br><br>And playing off of Choobs idea. I like the constant floating ball of water, but I think we could go farther with it. I say, the water is constantly draining from the "heavens" like there is a cloud bank that this long waterfall like stream is coming from. I think it should only be a floating ball of water because there are a large number of these monks constantly exerting force on it and that keeps it collected up in the air and they let it out in controlled amounts because if they didn't there's enough water there to cause a large inland flood if it all came down at once. <br><br>I also think that as the water drains down off the edge of the world it falls into the abyss and that it eventually falls back to the top does that make sense? I see it as all water falling off the world collects in some other plane before being returned to the top where it flows into the sphere of floating water. <br><br>Ok that's all my crazy stuff for now. </div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">See, all this Immokakajin and Ikamikitikichakazaka and Imjauauajiaii stuff that you guys keep saying fits perfectly with the way I see these guys as being treated by the rest of the world. Strange, unknown, ancient, and bizarre. </div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">ch00beh</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">ya i was thinking of having the water flow back into the ball. Heavenly waterfall sounds legit.<br><br>I'm trying to figure out where the Walkers would roam. I've also toyed with just making them large land tortoises because that's a safer place to make a city. Reason for being up there is that it keeps the people safe from predators that aren't crazy enough to attack the biggest kid around or who can't climb up the creature's legs. And I'm trying to figure out how they make a symbiotic relationship, or at least how to have a sustainable place up there. I guess the people could always just have resource gathering expeditions.<br><br>So my brain is now pointing to the Walkers (either tortoise or taller) to roam a dangerous as fuck rainforest. Or maybe they're attracted to naturally occurring aquaspheres.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">oppps accidentally posted this in crystal part 2 lol<br><br>So reading what you guys are saying about the top world has given me a few ideas for the underworld. Also, what do you think about the name The Nexus for the underworld territory? I like it, but it’s kinda overdone… Think of something better please <img src="//images.proboards.com/f/smiley/tongue.png" alt=":P" class="smile"><br><br>Anyways, I like the idea that, as you get closer to the “bottom” of the world (that magical spot where the water suddenly shifts from under to over the world) magic becomes more concentrated. That would explain why top side fewer people learn magic and why there are crystals that are usually required. While bottom side the magic is more concentrated, hence why the tribe and the company use it about more widespread and it’s more common, (I see top side world 1 out of 30 are magically oriented while underside it’s more 1 in 5.) Also since they are closer to the “center”? they are born with the ability to manipulate the natural magic current. I also think that the tribes druid like people could be called Ecomancers while the companys magic users could be called Technomancers since they are full on magic and tech combine. <br><br>Also I like the idea that bottomsiders aren’t as strong topside because there’s less natural magic in the air (it’s concentrated in the naturally occurring crystal/whatever) so when bottomside mancers go top side they have to either suffice with less power or find and harvest some of this naturally occurring stuff.<br><br>What do we think?<br></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Ok I will have to do two posts. (stupid photobucket is pissing me off so I'm just going to do attachments. <br><br>First questions. The company is sorta high tech but only in specific areas. They still mine the "hard way" they do use conveyor belts to move ore around but those aren't massively advanced but do require at least one to two Technomancers to operate. They use hot air balloons to travel around. When they find a new chunk to mine they attach ropes to it that connect it to the balloon. This is when they use their most advanced bit of technology. They have a device that converts magic into propulsion. It can usually be operated by one technomancer but some chunks require a lot of these things to move so sometimes they have a whole team of technomancers powering several of these things. They also have a sort of mechanized trolley but it's for large loads of ore and if you were to use it as a car you'd be passed by people walking. (it's slow and massive)<br><br>They are however on the edge of a high-tech break through. They have experimented with putting these magic propulsion devices on frames with wheels for speed but they lose almost all ability to turn. They are also trying to develop some type of airship but there are lots of kinks to be worked out. <br><br>Their most commonly used device is called a Focus. It's a small rod with lots of wires sticking out of the end. They channel their technomancer abilities through this and it can be used as a multipurpose device. You could channel your magic into a whip, a sword, a dagger, and ax. You could do a short burst and use it like a tazer, or a big burst and use it like a cannon. It's mainly used in mining but a few people do purchase them for protection. <br><br>They are fairly self sufficient but because there isn't much area for them to grow crops or raise livestock they trade with the tribe for produce and the topsiders for meat (mostly in living livestock so it remains fresh until they get it to one of their slaughter farms. <br><br>As for the nature vs tech fight that was in the past and as of right now they are at a pretty nice mutual peace. Their still a long ways off from eventually assimilating each other though. <br><br>Also I like the term "the Endless" for the area beneath the world.<br><br>Ok, so the image I linked is kinda an idea I had for how this place looks. (based so far) The mountain range is in the center and, though I didn't draw it that way, i can totally see it extending longer. The water sphere and the clouds are there. I see it as the dense jungle growing really close to the interior which then fades into forests and then into the big desert. I know biscuit had some landmarks and such so those would need to be incorporated. I also don't picture it as perfectly round or oval, that's just how it came out cause I suck at drawing. <br><br><div class="post_attachments"><b>Attachments:</b><br><br><blockquote><a href="/attachment/download/6"><img src="http://s28638.storage.proboards.com/3328638/t/jRM3THyHYxZSuBfCjWdJ.jpg" alt="World Building.jpg"></a><br><br></blockquote></div></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Alright, the top image is the side view of Vast in relation to its two suns. One sun is slightly higher while the other is pretty even, I’ll explain why I did this when I get to the seasons. I have a moon, which I think more than one moon is kinda ugh, but if you guys think we need more go for it.<br><br>I also think that the disc would should rotate, I think 36 hour days sound neat, so 36 hours for the world to make one complete turn. <br><br>Ok the seasons are on the second page. I did a top view this time. So I have a seven season year with six season’s total. The left side is the warmer seasons because the orbit is closer to this sun while the right side is the bigger orbit so it’s cooler. So let’s start in the middle. This is the worst kind of summer ever. A sun on either side means that there really is no night. It’s constant harsh sunlight. The only relief is in the wooded and jungle areas topside and bottom side has it a little better off because they are only getting direct sunlight from one sun. But it’s still supper hot. <br><br>Then the next season is just as hot because they are closer to the sun (but it’s only one son so now they get a night again. The way I have it set up is that the mountain (the big mutha with the water ball is large enough to cast a massive shadow over whatever is behind it. So as the disc rotates the mountain creates the night behind it. The moon creates random patches of darkness based on its location and the position of the sun at the time. During the warmer months the night is decided bottom side by the disc world itself, casting a little over half in darkness with a smaller portion getting daylight. So topside has shorter nights and bottomside has longer nights during the warm months. <br><br>Next is a spring like season, this is a heavy rain like season following 5ish months of intense heat. It’s a nice reprieve before they cross in-between the suns again.<br><br>Which is the next season which is the return of the summer of death and no night time again. <br><br>It then loops toward the other sun. <br><br>Which brings us to a fall like season. Because this sun is lower, the bottom side really doesn’t get a definite night through the next three seasons. Instead, the portions of the bottomside that are farthest from the sun get a kinda twilight like dusk. <br><br>Next is a winter like season. It’s also good to add, when Vast is orbiting this sun, that the top side has longer nights and like I already said the bottom side gets a twilight.<br><br>Then we go into another spring like season.<br><br>Which turns into summer of death. Repeat the whole process.<br><br>I think the year should begin and end in the middle of the death summer. I can see the monks having some type of dial on one of the mountains that twice a year lines up with both suns. The first time means end of year and beginning of the next, while the second time means that they are finally going to start heading towards the cooler season. I see the second time the dial lines up as being a festival like day since it marks the end of the horrible summer months. (minus the spring reprieve month.) <br><br>What ya think?<br><br><br><div class="post_attachments"><b>Attachments:</b><br><br><blockquote><a href="/attachment/download/7"><img src="http://s28638.storage.proboards.com/3328638/t/FCzwyLHX_WzDxBlpcyYC.jpg" alt="Season of World Building.jpg"></a><br><br></blockquote></div></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">I think that there should be something in the middle region. This is only a rough draft, as I'm pressed for time. Let me know what you think. <br><br><br>Golaudrin<br><br>A race of small insect-like creatures that lives in the mists between the the two lands. They are ruled by the Tolt, a subspecies that grows into a much larger size and is able to carry things to and from either land. Regular Golaudrin are no smarter than average insects and they die if they stray too close to either land. Due to the dangers of the middle region, the Golaudrin are often carried away from it within the safety of the Tolt when the time comes to breed. In return, the swarms of Golaudrin protect the Tolt by ramming into any incoming rocks. </div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">ch00beh</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">i agree that something should be in the middle region. Lee's mindf*ck horror thing might work here too.<br><br>I assume those insect dudes carry back or destroy any foreign object that tries to cross in either direction?<br><br>Also, I want to clarify that when I said there was mist in the middle, I didn't mean that it completely obscures the view. People on the water side can see dim fires of the other land mass. <br><br>Thinking of calling water side "Here" and the other side "Far."<br><br>on another note, I keep thinking about magic and how it's governed. There are multiple ways to channel the crystals in my mind:<br><ul><br><li>Glyphs/symbols - think FMA alchemy. You draw something out of basic command shapes that cause a crystal's magic energies to flow in a certain way, doing what you want. The most basic way to perform magic; pretty much everyone knows the basics. Drawing is done with pencil type dealios made from the crystal.<br></li><li>Singing - A little more flexible in that you're not bound to a surface. Basically you harmonize with the crystal using your voice to direct the magical energies. Unless you're really good with your voice, though, your abilities are probably limited to simple spells.<br></li><li>Willpower - Through sheer force of mind alone you can direct a crystal's magical energies. Lower levels of this will use incantations and/or movements to keep the mind focused. Experienced mages can just think really hard. Like really really really experienced.<br></li><li>Movement - A mage can just physically move the crystal in certain patterns to perform spells.<br></li><li>Body - requires you to ingest crystals regularly. Since the magic is now literally flowing through your veins, you can do more complex Movement commanded spells. Also, you can use your actual blood to perform magic, because blood magic is scary awesome.<br></li></ul></div></div>

Don't say 'I don't like this idea, but 129374793 people do, so I will include it.'<br><br>I did that and ended up having a war of mages on my homebrew world, resulting in 1/3 of a landmass the size of North America being turned to vapor.<br><br>Lore of the Land is a good route to go, its safe in the aspect of you can do anything with it. Heck, do something like the Source Wall from DC, where it is protecting something beyond our understanding. Anything is neat really.<br><br>Now, on to the map. It seems you have one main landmass, with a few outlying sections, like this was a rag tag map pulled together from reading/seeing things in the world. Its great for a player base because it can create a lot of mystery about the great beyond. What really lies beyond the sea to the west? What creatures hide there? It can allow for a lot of plots and interesting gaming ideas.<br><br>The thing that really pulls my eye the 'Mount Olympus' like section in the center. Is that a drawing mistake? Or was that aimed to be a super massive mountain of win? Either way, its a good idea none the less.<br><br>I can start spouting out a lot of geek questions because I remember having to build my world on my own, and stumbling a lot though the creation.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Yeah grey stuff is water. anything beyond in the parchment texture is SPACE.<br><br>Mount Olympus was intentional. I guess you skimmed over it, but at the very top of Mt Olympus is a great waterfall from the sky, which is contained in a giant sphere by monks. It's the source of all major bodies of water. There's a smaller peak to the south, but it does not have an aquasphere on top, and it's just being an asshole and blocking water from entering the desert.<br><br>Also, I know it's my world, but I want to lay out the geography and people and stuff by letting everyone fill stuff in. I'm very whimsical like that.<br><br>Kind of considering splitting that giant landmass into two separate continents, but it's kind of hard what with that bigass mountain.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">yeah there are cities and villages and such around. swords and arrows are the norm. gunpowder is forbidden. i'd say transportation... magic steam driven trains possibly. electricity? i'm on the fence for that. like i said, steampunk tech could be brought in, or that could be kept to the high mountains with the monks.<br><br>Okay! Stream of conscious time!<br><br>there are a small handful of the giant creatures, but each one has a city/village atop. each group of people is different due to living in relative isolation, but they share common practices that more relate to the practicalities of living on the back of a giant living creature. haven't really come up with many besides deep respect for the animal and not using shelves. small ecosystems do grow on the turtle's backs, but fauna mostly consists of birds. because these ecosystems are small, there won't be a huge number of people living there; just whatever the bare minimum for a sustainable population is. due to lack of farm space, they don't live exclusively off what's on the turtle-back and hunter-gatherer groups regularly make trips to the surface to get resources. <br><br>water is siphoned whenever the turtle comes across a natural aquasphere. I'm thinking that on that seasonal migration, when it comes time to lay eggs (external fertilization, just to give the guys living there a break) they drop the eggs in the water run off of sufficiently large aquaspheres. These spheres tend to grow in the desert. The turtles return to the rainforest so that they can eat. Hm. They might also look for mates and travel in a pair until breeding time. Gives reason for two turtle villages to work together.<br><br>thought of another cultural practice they share with each other: due to low resources and space, they practice lots of birth control, probably a one child per couple thang. once enough children reach a certain age, they are sent as a small group to brave the rainforest/desert to find another turtle village. some of them either assimilate into the other surface cities, some die, etc.<br><br>magic practice on the turtles is limited since they don't have access to prestigious higher education. since they travel mainly between the rainforest and desert, both very isolated places, their contact with "normal" civilization is minimal. Possibly they have an agreement with the Imaoeunaoiasckcitji. <br><br>that's all i can think of for now. i'll make a formal write up eventually i guess. i'll eventually make up a name for the turtles, too. something like Auts or something equally retarded.<br><br>back to cities on the overcontinent: i'm thinking there will even be kingdoms with borders and such. Mostly they'd keep to the plains in the northern and western region. Smaller villages in the mountains and northern forests, too. this allows for some good ol' warring kingdoms and stupid peasants and evil tyrants.<br><br>if bulbs wants to move his people to the asteroid belt, then i was thinking the underside is populated with monsters and crazy shit. that little bit of land on the eastern edge occasionally gets attacked by monsters that wander up. so whoever lives by that edge is crazy prepared for warfare.<br><br><br><br>PS. I just realized that the turtle people stop by magic crystal outcroppings regularly due to the turtle seeking them. So maybe their magic is pretty extensive, although i see them living simply mostly due to resource management. Probably the extent of what they do is controlled fire for utility as well as stimulation of natural plant growth. Or possibly, the reason why plants grow so well on the turtle is because it eats the crystals and the essence is deposited in the shell, making them very valuable to poachers.</div></div>

A figure 8 is not a stable orbit.<br><br>Basically, what this all means is that a planet can be within the larger star's habitable zone while plenty far away from the smaller star, which means the smaller star will provide a fair amount of light and negligible heat.<br><br>Let's see.

        <div class="content"><div class="message"><img style="max-width: 100%;" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v487/Andurin/Telaen.jpg"><br><font size="1"><i>pictured: ch00bs again using a parchment texture to make up for his inability to draw</i></font><br><br><font size="5"><b>Telaen</b></font><br><br>Telaen are the massive terrapin-like creatures known to wander through the _______ rainforest and the Isiyoshindika desert. <br><br><font size="3"><b>Anatomy</b></font><br>While at first, telaen seem fairly similar to the more common, smaller chelonian, further inspection reveals them to be very different.<br><br>The main feature of the telaen that makes them unique is their carapace. Unlike "normal" turtles, a telaen's shell is not made of keratin. About 76% of it is chitin, interweaved with about 16% silicon carbide and 8%  ________ magic crystals. Similarly composed structures also grow out of the shell behind the creature's head, forming "horns", though the percentage of ___________ crystal is even greater in these. Due to the presence of ___________, during a telaen's travels, water tends to gather in a floating sphere between the horns, much like in large formations of natural _________. Atop the creature's head is another "mouth" that allows the telaen to drink at its leisure.<br><br>Another interesting note on the creatures' backs is that they are somewhat concave at the top, creating a natural plateau. The creatures are so large that entire niche ecosystems tend to form there, flourishing due to the shell's natural magic and the creature's source of water.<br><br>The telaen also have compound eyes, hypothesized to be "tuned" for seeking out ________ formations. The creature respirates through 4 holes at the base of its neck, under its shell and protected from the harsh Isiyoshindikan dust storms. These holes alternate breathing, two at a time, into four lungs, effectively giving the telaen a constant flow of oxygen. Two massive hearts beat, again alternating, to push blood throughout the creature's body. Telaen support themselves on 6 legs, though usually, they prefer to rest on their bellies. <br><br><font size="3"><b>Behavior</b></font><br>Normally, telaen hibernate alone within the ____________ rainforests, occasionally moving its head to siphon water through its top mouth or to eat nearby vegetation. Every few weeks, the creature gets up and moves to a new location to rest again for a few more weeks.<br><br>Due to the low number of telaen and the vast area in which they inhabit, different members cross paths very rarely. When they do, the results are often mundane, with the two giving each other what can be described as a simple greeting before moving on to different portions of the forest so as not to interfere with each other's eating area. However, occasionally, when a male and a female telaen meet, they may decide to form a mating bond. The two will travel and hibernate together until mating season arrives.<br><br>Once the time is right, the two travel into the desert and automatically begin seeking natural aquasphere formations. Given their slow speed, and the fact that they do not stop at the first aquasphere they find, the journey can take months. Upon finding a satisfactory outcropping of _______ crystals, the two dig underneath the water run off. The female then lays a softshelled egg in the magic rich, moist environment, and the male externally fertilizes it, and the couple bury their hopefully gestating baby. After that, the two part ways.<br><br>Sometimes solitary telaen will begin the journey into the desert, if they have gone enough years without forming a bond. The hope is to find a worthy mate in the pass between the _______ mountain range, where the Isiyoshindika desert and _________ rainforest meet. <br><br><font size="3"><b>Ecosystems</b></font><br>Telaen have lifespans of over 300 years, during which time, an entire ecosystem can be born. In the early years, fast growing mosses and lichens spread over the telaen's back. When they die, they create layers of soil, primarily in the flat region of the shell, and after several decades, wind swept spores and seeds settle in, eventually forming a simple ecosystem of shrubbery. At this point, avian creatures begin eating the flora, bringing with them bigger seeds, which eventually take root as small trees.<br><br>Of note are that several telaen are home to tribes of people, referred to as Telaenians.<br><br><font size="3"><b>Telaenians</b></font><br>Telaenians are humans who originally lived in or near the rainforest, eventually moving atop the telaen to protect themselves from the dangerous environment. Each tribe gives their home telaen a name, usually from attempting to "speak" to the creature on first contact. Names are formed as follows:<br><br>Telaen are called by appending their "spoken" name to the word telaen. ex) "Telaen'fil"<br>People are called by their given name followed by their family name followed by their telaen's name. ex) Jillian Fil<br><br>The tribes are structure mainly around a Speaker or a group of Speakers who communicate with the creature. They do not regard the telaen's voice as divine or imperative; rather they only wish to understand their home and make sure that it is not troubled by anything major.<br><br>Since birds are the only animal that makes it up to a telaen's back, Telaenian food consists primarily of the native vegetation (mushrooms, berries, wild rice) and poultry. Occasional hunting parties are sent down to the surface to bring back more significant or different foods.<br><br>A telaen's back is not an endlessly large area; indeed it can only support a certain amount of people for a limited time. As such, children often go through a rite of passage upon reaching a certain age. When a small number of children are no longer considered children, they are sent out into the forests or desert to find their home on another telaen, though they are welcome to come back if they find no other after a few months. This upbringing tends to create hardened adults, able to survive and fight through the dangerous wilds.<br><br>Magic use is limited, despite their home's natural affinity to it. The people mostly practice controlled fires for their own convenience as well as stimulation of plant growth for small farms.<br><br><br><br><br><br>tl;dr - big ass turtle thing.<br><br>PS. feel free to shoot down any ideas.<br><br>PPS. hot DAMN that is a lot of words how did i even do it.</div></div>

Valued higher are the bones, though the method to working the even tougher material is a well kept secret by ____________.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">A comment made earlier by ch00bs when we were discussing turning the Endless into the asteroid belt was how would they get there. Same way they got to it when it was beneath the world. The hot air balloons. <br><br>I also think that the the way the company is situated in the Rocks is that they have made one massive city with a few satellite cities around it, then as you get farther away from that cluster (in either direction) company presences dwindles down until you're just coming up along the random out post here or there. <br><br>The tribe however (since they leave the stones as they are naturally) have several smaller Villages that litter their territory. <br><br>The large expanse between the company's region and the tribes territory are called the Wild Rocks, these areas are untouched by either group, this is where some of the largest rock formations occur, forming twisted labyrinths as vegetation has spread from rock to rock forming large patches of mostly traversal land. Here is where the highest concentration of wildlife resides. <br><br>The tribe regularly sends hunting parties out into the Wild Rocks to hunt animals for food. However, the company isn't big on that, instead they eat mostly preserved meats and Jerky they get from the mainland.<br><br>Ok, so while the Company has their hot air balloons for getting around and such they do have one massive blimp. It is actually three blimps in a row (nose to tail) which lift a massive barge like structure. Every two years the floating barge makes the trip from the main company city, loaded with the spoils of two years worth of mining, to the main land. They visit a few of the closest cities. The first stop is almost always to trade for common goods (cloths, materials, and other non-perishables), the next few stops are dedicated to accumulating a large amount of jerky and preserved meats (unless they can get the fresh meat for a good price, in which they jerk-ify it while making there way to the next city.

        <div class="content"><div class="message"><i>They say that the creatures of the Dark Fringe were a sorcerer's failed attempt to bring back his deceased child. They say that when he pulled his child's soul back from the land of the dead, he forgot to close the door, and was soon killed by malevolent spirits. The evil poured fourth into the physical realm, entirely destroying the city of ____________ before a band of magicians stopped them, closed the gate between life and death, and, unable to kill what was already dead, simply banished the spirits into the Dark Fringe.<br><br>This is an old tale which may or may not be true. What we know is true, however, is that every so often a piece of the Fringe falls from the sky, bringing with it a small band of gruesome creatures that attack anyone nearby. If they fought to kill, we might be relieved, for death makes everything so much simpler. However, these creatures, no, these monsters, have been known to ensnare and eviscerate without taking life, instead taking unwilling prisoners back with them to the sky. Our only saving grace is that these attacks only consist of a handful of monsters. Unfortunately, each individual is worth five men in battle. They are hardened and fireproof, as evidenced by their ability to ride a flaming rock to the surface. <br><br>This is what we face. This is what you will face. Welcome to the _________ of the Falling Sky.</i><br><br>I can't decide if I like Shepherds of the Falling Sky or Order of the Falling Sky or Legion of the Falling Sky. Still working on a Badass Creed.<br><br>About the Order/Shepherds/Legion:<br><br>The Falling Sky keeps a large observatory near the peak of _______ (the big mountain) that continuously watches Aleta's ring for any signs of falling. Also, scattered throughout the main continent (ie not the islands) are towers which house a small number of soldiers and much simpler telescopic arrays. Should any of these bases see a piece of the Fringe coming to the ground, they immediately use sending glyphs to contact the nearest tower to ready a defense.<br><br>The Shepherds/Order/Legion are known for their any-means-necessary outlook when fighting the creatures. Though many members still consider chemistry taboo, some individuals have chosen to use explosives and rifles when fighting. Many of the mages practice blood magic, which, while not flat out taboo, is still considered a risky science due to the potential health problems when eating ______ crystal.<br><br>Every soldier has a glyph tattooed over his or her heart and a gemmed knife. If one is about to fall in battle, he or she will often commit suicide rather than get taken back to the sky. Stabbing the glyph with the knife transfers their remaining life force to the gem, which can then be used by still living members of the order in their fight. Besides enchanted weaponry, several golems have been constructed, though powering the behemoths requires a good deal of souls.<br><br>EDIT: I think I'm going to cancel out "Legion" because these guys also act as astronomers and are responsible for star charts and such. Maybe Seekers of the Falling Sky? Keepers? So many possibilities.</div></div>

It's now down to Order and Shield of the Falling Sky. He mentioned that they'd be the baddest of the bad, and I agree, though like I said about the questionable methods, I'm thinking that they're not 100% trusted by the major powers, or even by the people. They're grudgingly respected, or something.<br><br>As far as the normal populace, biscuit mentioned tunics and togas and armor. I'm not a fan of togas.

Sort of a 'freedom at any cost' outlook. <br><br>And with that in mind, it really works for the kind of enemy we're fighting. How do you engage an enemy that doesn't play by the rules? How do you scare an enemy that knows no fear, can't be broken or routed? When every demon that touches ground can only slay an massacre until it is stone dead, what other choice do you have but to fight them as close and as brutally as possible? Perhaps they were commissioned by the world powers to be the heroes they could not themselves be; or they're a whole organization of Batmans. Loved by some, hated by most, a secret order of men and women who exist not because they're wanted, but because they're <i>needed[\i]. <br><br>And if not secret, then maybe a society like Masons or Knights of Columbus. </i></div></div>

Hm, no, they'd probably be at least slightly visible so that they can call upon aid should the need arise. <br><br>And with such little overall support, they'd probably be willing to take whatever help they can get, meaning they get a lot of criminals.

"I'm a member of The Order" or "I am one of the Shields"... probably the latter.<br><br>Shields of the Falling Sky it is.<br><br>Now that I've realize that there are a lot of criminals in there, I'm wondering how many of them have the resolve to stab themselves in the heart if they get captured. Hm.<br><br>Ok so that mental image of a Shield morphing into a giant eagle, flying over a Fringebeast, demorphing in midair, and landing on the creature's head with his hammer has now added an extra motion. Since that hammer will probably at best daze the creature, the Shield immediately drops the hammer instead of going for another long wind up, pulls out two pistols and starts shooting the shit out of it. Too bad there are no automatic weapons in this world. Looks like this move is being reserved for Rie.</div></div>

If it's a large scale invasion, they're expected to hold the line until heavy reinforcements arrive. <br><br>Members are just working-class individuals who do like any other volunteer emergency service and work shifts, hold meetings, train weekly.</div></div>

Shit.<br><br>I'm trying to figure out how to make the Shield's soul-forfeit a mechanism rather than a ritual. I was thinking a metal button over the heart that's basically a self-destruct, but that would give the Shields a weak spot. Or maybe... A glyph on the hand, a metal pad over the heart. On touching the hand to the metal pad, it transmutes the pad into a spike, skewers the heart, and transfers the soul to a bracelet or necklace. (dogtags)<br><br>I was also thinking that they don't turn away criminals, but they DO give everyone a couple years training from hell. Intermediate magic study, advanced combat training, advanced astronomy, etc. Make all the new recruits memorize the night sky on any given day so that they can call out disturbances. In exchange for this, a Shield's past is legally dismissed and various other benefits, maybe like being able to operate outside the law during a Fall. So I guess it'll mostly be criminals who are atoning, or who did REALLY bad things. Or it could even be the equivalent of the death sentence in one kingdom.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message"><i>A manuscript sent in for editing</i><br><br><font size="5">The Fundamentals of Magic</font><br>by Dr. Thomas Perennial, Ph.D.<br><br><font size="4">Chapter 1 – An Introduction</font><br><br>At its most basic, what we call “magic” is simply understanding and manipulating the underlying flow of the world. Take, for example, something we all take for granted nowadays: turning on the lights. You walk into a dark room, grope for the light pad for a minute, then press it, and suddenly the room is no longer dark due to a floating flame. But what goes on behind the scenes? How does that flame appear and sustain itself?<br><br>In this text you will learn all this and much more as we study the fundamentals of magic and their applications in the real world. This chapter will give a brief overview of the types of magic.<br><br><font size="3">Part 1 – Magite</font><br><br>Magic would not be possible if it were not for the existence of one relatively rare resource: magite. Magite is a naturally occurring mineral found throughout Aleta that causes the world's “flow” to change directions. Perhaps the best way to describe “flow” is that it is the laws and equations that govern how the world <i>usually</i> works. However, careful application of magite can bend these laws and change these equations in a predictable manner.<br><br><font size="3">Part 2 – Symbolic Magic</font><br><br>Turning on the lights is simple application of symbolic magic. On contact with the lightpad, a symbol drawn with magite takes the energy from your palm striking the surface, plus a small amount of body heat, and turns it into a large spike of thermal energy where the lamp is located. This energy would be nothing if not for a secondary glyph drawn inside the lamp that continually moves ambient oxygen and hydrogen particles into the flame to burn. <i>Editor's note – what the hell is oxygen and hydrogen?</i><br><br>This is the most basic form of magic. Symbols are drawn using magite chalk, and through the shapes and lines drawn, the flow can be altered. If you were to look at your light pad and your lamp, you would see that the symbols are all arranged along a triangular shape. This is the fundamental form of symbolic magic. It signifies change, and the three points act to focus and contain the magic. Of course, there are more complex shapes available to use for more specialized purposes. Chapter 2 goes more into the basics of symbolic magic, detailing how the more commonly used glyphs work to alter the flow.<br><br><img style="max-width: 100%;" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v487/Andurin/symbolicmagic.jpg"><br><i>Editor's Note – You are so cliché with writing on a recycled bag. We have better paper than that!</i><br><br><font size="3">Part 3 – Mind Magic</font><br><br>The second most common type of magic one may come across is magic cast from the mind. A man gifted with strong mental prowess can direct the flow by focusing through a raw magite crystal. Studies have shown that this happens because a man's thoughts harmonize in certain ways with the crystals. Years of study and meditation are required to make any practical use of this type of magic. As with all forms of magic, one must have a deep understanding of how the world works. However, unlike symbols drawn on a surface, the mind is prone to change. One must be able to focus on symbols and words with perfect clarity or else a spell can go horribly wrong. More often than not, a mage performing mind magic will use incantations and gestures to focus his mind. Chapter 10 covers the basics of mental magic.<br><br><font size="3">Part 4 – Movement Magic</font><br><br>The third most commonly used form of magic is Movement Magic. This type of magic uses the physical movement of magite crystals to alter the flow. Unless in possession of complex mechanisms, magic done in this way is less flexible than mental magic and less intricate than symbolic magic. However, it is much easier to cast spells with movement than with the mind, and one is not bound to a hard surface in order to draw. Chapter 7 goes into more depth.<br><br><font size="3">Part 5 – Harmonic Magic</font><br><br>Though not common in any sense of the word, one noteworthy way of casting spells lies in the mentioned ability to harmonize with magite crystals. Gifted bards have been able to cast spells simply by singing or playing an instrument and harmonizing their music with the crystal. This is outside the scope of this text.<br><br><font size="3">Part 6 – Blood Magic</font><br><br>Ingesting magite in any kind of way is generally a poor idea. It has been known to cause hallucinations, mental retardation, insanity, and even death in not so rare occasions. Milder symptoms range from fevers to mood swings. However, upon consumption, and once the magite has dissolved into the blood stream, a mage becomes a walking occurrence of magite. He can perform movement magic without needing a crystal in his hands, and he can draw glyphs  using his blood. Unlike what is commonly spread in rumor, blood magic is not more “powerful” than the other forms. It is slightly more flexible, but at great cost. This is also outside the scope of this text.<br><br><i>Editor's note – Are you sure you even want to mention this shit in here?</i></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message"><font size="4">Advanced Combat Magic – A Look Into Chaos</font><br>by Magister Nadia Ferumdoit<br>Pelantesque Court Spellsword<br><br>Using magic in war requires a slightly different mindset than when using it every day. Mundane use of magic usually consists of very controlled spells, carefully calculated and applied beforehand. This approach can work when fighting; for example, the basic fireball simply requires a glyph for heat, fuel, and movement. However, if an enemy were to be on the receiving end of such a spell, he would at best suffer a major burn. Where did the great battlemages get their power to devastate entire armies?<br><br>In early magic classes, a young mage learns that the triangle forms the basis of most utility spells. The three points and three edges provide a stable base while symbolizing change. Later on, one learns that adding or subtracting a point, thus forming a quadrangle or a bar, creates a symbol for constraint. What happens when one more point is added to the square? One creates a pentagon, the symbol for chaos. <br><br>Application of chaos, rather than application of control, forms the basis of most combat magic. Let us examine the fireball example again. If one were to create the heating glyph with a pentagon, the air might flash a series of sparks of differing intensities as opposed to simply raising the temperature. Using a pentagon for fuel would throw out the equations for the flow of oxygen and hydrogen, causing possible explosions as fuel levels in an area fluctuate wildly. What about applying the pentagon to the movement spell? You already have been. Have you ever wondered why you never connect the arrow's head to its tail?It is because movement is inherently chaotic, and by leaving the pieces unconnected, you create five points with two missing edges. Connecting these last two edges causes movement to become highly erratic in most cases.<br><br>Of course, these effects just seem dangerous. Knowing where and when not to apply chaos is very important so as not to hurt unintended people. In this text we will cover the theory behind offensive spells and ways to successfully use them without killing yourself.<br><br><font size="3">Various notes on the different types of magic.</font><br><br>Due to the time requirements for setup, symbolic magic tends to be used solely for enchanting weapons and traps. Usually, the spells are triggered by kinetic force, either by friend or foe. Mind magic tends to only be used by devoted spellcasters behind the frontline where they can concentrate on their spells. Spellswords usually rely on movement magic, powered either by magite bracelets/anklets/collars/rings or blood magic because muscle memory is generally very reliable in the thick of battle.<br><br><hr><br><br><i>An excerpt from the chapter on Movement Magic from the Fundamentals of Magic by Dr. Thomas Perennial</i><br><br>Movement magic usually requires an “activation” of some sort that causes the magite to start vibrating, signaling that a spell is about to be performed. The user has freedom to choose however he causes the activation, so long as the crystals vibrate at the right frequency. Many simply touch two glyphs together to produce a sustained vibration. Several bards have been able to hold a note while moving to cast a spell.</div></div>

I just read through this whole topic while watching TV so I might have glazed over it, if so. I'd like to think there are a small number of holes in the continents since traveling to the edges of one side then to the interior of the other sounds extraordinarily difficult. Some of the holes could have water drain through them to provide the interior of bottomworld some more water. Then again, I like the idea that the exterior of bottomworld provides the interior with the water they need; good dynamics. <br><br>I think scale needs to be discussed a bit, too. In 3D space as well as 2D. How high does the dominant mountain rise? How high above that is the waterball? How high above that is the, <i>teehee</i>, Lifestream? How far away is volcanoworld? How high (low) is said volcano? Since our continent(s) are basically the entire planet + bordering ocean I feel like that landmass needs to be at least as big as a flattened Earth, preferably much bigger. Working out the distance to volcanothemusical is a bit weird for me. Maybe like, the distance satellites are from Earth. Close enough that it's at least feasible to reach, barring Stephen King bugs and inclement weather, but far enough that it's still quite a feat if you do get there.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Hm. Cave system might be kinda cool. Stuff always happens in caves. Maybe most of the topside doesn't know about the bottom side and there are just a couple villages/towns at the entrances to a handful of caves or something.<br><br>I'm all for having a couple drainage holes in the middle of the ocean where there are whirlpools and shit that sailors never come back from because they get crushed and spewed out the bottomside. Or instead of getting crushed they just get horribly lost/disoriented/captured/assimilated.<br><br>In terms of scale, I'm not quite sure for everything. I like the idea of the world itself being gigantic. Would Everest be a good baseline for the main mountain? Although I imagine having a monastery that high up would suck.  I'm suddenly thinking about Ringworld, where there's a gigantic mountain higher than Everest that is actually a meteor impact in the back, so at the top of the mountain is just a giant hole to space.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Well, we can always bend physics and stuff to suit our needs. Like, let's say the troposphere equivalent is much larger than Earth's own. That way we can have the mountain be even larger than Everest yet still have the waterball. Plus, magix.  We could say that different strains of these crystal deposits have different effects on the climate around them. Like, alone they don't have much of an effect other than being warm or cool in your hand but in large (see: huge) deposits they affect the way the air/magic/chi flows around the world in such a way as to cause climate patterns and such. That way we don't have to take make the suns and currents and stuff like that exactly perfect. I mean, being grounded in science is fine but since these people aren't sticking to our science we don't need to either. That could also be an explanation for why bottomland is broken up and stuff. The crystals there are either different or in smaller quantities than those on the surface. That could be why the natives respect them so much and the cause of the tension between them and the miners. Maybe topworld has a bunch of regulations for the mining/gathering of it. It could even be a renewable resource like trees; yeah, it comes back but if you take too much at once shit happens. <br><br>Your meteor reference made me think. What if there's a spot on the world where a sizable asteroid hit the world so it's full of these asteroidemons? I'm thinking along the lines of <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savage_Land">the Savage Land</a> from Marvel comics. Basically, a place apart from the rest of the world where bigass monsters roam. Maybe there's a group dedicated to keeping them trapped there as there are too many critters to be killed outright. PROPHECY TELLS OF A MAN WHO WILL RISE FROM THE SAVAGE LAND TO RID IT OF ITS INFESTATION. Or something like that. I like the idea that the "demons" are coming from "heaven" (asteroid belt) and that means that their "heaven" is volcanoland, which would probably first be considered for "hell." As far as afterlife goes though, I'm kinda stumped. Reincarnation's always neat to work with. Volcanoland could just be souls in limbo waiting for peeps to get born'd so they can float back up. Maybe they have tests/trials/shit they have to do to get back to the living realm. I don't really like that though since that would imply only the best people are alive at any given time. We need some freaks and losers. And since it's a physical place that's home to spiritual beings how do we rectify the space issue? People die a lot. Maybe volcanoland is more like Valhalla where only the best and the bravest go. The rest just sort of become one with the universe or something.<br><br>I'm open for el volcano de sur being something else though. Like, home to some super race or the gateway to something. I dunno.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Ok, so choobles and I were talking on AIM for a while tossing ideas around. Here's a couple we really dig. First, some names.<br><br>jgélðhrn = heldyn (mainland pronunciation/spelling) = space monsters<br>Vígríðr = viggrid (mainland pronunciation/spelling) = island<br><br>Basically that island in the northwest is the site of one of those asteroids hitting Aleta a long time ago. It was a biggun and dug out that lake you see there. There was a metric fuckton of the jgélðhrn/heldyn/spacemonsters on it that started running rampant so the Shields set the place up as a trial by fire for new recruits/potential recruits. The fancy names are what the Shields and so forth call the island/critters and the plain names are what the general populace goes by.<br><br>Anyways, we also thought that, instead of a ring of asteroids around the perimeter of the world, it would be a ring above Aleta. Like, think ice cubes swirling in a big glass. Because of this, only Aleta is hit by them when they fall and the bottomworld is unaffected. We figure that this could be the reason the first bottoms went down there; they wanted a civilization where they didn't have to worry about the jgélðhrn.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Ok this is hella annoying. Whenever I hit alt+numpad4, Firefox AND Chrome decide to interpret it as the hotkey to go back. Meaning I've lost this post twice now while trying to type Jgélðhrn.<br><br>Anyway, so this has to do with Vígríðr and the shit ton of Jgélðhrn that are on it. Initially I thought of making it Australia in that particularly egregious criminals are sent there to get abducted by Jgélðhrn but that would be redundant with the Shields. <br><br>Soooo 90 and I figured that Shields just conscript them particularly egregious criminals and commandeer their stuff. For example, Telaen poachers. Those guys have to be badasses to take down a full grown Telaen. Shields come in as a sort of asshole global police force, beat the shit out of the poachers, and take all the harvested Telaen shell since "it would be wasted to just throw away". Any of the poachers that survive are given the option to either get conscripted or get killed right there.<br><br>If they choose to get conscripted, they get sent straight to Vígríðr. Maybe they're given the option to say good bye to loved ones (if they have any) and buy supplies. But supplies would be moot since they're getting dropped on the island for an entire year. Anyway, the criminals are rounded up (not limited to poachers. All criminals are welcome. And I guess people who volunteered) get their names taken away, their heads shaved, and their asses dropped onto Vígríðr. Maybe a handful of official Shields are dropped, too, to monitor or thin the crowd or something. Idk.<br><br>A year goes by, the Shields pick up the survivors, and then give them training from hell and make them memorize all the stars in the sky. There's probably some test to check whether the experience has harrowed the recruit enough to make them willingly take up the Shield name, and that they aren't just joining so they can stay alive, or at least that's not the main reason.<br><br>Pass the training, and you finally get a name back, but it's not your old name. Some test or ritual or whatever is done and the recruit gets a name along the lines of "Silent Bear", possibly lowercase because "a man is not defined by his name, but by his deeds" and is now a full fledged badass anti-hero. Old crimes are officially forgiven, and they now enjoy a small amount of diplomatic immunity and grudging respect from the populace. <br><br>So revisiting the dead soul thing again, their life force is used primarily to power massive golems. It takes several souls to get the constructs to move. These guys follow orders perfectly and don't have any remnants of their previous lives. Each golem is given the title "Jotunn" and the golem army's motto is "In death, service." <br><br><font size="1">I'm still considering giving each golem a pilot just so I can have super mecha.</font></div></div>

It is one of Aleta's most popular sports.<br><br>The game is played on a 50 meter long rectangular field, which can consist of a variety of materials. Aleta's most famous arena has a clay floor. At either end of the field are two goals; a large 7x1.5m one is positioned on the ground while a smaller 1x1m goal sit atop. Officially, there is no designated keeper, though some teams have opted to train them.<br><br>Players are allowed to control the ball with any part of their body, as long as they do not hold the ball with their hands for more than 3 seconds. The ball must not be under “explicit hand control” for another 10 seconds before it can be held again. Additionally, one may not hold the ball at all within 10 meters of the opposing goal.

Penalties are only called if a player is completely incapacitated for over one minute. A player may receive up to three penalties before being ejected for the rest of the game. Additionally, players may not tackle one another or attack from behind. A tackle is defined as grappling another player and pinning them to the ground. Typically the only protection worn are leather shin and forearm guards, used both to fend off attacking players and to strike the ball with increased force.<br><br>Traditionally, the ball is made with regular leather panels stitched around a magically inflated cow bladder.<br><br>Tower is professionally played in a league in the northern country of _________, where teams come from the individual fiefdoms.

The goal of the game is to cross into the other team's territory, take their designated bear skull, and bring it back to your designated home area, all while simultaneously guarding your own team's skull.<br><br>An alternative version of skull has no teams, and instead, players individually try to keep the skull for as long as possible. Sometimes, small squads are used.<br><br>Fighting is only to incapacitate the other person. Broken bones and knocking out are allowed so long as the intent is not to kill.

The green area can be made on the fly, or if anyone wants it, they can call it.<br><br>Quick summary of the northern territory: <br>__<u>No name as of yet, obviously</u>___ was up until recently a loose confederation of smaller fiefdoms that usually traded and occasionally waged unofficial civil wars on trivial matters. However, in recent decades, many of the outlying patriarchs and matriarchs declared their states independent of the central monarchy. As the country broke apart, the current monarch refused to start a civil war over the matter, so one of his senators, Matriarch Irino, killed the queen, exiled all other unsupportive senators, had their respective fiefs burned, and made it her goal to take control back for the throne. <br><br>With this news, Patriarch Solus, lord of Solum-Se, began to unite the independent border states in order to fight off the central armies. After a decade of defense and calling the independent states to action, the rebel army marched on the capital and put it under siege for a year. In the ensuing battles, both Solus and Irino died, though by that time, Solus had united the majority of the country. The remaining states loyal to Irino surrendered to the deceased Solus and Solum-Se was declared the new capital. As of the current day, soldiers are still on their way to their respective homes.<br><br>Of note is that the Shields refused to intervene, and some of the universities refused to send aid to either side as well. Interestingly, Nadia Ferumdoit of the Pelantesque Court, ______'s biggest and most prestigious university, did fight, and against the rebellion at that. Despite her actions, Pelantesque was officially neutral in the war, and so funding was not withdrawn, though the Magister's tenure is currently in question.<br><br><font size="1">lolStealthCharIntro.</font><br><br>The main religion revolves around two deities: the Giver and the Taker. The Giver is responsible for creation and especially the aquasphere atop Mount Fauxlympus. The Taker is responsible for death and taking the water as it falls off Aleta. Water is an especially strong symbol of the faith. After death, they believe that the body must be given to a body of water so that the spirit can travel through it and find its final resting place in the Taker's arms. The relationship between the two deities is not antagonistic; it is an accepted fact that destruction must occur in order for new life to be born.<br><br>----<br><br><font color="red"><font size="5">ANYWAY. IMPORTANT STUFF THAT YOU SHOULD NOW DEF READ IF YOU ARE PLANNING ON PARTICIPATING IN ANY KIND OF WAY.</font></font><br><br>This is regarding the format. I said in the OP that each area would have its own topic, and so plots could come and go and change area and generally be really confusing. But I dunno if I still want to do that, or if anyone else would like to conform to that format.<br><br>A pro that having each area be its own topic is that it would allow places to be all described really nice in the OP and then get continually fleshed out as things happen in them. The first potential problem I see with this, though, is that the size of an area need to be agreed upon first. Like I could make a topic called "Solusland" and that would just be the entire northern country, but that wolud be kind of silly because it would be so general. Alternatively, I could make "Solum-Se Marketplace" which would allow for sweet detailing, but then the board would be littered with these topics, and it would eventually hard to find the ones you want. My last idea for this is to have separate subboards for each country (ie Solusland, Vigrid) and then have more specific topics within each, but that seems slightly clutterful.<br><br>The for-real last option is to just make it a normal RP style, make wiki pages for each place, and just put a link to the list in a sticky with other important info.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Ok, just read everything I have missed.<br><br>Here are my ideas –<br><br><b>Regarding the Shields.</b><br><br>So, hopefully we are still merging ideas and such but a lot of things I read gave me these ideas. Alright, so I like how they recruit the criminals/poachers (death or death in service) but how do they get normal people. Well I will get to that after I explain this next part. I see the Shields as a “large” organization but with constantly dwindling numbers. Sure they have boosts in membership here in there but for the most part they face things that would cause most people to shit themselves. So, because of the horrible odds they face, their numbers stay about the same. Because of this they don’t have the show of force they’d like. <br><br>Also since they are like a civilian police force (I think the most badass neighborhood watch <i>ever</i>) Each town has one for the most part. I see it as when the Shields were first forming up they went around and offered protection to all the towns they could. A lot rejected them but some were like sure ok. Once people saw what they could do more towns changed their tunes. I figure, the Shields being what they are will accept any town. Based on a few criteria they decide how many Shields will be stationed in such town. Size of town, population, and history of attacks from Fringe Beasts all factor. If a town is large but has little to no history of attacks, they will station 2-3 Shields and maybe one Golem Shield. If it’s large town and lots of attacks, the number will be larger. They will always assign at least one person to a town they extend protection to. I figure they always have a few living at an out post those turtles pass by. That way of a new turtle civilization is starting up he can join them and be their Shield. <br><br>I also think there are a few nomadic Shields called Riders. They are a subset that ride large bears. When Shields are fully inducted into the order, they are given orders, and assignments, stuff like that, they may be chosen to become a Rider, (also Roaming Shield would be a good title) when they become a rider they are given a young bear. They go through a whole new level of training, learning to live off the land, fight with and care for the bear, and so on. Their purpose is to relay info between the Shields in dif towns, gather information, search for unprotected towns, retrieve the Shield Crystals when they die, and so on. Anything that would fit in with a traveling member of this group. <br><br>Alright, the way a normal person joins the Shields is they have to find a Shield (usually their resident shield if they have one) and become an Apprentice. There is an age minimum, and the person must be healthy and good physically condition. If the Shield accepts them they live with the shield for a year, the sleep when the Shield does, eat when he/she does, and bathe, train, and go wherever the shield does. If the Shield tells them to do something they must do it. The only thing they do not do is fight, mainly because they don’t have the training yet. At anytime a person can quit but that bars them from joining and if they wish to try again at any point it must be with a different member, and they have to start their year over from the beginning. If however they stick with it and make the full year, the Shield will then give them a choice – back out now with no shame or begin real training to become a Shield. If they accept, then they wait till the next Shield Rider comes to town and head out with him/her. When they arrive where all the other new recruits are waiting they are given lodgings and such until they are bunched up with all the criminals and sent for their one year survival training and so on. <br><br>Also I like the Golem idea, but I see these people as warriors. Also, I’ve been playing a lot of SCII lately so I came up with this. When the Shield dies and becomes the crystal, they can use it in one of two way, imbue it into a Shield Weapon or make a golem. Weapons using the crystal are stronger and have “attributes” if a normal person tries to use it the crystal goes dormant until another Shield uses it. If they make a golem they can either make a stone golem, usually 7 feet tall and mainly a frontline fighter, or they can make a crystal golem, usually 4-5 feet tall and a caster. What determines this is whether the crystal yielded a large amount of magic power or was mostly void of power. Crystals with low magic quality are made into stone golems and high magic yielding crystals are fused with naturally occurring magic crystal. Stone golems are larger because they need to be and stone and rock is abundant. Crystal golems are smaller because they need to be able to move around faster and crystal is expensive so they want to use as little as possible. Stone Golems tend to be bulky and Crystal Golems tend to be lanky and thin. <br><br>K this is where the SCII idea comes up, rarely a crystal is recovered that yields a massive amount of magic potential. When this happens they make a special kind of golem called a Tower Shield Golem, these are usually made of a combination of armor and naturally occurring magic crystal (I forgot the term for it so that’s why I keep calling it magic crystal lol) these Tower Shield Golems use only one Shield death crystal and when they “wake up” they retain the thoughts, feelings, emotions, memories, and personality of the Shield who yielded the crystal (think like Alphonse from FMA but with the dragoon concept in the original SC). Their height is usually determined by the size of armor they are fitted with; typically they are pretty basic looking sets of armor. The Tower Golem has the ability to “refit” new armor on but it takes them out of commission for a few days. Once a Tower Shield Golem has served as such for 50 years they usually get to commission custom armor made to their specifications. They typically serve in the larger towns or helping train new recruits. They are crazy strong, while a normal golem is equivalent to 5 or so men, a Tower Shield Golem is worth about 10 or so men. They have an active duty life of about 150 years, at which point the naturally occurring magic crystals that make them begin to grow. They can usually buy about 10-20 years more but filling down the portions of the crystal that begin growing but after about that long all the crystals in their body begin to grow. Usually, before they lose their mobility, they make the journey to the Shield Barracks, or whatever the Shield Headquarters is called, and take up residence somewhere on the grounds. As long lived as they are, they have a certain humor in their death. They know that when the crystallizing process if finished they will finally die for good, they also know that the crystallized golems are left wherever they completely crystallize at (kinda like a monument). Sometimes they pose sometimes they go to their favorite spot. There are currently 6 fully crystallized Tower Shield Golems on the grounds – Two in the courtyard (one sitting on a bench looking upward and another standing in a corner), one lying in a bed where all the new recruits are housed (mainly to creep out the newbie’s as he put it), one standing watch on a parapet over looking the training grounds, and two in the main hall (the thing is here that there were two Tower Shield Golems alive at the same time (usually doesn’t happen) and they had a friendly rivalry. When the first began to crystallize he wanted to look dramatic and powerful, so he posed himself in the main hall near the entrance pointing his sword upwards. When his friend began to crystallize as well (a few years after his friend had died from complete crystallization) he climbed the wall of the great hall, found the strongest beam he could and strong himself up with a noose right above his friend. Until he died of complete crystallization he’d heckle the other Shields in the main hall (though he knew when to behave) when they asked him why he did it he said when the rope gives out he’ll crash into his friend and they’ll both shatter, ending their rivalry in a draw.) There is a 7th Tower Shield Golem on the grounds currently in the crystallizing process. He sits on a balcony overlooking the fields and farms near the barracks. He’s about half way through the process and still has about another twenty years left until he fully crystallizes. Until they fully crystallize, Tower Shield Golems can still talk; give advice, joke, and have a good time. Even once their armor is fully encased they usually live on another 6-10 years. <br><br>The crystal “prison” that grows around them is completely clear (though it dose add a blue glowey twinge) the armor spreads out slightly, but still maintains the pose they were in. There have been 16 recorded Tower Shield Golems since the creation of the Shields, 7 of them have either crystallized or are crystallizing in the Shield Headquarters while 5 have fallen in battle. When that happens their armor is put on display in the shield headquarters in what has come to be called the ‘Trophy Room’. 1 Tower Shield Golem returned to his home town and Crystallized there looking over the grave of his wife (who was killed by Fringe Beasts). The final two both disappeared toward the ends of their lives. It is unknown what happened to them, whether they fell in battle or crystallized in some far away place. It has been a long time since there was a Tower Shield Golem. <br><br>Damn, I wanted to get to some stuff about the Endless and the Tribe and the Company. Stupid work, why is the library busy on a Friday, wtf. Shouldn’t these kids be outside, on a computer? Anyways, what do you guys think? do we like? <br></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Yesss bears. I love the Roaming Shields.<br><br>Regarding the residence of Shields, I was talking to Biscuit, and he said that the shields are probably specialists, aka tank-healer-dps type deal, so the smallest group they'd probably have is two (warrior-mage, and if one dies, the other can bring news). That said, I like the idea of assigning them to cities. I'm also thinking that more major cities with a large Shield group have a designated tower outside the city, away from the lights so that they can more effectively watch the Fringe at night.<br><br>PS. Fringebeats are now known as heldyn (it's similar to the Norse word for heathen... and it's similar to the word heathen). There's a more complicated word that I don't feel like typing. Magic crystal is magite. Pretty straightforward there.<br><br>Tower Shield Golems is really cool. I love the idea, though I'm going to hope that people just keep them as NPCs, though I wouldn't explciity bar anyone from having one of those characters.<br><br>Apprentice-ship is a really good idea. It makes perfect sense.<br><br>And this is in the wiki and not here, but Gvera City is kind of like the Telaenian capital. It's a graveyard city, with high walls fashioned out of bone and carapace, and every telaen passes through or near the city at least once a year. There are several graveyard cities spread through the western rainforst (The Alurile), and a telaen almost always ends their life there if they die of natural causes.</div></div>

It is one of Aleta's most popular sports.<br><br>The game is played on a 50 meter long rectangular field, which can consist of a variety of materials. Aleta's most famous arena has a clay floor.

The ball must not be under “explicit hand control” for another 10 seconds before it can be held again. Additionally, one may not hold the ball at all within 10 meters of the opposing goal.

Stuff that, if done with animals, would count as the most perverse of tortures? Y'know, like bonsai stuff cranked up to eleven, plants engineered to die out specifically to carry out certain purposes (like warping what would normally be a long living tree that yields fruit for many years so that it produces a massive yield, but burns itself out in a single season), hybridizing plants in bizarre and unsettling ways, etc. I'm also thinking something along the lines of them actually being humans, but having found some way to graft vegetation into their own bodies.<br><br>I dunno, just another part of an idea that Choobs might be able to use.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">I could see them being subspecies or distantly related. They're just plants. Without the aid of the creatures they'd eventually die out, either by being destroyed by people or other animals, or by burying themselves and wasting away. The creatures that defend them would also die out without the plant because they'd lose their food source, their shelter and part of their defense.<br><br>It's obvious that others would want the plant destroyed though, it's a highly invasive species. Once it moves into an area it casts it's spores, which quickly kill all native plant-life just by landing on them and smothering/crushing them. An interesting possibility would be the spores/seeds landing on the back of a Telaenian and then taking over it's ecosystem while spreading to every place the Telaenian goes. <br><br>At least they rarely develop seeds, otherwise they'd quickly take over the country-side. I suppose that if you're really worried about them then we could just put them on the northern archipelago where they'd slowly be spreading from island to island.</div></div>

And the Reaching Islands (the Archipelago) is now medium-sized-ocean-creature shapeshifters?<br><br>As far as the shapeshifters go, I'm thinking that any individual can only do one transformation. Maybe it's hereditary, or maybe it's learned, but maybe it also creates class barriers. Shark shapeshifters are usually warriors, dolphins are __________, and octopus/squids are workers and craftsmen. Dunno why they'd need warriors unless each island fights each other. Also, living is done half on the island and half underneath the water in bubble thingies. I dunno. I'll describe it better if someone wants to jump off this diving platform I just built.<br><br>With Lee's kids, I see them as being highly territorial with a thick wall made of intertwined trees around their borders. Opening the trees can only be done by another Petalaean (working name unless people like it) or someone who knows the spell, and the branches just part wherever. These cats use magic specifically tuned for growing life.<br><br>For anyone that i've PMed/IMed about the Symbol of God storyline, this whole "shaping life" may play a role in the plot.<br><br>Anyway, ambulatory plants. Thinking they could be the Petalaens means of transportation, both for people and objects. Instead of the wheel, they just figured out how to get these plants to move in the direction they want.<br><br>I dunno what else I can do with making them abhorrent, though. I guess the grafting plants into them works (oh hello ysengrim) and making plants that kill themselves to produce huge yields. Maybe they make the evil-spore-plants do something, too, so they like playing with fire.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Originally the fact that many of them were clannish nomads was why it was so much larger than it needed to be. The original reason why they moved there was because the land was very similar to the Ovora that had been told throughout the generations, causing them to believe that one of their gods had created the land for them, this would justify them settling over such a large area as well as why they would fight to keep it when it would clearly be a losing battle. <br><br>(Talitia was settled in a similar fashion. Talitia is the name of a mountain and a god that was said to live there, the nobles claimed that Talitia told them to settle there and they'd be protected, even though the priests denied ever receiving any such message. The Ovorans didn't receive such a message from any gods when they went to Paldeta, they just belief it was made for them, though I haven't decided who they think did it. Also I these gods aren't necessarily real, Ovorans just believe in them)<br><br>EDIT: Also on the wiki I'm going to change it from "Talitians" to Ovorans. I'll sum up their mutual history there then create a page for the Talitians and another for the modern Ovorans<br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>(This idea is for the island that you mistook for Ovora) <br><br>Collida is a matriarchal country that resides in a small island chain in the  Kynen Ocean. The islands are named after whoever their current female ruler is. males are believed to be inferior, due to their inability to directly reproduce, and are kept as slaves, manual laborers and foot soldiers. Women act as officers, politicians, ambassadors, land owners, physicians and teachers. <br><br>Men, at an early age, are taught to be subservient to the women and they are often sold into slavery or to businesses as wage workers once they are no longer dependent on their mothers for life. Because male Collidans, as with male humans, can breed with any number of partners they are allowed to be handled roughly. The "best" men are sent to an island and used purely for breeding stock. <br><br>Female Collidans stay with the family from birth onward. Many times they carry the same name as their mothers and grandmothers but have slight changes in the way their names are spoken so that they can easily be identified. Once a female Collidan reaches physical maturity she may not be touched by a male unless he has permission (jobs such as bodyguards and breeding are implied to have touching involved when necessary, but harsh penalties are still brought down on these men.) The touching or harsh handling of a pregnant Collidan is met with immediate death and burning, unless it is done by another woman, which results in fines and possible jail time (unless the woman herself is pregnant). <br><br>The island of Ghemelda is the only exception to these rules.  This island is where all the trade with other nations is done and is largely populated by male Collidans, as well as members of whatever country/race happen to trade their. <br><br>Collida frequently sends out ambassadors to other nations, where they attempt to bring women into power in those nations, as well as promote pro-female and anti-male legislation. <br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>(Still another idea I had that I've been toying with bringing up for awhile now)<br><br>Kvidera (Temporary name, unless I decide to keep it like this)<br><br>Kvidera was once a large continent on the northern end of Aleta. Most of the continent stretched out into space and was sparsely populated, except for the edge that reached into the Reaching Ocean. To help bring life into the farther sections of the continent several Alasijian Shepards were brought onto the continent. In one of the farthest corners of Kvidera the Shepards found a large amount of magite. At that site they created another aqua sphere, though it was one that was much much weaker and more temperamental than the one on Sky's Reach. <br><br>For a time the people of Kvidera prospered. Slowly an ocean spread out and joined with the Reaching Ocean, though it was no where near it's size or it's depth.<br><br>One day a meteor shower came close to Aleta, striking the continent of Kvidera many times and eventually caused it to shatter, forming the islands now known as the Reaching Islands. The largest chunk of Kvidera, which still held the new aquasphere, was pushed away from Aleta and soon became it's "moon", where it would occasionally cause a small eclipse during the summer.   <br><br>Kvidera does not enjoy a warm summer time though. Due to it's distance from Aleta, it doesn't have as much atmosphere around it. As such, the island is almost entirely frozen. in the early days after the separation from Aleta the people created large wards which captured the heat from the suns and warmed the land slightly. In the summer, around these wards, small crops are grown. Farther out hardy trees grow and attempt to survive the harsh cruel winters. During the winter food is "hunted" from the animals that hibernate during this time, but the numbers of these animals are dwindling and many fear that there will soon be mass starvation. <br><br>The aquasphere that used to bring much needed water to Kvidera has frozen over and instead brings a near constant snowfall to the land.<br><br>Next to the wards the people live in anything that can be assembled to form shelter, stone, wood, even snow and ice. The few hunting camps that dot Kvidera are made entirely of snow and ice. Many people wear fur and some animals are kept near the wards just so that they can have a good supply of fur, but these animals are small because there is not much food that can be given to them, as such little meat is obtained from them when they are slaughtered. <br><br>Not everything has turned for the worse for the Kviderans though. Many of them have adapted to the cooler temperatures and can now withstand the areas right outside of the wards protection, though not forever. </div></div>

Because of this, no mainstream body will screw with them, though the brigands and hunters will still start trouble with them.<br><br>The Petalaens, despite this efficient and almost unstoppable weapon of war, have not pursued any conquest. They see their nation's form as being a perfect aesthetic ideal, and bothering to expand their borders would mean destroying the artfully constructed borders of their nation.<br><br>Also, another idea to go with these folks having the giant hedge: Using the same techniques as they do for grafting plants, they build criminals directly into the walls of their nation, facing outwards. They can use the criminals as sentries, and the obviously unpleasant experience is visible to all outsiders, a sign of what happens when the nation is slighted.

I'd say "something french" but I'm already using that as a base for the plant-people. Maybe Italian would be a good place to start. Or maybe mess with the word "Amazon" or "amor." In fact, looking into Amazon legends might be a good place to start. But I have to go to work, so I'll do it later.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Just gonna jump on the World Building Bandwagon.  Man that band is playing pretty loudly in general!<br><br>Regardless;  Ever since I saw that volcano back on page -2 I had a good idea for it and it's been buzzing about inside my head like some kind of ADD gnat.<br><br>What if that stuff coming out of it wasn't lava?  What if, instead, it was <i>water</i>  The whole concept of just hoping the water would come back to the top struck me as kind of ridiculous.  But what if, instead, the water that was pulled down off of the earth and into the volcano-type-thing because of a deposite of the magic crystals?  The water would be pulled down into it and then, if turned into a vaporous material, re-condensed by cold as opposed to heat.  Cold enough to turn the water vapor into water, but not enough to freeze the water inside of it.  The water could be propelled by a triangle-esque symbol formed by three deposits of crystals placed at two spots on the base and a ring of them at the top.  The water's movment (pre-determined by the crystals) would arc back up to the top, adding a stream of water to the Holy Blitzball Field in the Sky.<br><br>Further, because of the intense ammount of magic crystal required to move all of that stuff, what if a very small group of people populated the solid area around the volcano?  I mean, it puts them directly next to a water source, it's loaded with magic, and if someone fell off of a rock they could simply land there, instead.<br><br>Because of their exposure to the crystal, they would have a heightened resistance to magic attacks, because of the constant, close exposure.  But also because of the abundance of magic crystal, it becomes a basic skill.  I'd say about half of the population would have a skill level deemed "Intermediate to advanced" by the people living on the top-level of Aleta.  And because of their ability to harvest magic crystal, they've learned to forge and refine it into various things.  They've made magic weapons, clothing, accessories, but most importantly, they've discovered <b>vehicles</b>.  These vehicles have magic crystal placed at various joints on the body of it, with a central crystal on a pedastal at the front of the cart.  One simply has to push down on the crystal, and it connects the points of travel on the wheeled cart, and it moves at a consistent rate of its own desire.  The crystal then functions as sort of a joystick, completing various patterns as it glides to and from various circuits.  Because of this, they're allowed to turn, though not as swiftly as one might like.  (So if they got stuck, one might have to get out and put it back on the proper track.)  And to turn it off, they simply pull the crystal up, incompleting every triangular circuit.<br><br>Gods I talk a lot.<br><br>While the monks above are in charge of making sure that the Sin Sphere only pees on certain parts of their world, the monks below are making sure that it only drinks so much of its urine again.  The monks focus on purifying and more accurately directing the water.  Before it was just kinda dirty water flowing in a loose cycle, with precious bits floating into the Mist or out into space (assuming we have a space), but now it's pure and it flows in a perfect circle.  And based on this, the wizards/magicians/witches down there would have a stronger concept of water magic, though I wouldn't go so far as to call them Aquamancers or anything.  They just have more practice.<br><br>Settlements would be based around natural water springs, where there are leaks in the volcano and water wells up in natural recesses, and also around significant deposits of magic crystal.<br><br>But like all societies, there is that one area that you just don't want to be in.<br><br>It's the largest grouping of magic crystal down there, but it has warped the creatures and people that live near it.  The crystal there has actually saturated the air with magic crystal dust, and people are accidentally inhaling and injesting it whenever they get too close.  This allows them to be powerful bloodmages or whatever, but it also means they're BATSHITCOOCOOBANANAS CRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZY.  They would make Lady Gaga blend in with the furniture.  The monsters are no better.  They've even learned to harness blood magic and such, and can do some simple movement magic and such.  Our fears have been reached.  They know our secret.  The monsters learned magic.  What.<br><br>I would imagine the toplanders would want the srsbzns deposits of magic crystal.<br><br>THAT'S WHAT I GOT.  TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT.<br><br>(also choobbread this is really fun 5/5 to thumbs up A+ would buy again)<br><br>EDIT:  Gog damn I write a lot when I have ideas.<br><br>ALSO EDIT:  Hey.

Maybe just a prototype... hmm, suddenly I'm seeing animated magite walkers moving around volcanoland, which I'm now referring to as the Far Mass until someone has a better name.<br><br>And the "Orient" so far is the Isayoshindika Desert as well as the Telaenians. Apparently, Telaenians are both dark skinned and slanty eyed. And the Imikijini with their gunpowder and their herbal cures are pretty much oriental.<br><br>PS.

They have several pairs of legs, all of which attach to their "head" and completely encircle it. One group of legs drags the body across the ground while the rest are used to pummel it's prey to death.  It's vital organs are all carried and protected within it's abdomen. The abdomen itself is nearly impervious and can protect the organs even when it is pulled through lava/magma. It's legs are not as well built and can be crushed or cut off, though getting anywhere near them is a bad idea. <br><br>Currently their primary prey, mostly because there is nothing else there, are the swarms of Golaudrin, both the smaller ones and the massive Tolt. </div></div>

Sky's Reach sounds dope.<br><br><b>Asalim Peak / Sky's Watch</b><br>This one's better than Mount asia. Maybe make mountasia more like this one? I dunno.<br><br><b>Alurile</b><br>Man, I can pronounce jgélðhrn easier than that. Lorelei. Allure. I feel like there should be another consonant between the first L and the U. Alsurile. Alsurlie. I dunno.<br><br><b>Anerai</b><br>Santerai. (ololo sublime). Canerais. Anescera. I dunno.<br><br><b>Dark Fringe</b><br>We need a fancy name I guess since Sky's Reach and Sky's Dong both have a fancy name. Siestrus. Festrus. Festus. Festivus. Thesaurus. <br><br><b>Eliralu</b><br>Ee-lie-luh-roo? Ee-lee-rah-loo? It looks fine other than I'm confused on pronunciation. Still dig it.<br><br><b>Endless</b><br>I'm fine with keeping it this and not giving it a fancy name. Maybe tie it into the Dark Fringe if we do, though.<br><br><b>Far Mass</b><br>Where is this? Is that volcanoland? Flagostra. Conflest. Tiesto. Lupe Fiasco.<br><br><b>Free Territories</b><br>Lemmetia. Kimolet. Kamelot. Camelot. King Arthur. Lancelot. Lance Bass. Backstreet's back, alright. <br><br><b>Isayoshindika </b><br>Oh man, Biscuit, you should have stopped like eight syllables ago. I say oh shit, dick A! Oshindika. Ishondi. Sayoshdi. Sayoshin. Saosin. Emo. These Arms Are Snakes.<br><br><b>Paldeta</b><br>Either that or Paldetta. I don't know which pronunciation I prefer.<br><br><b>Ortigue</b><br>yes.<br><br><b>Ovora</b><br>Ovary. Ovoviviparous. Vulva. Beef curtains. Ovolska? I'm not against the name but all I think about when I see it is eggs and birds and omelettes.<br><br><b>Reaching Isles</b><br>Stretching Lanes. Grasping Corridor.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">I suppose I should at this point interject to log my idea since the topic is now winding down....<br><br>Everything has gone as planned....<br><br>Zenin Tharle, a race of shapeshifting dragons! *gasp*<br><br>I've already discussed this a bit with Choobeh so I'll just give the basic premis. These things cannot use magic, aside from their shapeshifting ability. And they're more like werepeople than shapeshifters. They have the ability to take on human form, and a stage halfway between human and their true form, mainly because they hunt and eat humans. <br><br>With magic users being a delicacy. <br><br>These things are basically nutter strong and tough in their true forms, along with being very intelligent, but tend to be loners outside of wartimes. During wartimes, however, they will ally themselves with humans to protect the overall stock...Cuz humans killin eachother is bad for their bellies in the long term.<br><br>Additionally, a couple mages/magic users/insanely tough people capable of attacking from range/are a pretty major issue to these dudes. Especially in human or half human form. They can't shapeshift out of human form while a person is looking at them, or at and point where they think a person might be looking at them. Its just part of their nature to maintain their cover, its instinctual, not a decision they get to make.<br><br>In their true form they do resemble dragons, so I guess we can call em dragons of a kind. They have four forelegs positioned more towards the front, and two hindlegs like a traditional dragon. They are skinny, leanly muscled for their size, ribcages are pretty visible. Spines go down the back and tail, with large forward curving horns on the front of the head. Their heads are long and triangular, and they have razor smiles with dozens or large, sharp teeth.<br><br>Their colouring tends more towards black with streaks of a dark colour, such as blue, red, or violet. They do have very large wings, and are more than capable of flight. They have no breath weapon, however, and rely purely on tooth, claw, and horn for damage in this shape. In human form they can be quite proficient with whatever weapon they chose, but are limited to little more than human physical value.<br><br>Zenin is the name of the species, Tharle is the name of the particular Zenin in this instance. It's used by humans believing this is the name of their species as a whole, since Tharle was the first to actually introduce himself. If more were to speak of their names, Zenin would prefix their name.<br><br>These guys are VERY uncommon and they are terratorial. I do intend to have one as a character, cuz I think it'll be fun as hell.</div></div>

There's this whole "thing" with Aleta where at least I've been trying to move away from Standard Fantasy Setting. I mean dragons are cool, yeah, but kind of overdone probably.<br><br>But I like the general idea of an intelligent super predator, even though basically everything is trying to kill humans in this world. I was going to say "but then again, most of those other creatures aren't just eating humans for the sake of eating" but then I remembered Grinleks, but then again, they aren't particularly picky on what they eat. i guess what differentiates the Zenin is that they try to blend in and kind of take the hunt to a form of art.<br><br>Ohhh I like that idea, too.

They are a type of shape shifter, yes. They are intelligent, multiformed, and view the hunt of sentient creatures as an art form. Hell, they even respect their prey over thinking them mindless cattle. I have a storyline in mind that I think would be really awesome. And quite honestly, this was more inspired by that huge black double forelimbed mother from Avatar.<br><br>Thing was scary, same idea here.<br><br>Not big huge magic using and village terrifying like dragons, smaller and more compact, a hunters form that picks out individuals. Sleek black skin, with touches of colour, not scales. Rows of fangs and teeth, a size relatively double that of a human when in its natural form. I don't want to expose my idea because I think its fun and a little twisted.<br><br>If you really want to veto this, my character will likely be completely unique, mayhaps one of a kind instead of an established species.

That barely passes in either directions due to vagueness, which is why we've got people on both sides of the fence, but my other personal rule is if you're stuck arguing "NO IT'S NOT LIKE THIS BECAUSE __________" then you've lost the battle because you're arguing details rather than overall concepts.<br><br>You have to boil it down to a pitch sentence, and that single sentence will determine if anyone even listens to you.

Their preferred meal are humans, and they hunt by taking human form to stalk their prey, and they generally feed once or twice a month. They are solitary creatures, and their overall numbers are low. On a base, instinctual level, they cannot shapeshift in front of anything or anyone that can retell the tale, because they try to keep their identities hidden. Their human form is fixed; if they are ever identified, they cannot change their features around to elude detection.<br><br>In their original form, they resemble skeletal wolves with thick, smooth skin. They are between half and 3/4 as tall as an elephant. They have six legs; the first set have opposable thumbs and dexterity approaching a primate's, the second set are only able to grasp, and the hind legs are just legs. They have wings, which wouldn't be able to lift them if not for the hydrogen sacs in their bodies. These sacs fill with hydrogen as part of some metabolic process, so the Zenin can be combusted fairly easily if pierced with something on fire (magic and hot arrows come to mind). A row of spikes go down their spines and along their long tails that counterbalance their weight in flight. Their teeth are silly amounts of sharp.<br><br>To shapeshift into a human, they condense all their mass into the form, though the hydrogen keeps them from falling through every floor ever. Because of this denseness, their skin is more resilient to piercing, though by no means impervious. Due to the magic that allows them to do shifting, spells they try to cast themselves in any form are destabilized and do not work. One way to tell if a person is actually a Zenin is to make physical contact on them and perform a spell. If it works, they are a person, if not, the spell fizzles out.<br><br>The creatures are long lived and breed a handful of times. Eggs are left in the Isayoshindika desert, and they hatch when various geological factors are met that signal an increased human population. Upon hatching, the young have an instinctive migratory pattern to secret areas in the Aequian mountain ranges where the oldest Zenin teach the surviving young the art of the hunt.<br><br>Mature zenin tend to gravitate towards populated cities where they can better get lost in the crowds and feed on a regular basis. A large city with a population of 4,000,000 will have between 10 and 30 Zenin hunting in it. The Zenin may meet each other, but they prefer to stay alone and will probably only arrange "hunting grounds" with the other. <br><br>A fight between a tower golem and full-beast zenin would be a close match. Someone will be getting wrecked, though.<br><br>Okay I lied this wasn't really a gist.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Additionally I feel I NEED to point out that if your character knows that Zenin can be detected by touching them and casting magic, then congradulations, you character is an extremely powerful high level mage who actually managed to survive the encounter.<br><br>Any Zenin realizing himself thus detected would then stab said mage. And then kill everyone/thing else in the room.<br><br>Choobeh and I have been sort of discussing incorporating Tyr into the overall world of Aleta. There are a few ways of doing this, though my preferred method nessisitates that I pose it to all of you as well.<br><br>Basically what I'd like to do, is take the three continents that make up Tyr, and turn them into a disk. Sort of like jupiters rings. The central portion between topmass and bottom mass would still exist with the asteroids as a part of it. The ocean that surrounded it would be constantly trying to throw itself into space, with gravity counteracting it, so there'd be a sort of vortexy funnel that'd retain the center asteroidial region.<br><br><img style="max-width: 100%;" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v335/FlamingSorrow/Aletyr.jpg"><br><br>Tyr would basically become the Coremass of the overall world. Allowing all of us that were actually IN Tyr to keep our nifty characters. You could also make the argument that Magite and the Corallian Ether Crystals are basically one and the same, which ties the magical systems of Aleta and Tyr together, though Tyr hasn't discovered how to use magic without focuses. They have to use ancient ether tech as a focus.<br><br>Just though I'd throw it out there, since Tyr doesn't have much chance otherwise. There's little point in arguing it with Lee anymore, he just tells me to post it in general rp, even though there was interest before and could easily be again. *shrug* It is his call though. Feel free to express your thoughts or go look up old Tyr info, I know its still kicking around. I'd also direct you to my short story about Sero in the fic section, which I may continue if Tyr does come into this.</div></div>

So, the Ortiques are screwed, Talitians are screwed, Telaens are screwed, Ovorans are screwed... I'd say that pretty much everyone is screwed except for whatever we have on the fire side of Aleta and Kvidera (though they'll probably get transplanted there)<br><br><br>Now I have no problem with Prime joining World Building and proposing stuff, and I'll listen to his ideas and see how good they are and I might personally approve some and even say so, but, like Lee said, this is basically where all the hard work we've put in amounts to almost nothing. </div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Hex</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">You're overreacting mate. I don't want that information flung about because ever character when then be innately assumed to know it, and will magically check only the characters that actually are Zenin. The Zenin are not an uber race, as Choobeh has already pointed out. In fact, they have fatal weaknesses and flaws in their very nature.<br><br>If you shoot them with a flaming arrow, they die. Explosively in fact. Painful. If they come within six inches of a magical object, its stops working, exposing their presence, assuming the person can interpret the fault. If we make all of this information common knowledge, then the Zenin are an endangered species from the get go.<br><br>So, here for instance. You have a city with a population of 4 million. If you know much about Zenin, and can do math, then you realize that about 200,000 easily has the birth potential to feed a single Zenin without overculling the population. They want humans to grow in number, not lessen, because then the food is more bountiful. <br><br>In an area of 4 million people, you now know there are roughly 20 Zenin about. Knowing that they explode when punctured with flaming arrows or fireballs, you know how to defeat them. Ordinary soldiers or police with bows and ichor tipped arrows would be an effective extermination squad. And to detect them, you merely set up a great many cheque points, making it difficult for them to move around.<br><br>If someone runs, you know they're either a criminal, or a Zenin that knows he's about the be tested. And the method of testing would basically be a flashlight. If the magical light from the 'torch' goes out, here stands a Zenin. Que flaming arrows. And due to their instinctual inability to shapeshift in front of humans who can witness it, they'd be easy targets to armed troopers or police. Even in human form, if struck with an arrow, they'd still combust explosively.<br><br>So yes, they are powerful fighters in short spurts at close range. And they can fly. They hunt and eat humans, and even adopt and even improve pieces of their culture, perhaps even work with their military strategy. They have an overall mindset that attempts to foster humanity, making their civilization stronger and wealthier so their bounty is more plentiful.<br><br>So sorry, blood, but these are not uber creatures from the eighth circle of hell. You just don't trust <i>me</i> specifically with them. Which has been the overwhelming response from pretty much everyone. The idea stands as it is, and you're welcome to use and even benefit from it. I, however, am apparently unwelcome to use the idea's in my own head.<br><br>So yeah, I exaggerated my description. The actual event in the situation where they were prepared for it and knowing what the magics failure meant would likely me an almost certain death for any Zenin. I would just like to emphasis the fact that a Zenin would be very, very concerned, with making sure any human who aquired this knowledge, didn't live long enough to pass it on.<br><br>And thus, if you want to assume a high level mage has survived an encounter with a Zenin to pass on this information on a widespread scale and turn them into an endangered species, you're welcome to.<br><br>But don't pretend it doesn't make you a dick.<br><br>*sigh*<br><br>So can I use my own damn idea? Its not like I couldn't go overboard and create a broken human character, so why is so called 'uber creature' off the menu? Prime is an excellent example, he used to be so powerful he could scoff at a God without fearing the response, because the God couldn't be certain he was powerful enough to enforce punishment.<br><br>I've been trying rather hard to rein in on my Gurren Lagaan like tendencies over doing overpowered out of the plot things. And from what I understand you, and almost everyone else, feel that I've made progress that measures in nanoincriments. Thanks, your confidence is inspiring and has done a lot to hurt my feelings from the hatching of this idea to its fleshing out.<br><br>You're confidence is me has proven to be so low, that I almost don't want to participate at all. I don't get anything out of it, my only response is overwhelming negativity even in the face of a perfectly acceptable idea. I'm not writing purely as a selfish desire, I like the interaction, I like your reactions and your characters reactions. But if I'm not having any positive impact, should I be here anymore? Like, really, should I be here anymore?<br><br>I'm not going to be depressed or emo based on your response, its a reality. What is is, but if there's no point to my actions here...then my actions are hollow. Feels sort of pointless, don't you think?<br><br>And hell, it hurts most of all that you'd be the one to openly say that Blood. You're the one I came back here for, at your persistent request. Way to knife me buddy.<br><br>Note: Assuming Aleta has 1 billion inhabitants, that would account for 5000 plus or minus one hundred or see, Zenin. Oh yeah, their an uber race alright. I wonder how long it would take to kill all the asians on the planet if everyone were dedicated to it. Ooor, the spanish, or black people. Or hell, lets go with a tiny minority like redheads! What do you think? A month? A year? Not that long I'd think...and even those minorities outnumber the Zenin.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">The Evil Biscuit</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Yeah, I really didn't have a problem with them once I knew they were few and far between. They have a very boogeyman, urban legend sort of vibe to them, which I LOVE - especially when I combine it with the tribal cultures of the Imikijini. Mothers telling their children that Zeni al-Tak will come in the night and devour them for misbehaving, or whole tribes being plagued by a pair of Zenin, a la Ghost and the Darkness. It's a very cool idea when you look at it that way, and I'd like to throw that concept in Prime's arena for him to use. <br><br>If they were their own race, had a substantial population, and were large enough to exert an influence over the world, then I'd have to say no. But since they're not, I don't find any issue with letting Prime run around eating people. He's not going to eat them <i>all</i>. <br><br>Besides, guys, we need enemies OTHER than the jigglyduffs. </div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">ch00beh</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Ok. I'm jumping in Prime's defense, considering that you guys are also doubting the fact that he worked on this shit with me. I have the overall balance of the world in mind, kids, don't worry your little heads. A golem can take a beast form Zenin, a tower golem can beat the snot out of an unarmored Zenin, and squad of Shields could probably give him one hell of a fight considering they're trained monster-slayers. A single Shield could take on a human-form Zenin. The king badass may be the jigglypuffs, but you gotta remember, Shields are super soldiers who don't see anything wrong with fucking themselves up or throwing laws to the wind to get the upper hand (tattooed buffs, blood magic, chemistry). <br><br>Then there are numbers to take into account. As Biscuit gathered, they're on boogeyman levels of scarcity. Archivists know they exist. They're rarer than Powers in ORP.<br><br>Local police, I don't see them specializing in catching Zenin.<br><br>The shapeshifting is so that he can look human during an RP, otherwise he'll just be killing everything instead of actually interacting, which is about 10x worse.<br><br>I don't see what's wrong with too many shapeshifters, anyway, considering that my race of the Reaching Isles have two forms they shift between (a unique looking person and a shark/dolphin/octopus), and the Zenin have two forms they shift between (a unique looking person and a beast). The Dranids, from what I remember, do whatever shape they want because they have no original shape, right? So they're the uber shapeshifting race, from my perspective.<br><br>Also, the half-foot anti-magic field snuffs out magical tech, which is pretty prevalent in Aleta. I'm going to hand-wave and say if a mage is casting anything in touch range, or has any buffs, they won't just fizzle out. They'll just sense something is wrong or something. Though sustained magic tech not cast from a person will go out. (lights, flowing water, etc)<br><br>In other news, I think I like the boogeymen idea more than the idea of a handful of zenin working openly with the Shields that Prime and I discussed but never finalized. (it was to make the Shields more assholish for letting the zenin raid a town as a reward for beating back a Fall since otherwise, a Zenin can survive off cows and goats, he just won't be happy about it)<br><br>A note on diversity in creatures: I assumed it was implied that any creature on Earth exists on Aleta, as well, given the proper biome. We don't need redundant creatures because we're just copy-pasting a working ecosystem. This thread is about defining the fantastical creatures.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Ok, in other news, I've talked to Prime about the anti-magic field. We've settled that the easiest definition for magic and zenin is that in general, magic will work on them unless they've got you grappled, in which case it fizzles. Slapping them in the face with a hand made of fire is fair game, but if they've got you in a choke hold, it won't work.

        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Idea for a zenin: It diguised itself as a chef, consciously making its meals as delicious and fattening as possible. It then eats the regulars from its restaraunt, making sure a criminal group meets in the establishment to give an "excuse" for other regulars to vanish. (Bonus points for a showy style of cooking where he risks burning himself constantly, his way of getting "risk", since he's hunting essentially fattened calves for food.)<br><br>Of course, that one isn't so much Prime's style. That's more myself, Photu, Ninety, or Biscuit there.<br><br>I like Prime's angle of them pushing for humans to be successful. They want food, so I'd actually like to see one as a politician, mandating a certain birthrate for couples, having a rabid expansionist view, and making dangerous deals with the Ortigians to get a boosted harvest, encouraging an even larger population.<br><br>All in all, with the idea refined, it's good stuff. It gives us something for the setting that ISN'T Shield/Jiggyhorns, allowing a new angle for a lot of characters. Right now, the big things for Aleta are:<br>-Shields/Jugheads<br>-Zenin<br>-Telaens (Not much shown of them yet, but they're the most easily recognizable facet of Aleta thusfar, IMO, and a lot of plans mention them.)<br>-Ortigians (Yet again, not much motion yet. But they'd make a great evil empire. Somebody mind digging up my old plan involving infiltrating their nation or whatever?)<br><br>The Reaching Islands and most of Blood's angle still need some toying with to make them seem an involved part of the setting, IMO. As is, they just feel like outliers. Of course, a bit of tweaking to make it seem like a forboding "Fringe", and we'd be onto something.<br><br>Also, is there anything for the UNDERSIDE of Aleta? I might throw together an idea for that if there isn't.</div></div>

I know there are two factions down there, at least, one who likes nature stuff, and one who uses a different kind of magitek type thing. Overworld booze transports use the underside for movement to avoid authorities.<br><br>I'd toss Pelantesque up there in the major things for Aleta. They don't really have much to do with the jigglypuffs and the shields. Bootleggers/authorities for a minorer conflict.<br><br>Prime pitched the politician idea at me as well, but my main problem with it is that people will be suspicious of that politician that likes to take a stroll on the nights that someone disappears. Also he's kind of been in office forever. I mean yeah, it'd be pretty easy to fake your death every couple decades (get abducted by horndogs, transform into beast mode, kill, hide, come back), but still. <br><br>Also, I think we should examine Tyr before ironing out the other islands. Normally, I'd iron out a detail before adding more, but Prime and I discussed that it would probably be a good idea for the sake of Tyr to combine the worlds. I don't remember anything about this world besides basic firearms, magic, and swords, but apparently there is some futuristic magitek lying around in ruins. Not sure how best to amalgamate, yet, but I think we need the full brief on "what is Tyr."<br><br>Prime seems pretty intent on keeping the three island structure of the world, but I'm thinking that geography can be massively retooled so long as we keep the general spirit of the world. I think across the ocean would work for location, and just assume that the current map of Aleta is not the fully explored version. But the problem there would be isolation and lack of interaction.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">The main differences are those from Tyr require an ether focus to cast 'magic' as it were, and the transportation. Tyr has a coastal race that tends to be very very good at building and crewing ships. They also had a very loose and open culture. They were also modeled by myself and Bulbs, and took somewhat after Andalites. They were humanoid, but I believe they retained the tail. In any case, they, plus the ancient transport tech. IE Broken old ships, hovercraft, or vehicle classified as 'other', could be used to ferry people across the oceans. Or ocean in this case.<br><br>There were a couple other races, I'll boil down the descriptions.<br><br>The aformentioned coastal race, I don't recall their names atm but I'll look it up. Or bulbs will know.<br><br>Corallians, who are basically humans but have evolved a naturally forming Ether crystal that allows them to weakly, but innately, control magic. I believe they can be easily used to tie into Aleta, as Aletains would recognize the crystal as Magite. Easy neat little tie in no?<br><br>There were ordinary humans no different than us I believe. Anyone wishing to reference that should direct their attention to the Sero Shortstory in the fic section.<br><br>There was another race, once more the name escapes me, but I believe it started with a G...In any case they tended to be referred to by tribe, and there are around 6 to 8 tribes, all rather large. They were around 8 feet tall, with tails that ranged from a stubby 4 feet to a long 10 feet. Ape like, they're humanoid, but covered mostly with furr save for the exception of their chest and faces. (So, sort of the opposite of where we have hair.) They tended to simply wear loincloths for clothing.<br><br>They were also more heavily muscled, and their culture tended to focus on more warlike capacities as well as crafting. So, they make excellent smiths, or construction workers, ect.<br><br>The main mode of magic was the aformentioned ether, though in most cases it is with a found or appropriated ether artifact build by ancient technology. (Only the very lucky or very crafty get their hands on one.) And the main method was basically will and intent. So Tyr, as compared to Aleta, has a much heavier focus on what Choobeh refers to as advanced magic, but it presents in a much rarer percentage of the populace due to the rarity of the objects which produce it.<br><br>I'd assume Magite presents in Tyr, but unlike Aleta, it has no naturally burrowing holes to the underside that shows them the value of deep mining or such things. Or I'd suggest that Magite is only or prominantly found on the Underside stead of on the main top mass. A reason for it being so expensive in Choobehs mind.<br><br>...<br><br>My fingers are tired so I'm done now I guess.<br><br>EDIT - Side note to Choobeh, name me a night that someone in a city of 20,000 to 300,000 doesn't disappear? Or an even larger city? Most of the time people would write it off as a party, or drinking passed out someone, or not be concerned because its the person's nature.... No, I don't think anyone a politician Zenin, as long as he didn't eat his friggin opponents.</div></div>

Larger, overground veins are found surrounded by oases in the desert, and Telaen have a natural wander near them during their migrations. Tinier veins are found under the mountains.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Each one is probably actually about 3/4ths the size of Aleta, but one of the major defining features was the huge bridges between each continent, which would probably need to be dropped. I don't mind reworking the races from a cultural standpoint, but their appearances and abilities slot into Aleta pretty well. One race is blue, averages four feet with a bipedal structure and andalite like tails, prefer coastal regions, and consider tops optional in cities and on ships due to their intense naval obsessions. Women included.<br><br>Another is basically a human with a more developed frame and size, evolving in a different direction than Corallians, who focused on mental growth instead of physical growth. And with that the Corallians developed a slightly higher average  intellect and innate magite.<br><br><s>Also only a very young Zenin would make that sort of mistake, their low population nessesitates an overall higher level of intellect. Lack of experience would be the deciding factor in that situation. However replace the 'is an ace detective' with 'becomes an ace detective' and I'm friction issued free.</s><br><br>Choobeh and I had a chat, and yeah, a mistake like that could be made and recovered from as he's pointed out, so I have no objection. However I still think a more experienced Zenin, we he to live so long, would be less likely to make that sort of mistake.</div></div>

But that's okay because the fortress can replace them with another person. Also they still do try to patch up any wounds.<br>-Highly defensive against outsiders (since everything can kill them or steal their babies or loot), but they value trade, no that's allowed in the not-deep-inside areas. <br>-They march to battle/do their jobs even if they are carrying their babies.<br>-They regularly eat kittens and puppies (among other animals), including the organs, and then turn the leftover bone into crafts or cheap weapons or decorations.<br>-Pretty skilled with mechanical stuff such as gear work driven by waterwheels or windmills.<br>-Can see in the dark.<br><br>On some level, they're reminding me of Blood's defensive tower guys.

Terraces are built along the slopes of Telaen backs to support rice paddies, with carp and ducks used as pest control during non-planting time. Fruit orchards on the top portion double as bird/bat traps. All agriculture is boosted by magic. Hunting parties are used for more meat. Housing and food storage is also built cantilevered off the sides to maximize farmland. In addition to all this, there is a mercenary culture with Telaenians going off to bring supplemental income to their homes as metal and salt are needed but can only be gotten through trade. Given a Telaen the size of 5-10 football fields, you can probably get a static population of 100-150 Telaenians with that, plus another 50-100 or so flux mercenaries.<br>- Magic got a lot more limited. Something cannot be created out of nothing (as such Honetai human forms are now 6 footers and their shark forms are smaller than average), and some semblance of conservation of energy is required. Written arrays either consume themselves after use or draw power from a bound source like a fire pit or your body heat.</div></div>
