Therefore, only that person and myself should be posting here until I invite someone else.<br><br>The following takes place shortly before the events in Summoner Style in which Hector receives a letter from the Raiixian royal family. Consider this a sort of prologue to the upcoming Raiixia arc.</i></div><br><br><i>Amsterdam, The Netherlands, 1:00 PM</i><br><br>Today was a quiet, tranquil day at Der Rustig Zwaan. The few customers there chatted amongst themselves quietly and sipped their coffee. Two women, seated at a circular table overlooking the canal, browsed through menus with eyes hidden behind chic sunglasses with rose frames. At the center of the table was a napkin holder shaped like a swan, and a black lacy parasol which kept the sun's rays at bay. A classy, upscale place, perfect to hold quite an august luncheon.<br><br>"How did you find out about this woman anyway, Marimai?" one of the ladies murmured, in an exotic language. A straw sunhat adorned with false lilacs was perched atop her head, and her red-orange hair was styled into a neat bob. Her manicured nail traced through the appetizers section, tapping against an item occasionally as she considered the choices carefully.<br><br>"I've... heard stories about her. People say her expertise is information." Marimai Nyktori, seated opposite the other woman, pretended to peruse the menu, even though she knew she would not be staying around for the luncheon. Her long, wavy brown hair was partly tied up in a bun. Women seated near her glanced over to admire her beautiful cream Chanel dress and her black designer heels. "Make sure you do not reveal too much information, Kaina'mei. We have to make sure we can trust her first."<br><br>Kaina'mei nodded. "I understand." A waiter approached the table, inquiring them as to what their appetizer would be. "<i>Humus met brood, alstublieft.</i>" She set down the menu and removed her sunglasses, staring at Marimai with concern in her scarlet eyes. When the waiter left and she was absolutely sure no one was listening, she leaned in close and whispered, "Are you absolutely sure no one knows you are here?"<br><br>"I took extreme measures to assure that my whereabouts are currently unknown. Although, the rebels are too busy dealing with Raiixian dissenters to bother with going after us. For now, at least." Marimai handed a black clutch purse to Kaina'mei. "There should be enough Euros in there to pay for lunch and anything else you may need, as well as the photos. I have to leave now. <i>Veel geluk</i>, Annelies van Meegeren."<br><br>"And good luck to you too, my queen. Ryora protect you." The two women rose to their feet to embrace briefly and exchange kisses on the cheek. Marimai exited the cafe, and Kaina'mei returned to her seat to wait patiently for her contact to arrive.<br><br><br><br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler7999970').toggle();if($('#spoiler7999970').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler7999970">OOC: Ohay, by the way, the invitation was sent under that false name right there.

        <h2 class="poster">Beelzebibble</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">The lowest folds of her indigo dress swayed gently around her aged ankles as Yoon Mangjeol strolled down the brick street. It was one of her plainest and therefore least favored articles of clothing, but she was no longer in the Archipelago, where an eye untrained to discern Koreans from off-Japanese might easily take her for a descendant of the native fishing villagers. Lacking this means to blend in, Yoon had opted to dress simply. It was a shame, though, really, that her features set her apart here. She hadn't spent twenty-four hours in this city and yet she already felt more kinship with its people than with those back home. For the citizens of Amsterdam epitomized the consummately European notion, which Yoon embraced with all her being, that to rise before ten o'clock in the morning was the act of a masochist.<br><br>When she reached the canal, she lingered for a moment against the stone railing to adjust her cloche hat. There must have been some kind of event underway, as it was hard otherwise to explain how so many boats would have gathered on the surface at one time. Their occupants were shouting at each other and laughing. A boom box on one of the decks blasted a deplorably bass-heavy number. The rippling water reflected a dozen colorful hulls or more.<br><br>"How aren't they <i>sinkin'</i>, I want to know," the fellow beside Yoon said.<br><br>He was a young, skinny black man sporting a modest afro and dressed in a brown t-shirt, baggy beige shorts and caramel-colored sandals. Perhaps in recognition of the fact that his sunglasses made it difficult for him to point anything out with his gaze, he directed a couple of slender fingers toward several tiny canoes managing to support five or six people each. <br><br>"Hey, in America, you couldn't squeeze <i>two</i> fat asses into a boat that size," he observed.<br><br>"It's very impressive," she said. She pulled out and unfolded the street map from her purse with an idle finger. A dashed line zigzagged to this point from the hotel. From here a dotted line led along the canal several blocks to the cafe. The man leaned over and took a look at the map, puffing his cigarette.<br><br>"Good. Almost there."<br><br>"Yes, we won't be too late after all," replied Yoon. She refolded the map and tucked it back into her purse. Then she turned to look at him. She hesitated for a moment before adding, "If you don't mind terribly, Mr. Mayordomo... As long as we're here, would you agree to walking a small distance apart from me?"<br><br>The man's eyebrows lowered. "Hey," he said, "can't let you go far, Miz Mangjeol."<br><br>"Oh, of course, I understand, but within reason..." She waved her hand inarticulately. Mr. Mayordomo apparently misconstrued it as a literal gesture of fanning.<br><br>"Hey! I don't got to smoke right now." He plucked the cigarette from his lips and held it over the railing. Yoon shook her head quickly enough to give him pause.<br><br>"It's not that," she murmured, "it's..."<br><br>"What?" Mr. Mayordomo looked around, most likely noticed a passing white couple glancing at them, and drew his head back. "Oh, hey, I get it. Ain't <i>cul</i>tural."<br><br>"No no no, Mr. Mayordomo, please..." Yoon's eyes fell. She clutched her purse strap with both hands. "As long as we're speaking plainly, I'm afraid that if anything it's the <i>age</i>," she whispered.<br><br>The young man scratched his nose for a moment before nodding. "That's fair," he said. "I accept that. That is fair. Though, hey, lemme tell you, Miz Mangjeol, there's a lot of guys my age would <i>leap</i> at the prospect of takin' you out on the town." He grinned and pressed the cigarette back to his mouth.<br><br>"I'm perfectly flattered, Mr. Mayordomo, really."<br><br>Yoon stepped away from the railing and walked alongside the canal, leaving behind the auditory abomination but not Mr. Mayordomo, who gave her perhaps twenty feet before following behind, still bearing that contented smile. It was enough. She acknowledged that the other plane ticket she had received in the mail could have ended up in the hands of a much less pleasant travelling companion, but Mr. Mayordomo's frequent and unrefined commentary irked her. She needed space. Although she was honestly a touch surprised he had consented to her request; even given the circumstances, she had at least half expected him to refuse outright.<br><br>Ah, there it was. Der Rustig Zwaan. Yoon looked over the handful of customers, decided she couldn't reasonably extract Annelies van Meegeren from among them on sight, and took a table of her own. A waitress appeared, correctly identified Yoon as a visitor to the country, and addressed her in English, but Yoon demurred with the claim that she was there to meet someone. She looked back. Mr. Mayordomo had settled against the railing across from the cafe. Though he was facing her, she could not tell where his eyes were oriented. He continued to smile nonchalantly. <br><br>There was obviously no need to unfold the map at this moment, but if she had, Yoon would have noticed that the entire route from the hotel to the cafe was now marked by one uninterrupted dashed line.<br><br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler2666890').toggle();if($('#spoiler2666890').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler2666890"><i>OOC: Was NOT expecting to debut this character in this topic! I surprise myself constantly. There is actually a reason for his presence, which has nothing to do with Loogs' story so I hope she doesn't mind him tagging along with Yoon.</i></div></div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Loogs</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Kaina'mei was busying herself with her compact, checking to make sure her eyelashes were curled just right and that her coral lipstick wasn't smeared, when she noticed an elderly Korean woman in an indigo dress out of the corner of her eye. She stowed away her compact and approached the woman with her most professional face she could present. "Excuse me, but would you happen to be Ms. Mangjeol?" Her loose, billowy lavender dress fluttered around in the slight breeze. "I am Annelies van Meergeren. I apologize if you could not find me, but the current circumstances did not allow me to enclose photos, and we are trying to be very cautious. Come to my table, please, the appetizer should be ready for us very soon."<br><br>Indeed, for just as the two ladies moved over to Kaina'mei's table, the waiter arrived and placed a warm, oval-shaped basket of freshly-baked pita bread and a porcelain bowl filled with hummus on the table gingerly. Kaina'mei plucked a piece out of the basket and scooped some of the creamy dip with it.<br><br>"My sources tell me that you are exceptionally knowledgeable. Tell me, how skilled are you at, say... obtaining information from people?" She nibbled politely at the piece of pita in her hand, keeping a straight poker face throughout. Kaina'mei took into very careful consideration the possibility of Yoon extracting from her confidential information concerning the current movements of the Raiixian royal family. It was with the weight of Marimai's steadfast trust on her shoulders that she earnestly entreated Yoon to partake in some of the bread.<br><br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler2742262').toggle();if($('#spoiler2742262').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler2742262">Hello, my name is Stephanie and I clearly have no first-hand knowledge of either restaurant dining or Amsterdam. Also formal meetings, that too.</div></div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Beelzebibble</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Oh, no thank you, really, I just had a continental brunch at the hotel and I'm afraid one may have indulged oneself a bit." Yoon leaned back in her curlicued iron chair. "In my defense, I hadn't expected the fare to be that good. Really the entire hotel was a marvelous find -- excellent quality for such a reasonable price -- though I <i>would</i> register the usual complaint about showers. Do you ever suppose sometimes that they've screwed on all the hot and cold taps wrong? Is the hotel shower industry one of those which institutionalize passive aggression, I wonder."<br><br>She looked out toward the canal. Mr. Mayordomo had struck up a conversation with another dark-skinned man in passing. "On a watery note," she added to Ms. van Meegeren (how many surnames in the vicinity began with the letter M!), "I noticed quite a large gathering of boats in the canal on my way here. One admits one's curiosity was piqued. Is there perhaps some kind of event underway?"<br></div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Loogs</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Hmm. Strange. You say you found the hotel yourself? I thought I had a room ready for you already. I can sympathize with your complaints about the shower. Sometimes you're lucky if you even get hot water. And let's not even begin to discuss the dismal water pressure in some of those places." Kaina'mei started on another piece of pita and frowned. If Yoon wasn't going to eat any of the bread, and she wasn't going to fill up on it, then some of it was going to go to waste, and as an exceptionally skilled cook Kaina'mei shuddered at the thought of wasting perfectly good food. "As for all the boats..." Kaina'mei looked towards the canal behind them and trailed off, ransacking her memory for any mention of an event she may have overheard. As she did, she glimpsed an oncoming fleet of boats, each carrying well-oiled, muscular men wearing nothing but speedos and boas of various dazzling colors. Techno music blared out of a boom box as they gyrated erotically against each other to the beat.<br><br>"Oh, that's right, I HAD heard something about a gay pride event going on. They're parading in boats down the canals." Kaina'mei raised her eyebrows in fascination. The flamboyancy of these pride parades reminded her of extravagant Raiixian festivals back home, bonfires burning brilliantly and the people dressed up in the brightest clothes and accessories they could fashion. She thought of her younger days when she would dance in the streets, draped in golden necklaces and bangles, barely dressed in petite orange panties and an orange bra embroidered in red. Elaborate headpieces and a tail-like piece attached to the panties were fashioned of real phoenix feathers. Oh, the wild, exhilarating experience of it all!<br><br>Suddenly, she remembered her task and was dragged back into the present. Turning back to face Yoon, she opened the menu again. "I will go ahead and order lunch now. Perhaps you might like to order for yourself something light, or perhaps some coffee or tea?" When the waiter approached the table, she ordered couscous and rooibos tea and a slice of cheesecake for dessert. Kaina'mei handed back the menu and waited again for the waiter to leave before asking her next question.<br><br>"Now, I'm sure you have heard about the coup d'etat in Raiixia that occurred recently? It has already started to make the news."</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Beelzebibble</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Did I? Now, Ms. van Meegeren, I'm about to embarrass myself quite beyond recovery." Yoon Mangjeol raised a delicate hand to her faintly wrinkled cheek, partly out of consternation and also at least slightly out of a half-suppressed urge to plug her ears. If anything offended her even more than the primitive melody pounding in from the canal, it was the mechanical, unyielding rhythm. Did the composers not understand the beauty of silence? What need was there to create such dense sound? Yet she smiled and gave no indication of her discomfort but to raise her voice very slightly. <br><br>"I have no head for the names favored in that part of the world... But I <i>did</i> hear the name of the insurgents' leader... F... Oh dear. It started with an F. It sounded a bit like 'Five Girl Backhand'. Although doesn't that sound more like a tennis style? Or a term for an especially wide-ranged and misogynistic kind of slap?" Yoon indulged her ongoing dire habit of tittering at her own comments.<br><br>"Well, I know that he's driven the royal family out of the country and that his people have assumed control... Now let me see. I <i>do</i> remember their name, if you'll just -- The Altarics, that's it. The Altaric Raiixians. Isn't that so?"</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Loogs</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"That is correct, Ms. Mangjeol." Kaina'mei pried open the clutch Marimai had given her and passed a photo over to Yoon. In the glossy portrait a man with scruffy, long hair the color of burnt sienna, and reddish-brown skin, with immense crimson wings extended behind him. His chiseled face was serious and austere and his dark brown eyes were piercing, penetrating, the look of someone determined and driven. "The leader of the coup is one Mr. Fahyrv Gharlyul Bakhann. Raiixia has had problems with him in the past. He is under considerable suspicion of being behind terrorist attacks in the area, and so he was exiled. However, the Altaric Raiixian populations has protested against this. Apparently he's some sort of national hero to them." Kaina'mei gazed somberly at the photo for a minute. She recalled that day, a day in which many people close and dear to her perished after a popular mall in the capital city exploded.<br><br>Before she asked the next important question, Kaina'mei made sure to stare Yoon square in the eyes, locking her down with her stare. "Of course by now you must be wondering the reason why I have called you here. Someone of great power and influence requested that I summon you here and discuss with you the opportunity to hire you as a spy to obtain vital information from the Altaric Raiixian rebels. You would of course be paid handsomely." She moistened her dry, chapped lips nervously. If she and Marimai could not trust this woman, then they could be in grave danger. Kaina'mei muttered a small prayer in her head.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Beelzebibble</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Yoon's smile made several attempts, though she roundly stifled them, to be different facial expressions. But with her concentration upon the muscles of her cheeks and jaw, she managed to inadvertently shake her head slightly. "You -- Excuse me?" she asked. "I don't..."<br><br>"Hey, Miz Mangjeol," said a voice, and she started in her seat. <br><br>It was Mr. Mayordomo, of course, although why he had seen fit to drift so close to their table was a point of some curiosity. "Can I borrow you for a second? You mind?"<br><br>She glared at him for a beat until she realized that his surpassingly rude intrusion upon their conversation was in fact a useful way to put off answering Ms. van Meegeren. "Please excuse us for a moment," she beamed at the latter. "And forgive my companion's rudeness." She stood up from the table. Mr. Mayordomo set off toward the railing overlooking the canal, but Yoon rounded and entered the cafe instead. She needed a glass wall in between herself and that dreadful music. He followed her in, dropping his cigarette into an ashtray near the door. She laid her purse on a stool and stared at him. "What is it," she asked.<br><br>"Well, I couldn't help overhearin' the business end of your chat there, and I thought, hey, maybe you could use a little timeout, talk to the boss about this, see what he says."<br><br>"Ah really?" said Yoon. "And did it occur to you that I might reject the offer? In which case there might, in fact, be no need to inform your employer that it had even been posed?"<br><br>Mr. Mayordomo's forehead wrinkled over the rims of his sunglasses. "Hey, what? <i>Reject</i> it? She said you'd be paid handsomely, didn't she? C'mon, how hard is it, you sneakin' around, pickin' up info? That's what you do!"<br><br>"Me? Oh no no. You may have been misinformed. I sit at a table and buy and sell facts and rumors. I do <i>not</i> 'sneak around' on politically unstable territory, gathering knowledge to assist the exiled enemies of the current rulers. Who, and I'll allow you this ignorance Mr. Mayordomo because you did not see the photograph, happen to be <i>seven-foot-tall birdmen</i>," Yoon hissed. If a passing waiter had been about to ask whether they needed any assistance, he evidently changed his mind. "And take those sunglasses off when we're indoors, I can't talk to you like that."<br><br>"Hey, okay, okay." Mr. Mayordomo pulled off the sunglasses, revealing large dark eyes. "Not tryin' to make you mad, Miz Mangjeol. It's just I <i>might</i> have texted the boss, let him know you were pitched some kind of deal and some big money could get stirred up. I -- Hey! C'mon! What?" Because she had opened her purse and was slapping him with the folded-up map at her fingertips.<br><br>"What were you <i>thinking?</i>" she demanded.<br><br>"Just -- Christ! -- just keepin' everyone on the same page, Miz Mangjeol!" he protested. "Thought he'd probably give me a call, so I wanted to offer you the chance to... hey, speak of..." For Mr. Mayordomo's cell phone was ringing. He pulled it out, looked at it and held it forward. "See there you go, what'd I say. So, hey, you want to talk to him, or--?"<br><br>Shortly: "I do not."<br><br>Mr. Mayordomo retracted the still-ringing cell phone without yet answering it. His expression was concerned. He posited a question which seemed somewhat warped given the circumstances. "Do you hate me, Miz Mangjeol? Please don't... I'm just tryin' to facilitate things over here. I didn't know you weren't up for the job."<br><br>Yoon sighed. "Just tell him to forget you said anything, please."<br><br>He slid open his cell phone. "Hey," he said. "Good, man, good. You? Yeah. Yeah, that. No, hey, listen, it's off, forget it. No, yeah, Miz Mangjeol ain't interested. What? I don't know." Yoon tucked the map back into her purse, slung it back over her shoulder and started to leave the cafe. Ms. van Meergeren had taken the opportunity to make some headway on her couscous but she was still occasionally looking up toward the glass. "Hey, Miz Mangjeol, wait up. Man's got some questions. You want to explain the situation to him?"<br><br>"I'd rather not," she said coolly, "but I'll explain the situation to you if you like, and then you may convey it to him in your charming idiolect so that everyone is on the same page."<br><br>"Would you?"<br><br>Yoon turned and stepped back indoors. She spoke very clearly. "Raiixia, an island kingdom in the North Pacific Ocean, has been overtaken by a rebelling minority led by a Raiixian insurgent named Fahyrv Gharlyul Bakhann. The people Ms. van Meergeren is representing would like me to travel there and gather information about the new government's activities. I'm assuming she's either speaking for the royal family who wishes to reclaim the country or indeed for an entirely separate party looking to conquer Raiixia while it's vulnerable."<br><br>Mr. Mayordomo, who had nodded along for all of this, returned his attention to the cell phone. "Okay, here it is," he said. "They took over an island called Reyxia in the Pacific and some winged guy named, like, Five Girl Backhand is behind the coup. Yeah, maybe they all got wings over there, I don't know. Some crazy shit over there. And now the lady who invited Miz Mangjeol here wants her to be, like, a <i>spy</i> for the old government. We think. She thinks." Yoon was satisfied. The story sounded flimsy and absurd. There was no way the trip would be approved. Mr. Mayordomo listened for a moment, then looked back up at Yoon. "He wants to know how much is bein' offered."<br><br>"She said I would be paid handsomely."<br><br>He repeated this into the cell phone, but then shook his head. "Not specific enough," he told Yoon. "Can we get an exact figure?"<br><br>Yoon's eyes widened. Surely Mr. Mayordomo's boss wasn't actually <i>considering</i> the -- "As you've already told him, I'm not interested!" she spat out.<br><br>"<i>He's</i> interested," Mr. Mayordomo replied evenly.<br><br>She frowned at him. He smiled. She pushed open the glass door and returned to the outdoor tables, not holding it open for him on his way out. She sat back down at the table across from Ms. van Meegeren, leaving Mr. Mayordomo to pull a chair from another empty table. "Please excuse me for asking," she said, "but I'm afraid my employer is likely to call me back to the Archipelago if I can't persuade him on the specifics of the job. I have to ask you to provide some estimate of the compensation I can expect..."<br><br>And with the merest movement of her hand, she placed a fresh sheet of paper on the table by Ms. van Meegeren's plate. She had to rummage around a bit for the pen, though.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Kaina'mei watched as Yoon and the man who had interrupted them walked inside the cafe for a moment. She started to worry. Would she accept despite the inherent danger of being caught? Was she yet tipped off that Kaina'mei was asking on behalf of the royals? Yoon finally returned to the table and handed her a blank sheet of paper and a pen, asking for concrete figures. Kaina'mei trembled ever so slightly when she reached for the pen. She couldn't believe Yoon was actually considering the offer. Composing herself, she finally said, "Well, it would all depend on how well you do retrieving the information. Supposing that you bring back for us a wealth of very valuable information and go above and beyond the line of duty, we're probably looking at..."<br><br>Kaina'mei held the pen steady, scribbling a 1, then a zero, and then another zero, until she had written down six zeros behind the straight and sharp one, finishing it off with a C bisected with two short lines. "One million Euros. We are aware of how dangerous and difficult this job is, and we wish to reward you appropriately."</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Beelzebibble</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Yoon sank slightly. What could have possessed Ms. van Meegeren to name the figure <i>aloud?</i> What had she thought the pen and paper were for, a game of Morpion solitaire? Really, Yoon had expected a dame of Europe to show more decorum than this. When the woman had first attempted to start in on negotiations without a breath of idle chat, Yoon had catalogued her behavior as "earnest in a somewhat charming way." Now that she had failed to pick up on this elementary cue, Yoon wondered whether the better category for Ms. van Meegeren might not simply be "gauche."<br><br>So crumbled Yoon's plan, hatched of a moment, to gently peel off a zero or two from the figure before passing the sheet to Mr. Mayordomo. It would have been a simple thing. Merely boldening the remaining numbers would have accounted for the surplus of ink. <br><br>If only decorum had prevailed!<br><br>Mr. Mayordomo whistled.<br><br>"She's offerin' a <i>million euros</i>," he told the phone, leaning back in his chair. "Yeah. No. Hey, no! It's the God's honest, man! You want her to tell you herself?" He jerked his chin toward Ms. van Meegeren in a gesture Yoon somehow suspected the man on the other end was unlikely to appreciate. "Fine, okay. Yeah, she wrote it down and everythin'."<br><br>Yoon pulled the sheet of paper and pen back to herself. With a quick movement of her fingers, she folded up the sheet of paper perhaps once more than was really necessary and slipped it into her purse. She gave Ms. van Meergeren a tight-lipped smile.<br><br>"What? Hey, man, I don't know, I'm not an economist." Mr. Mayordomo cupped his free hand over his free ear to block out the abysmal music. "Oh, is it? Hey! Really?" He smiled broadly at Yoon. "That's about a million-and-a-quarter dollars!"<br><br>"How surpassingly generous," Yoon cooed, knowing perfectly well where most of the money would end up.<br><br>Mr. Mayordomo squinted up into the sky as he listened to the other man's words, then evidently remembered his sunglasses and put them back on. He tapped the frame a few times. "He wants to know how long this engagement is going to be," he said directly to Ms. van Meegeren.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"It shouldn't take very long to gather the information we need, but we do have to make certain preparations before you begin your job." Kaina'mei furrowed her eyebrows slightly. She wasn't sure who this man who accompanied Yoon was, but their potential spy was told that they'd prefer she'd arrive alone. She also furrowed her eyebrows at Yoon's impudence. Why, not only had she refused the lavish lodgings they'd went out of their way to provide her, but she also refused to accept the food she offered. The nerve! Who did she think she was, anyway? Even Marimai Ryoraya Nyktori, <i>the Queen herself</i>, would graciously accept the hospitality of even the poorest, most destitute pauper and thank him profusely for going out of his way to ensure she was comfortable. (Of course, she would then make sure to do the same for him!) And to waste this perfectly good and delectable pita bread! As someone who took pride in her dishes, she would have been mortified if it had been herself preparing this luncheon. Kaina'mei had no idea how Her Highness could have wanted <i>this woman</i> for the job.<br><br>This blatant disrespect, it would not do in Raiixia.<br><br>Kaina'mei thanked Ryora that this was strictly a business arrangement.<br><br>"We're predicting that it won't take longer than a month, but she will be starting in about three weeks," she informed Mr. Mayordomo. Then, she turned to Yoon, her steadfast stare softening now that Kaina'mei felt she could be trusted (even if she DID had hideous comportment!) "I apologize if I may have been a tad brisk about conducting business. This is an urgent matter and we needed to be certain that you would accept the task. However, we would like to take these three weeks to get to know you a little better. My superior is especially looking forward to meeting you." Kaina'mei polished off the last remaining bites of her couscous with accompanied sips of her tea and finally buried her fork into the tip of the cheesecake, lifting it to her lips.</div></div>

"Mr. Mayordomo, this is Annelies van Meegeren."<br><br>"Pleasure," he said.<br><br>Yoon lingered a bit over her next words, but there was no avoiding them. She faced Ms. van Meegeren's expectant stare head-on. "I accept," she said. "We shall go to Raiixia. And there's really no need to apologize for wishing to be efficient. I do tend to let my words wander if no one will prod them back onto the path..." Around this point she would have inserted an ingratiating smile, but unlike Mayordomo she didn't quite find herself up to it at the moment. "It's nothing. You can count Mr. Mayordomo and myself at your service."</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Mayordomo would be coming with her on the assignment? Kaina'mei wasn't expecting that, but if it was the only way Yoon would accept, they'd have to make appropriate arrangements. She finished the last of her cheesecake and called for the check. "We are very grateful that you have decided to accept. In about a week we will be contacting you again with information on where we will be staying to prepare you for your assignment. Until then, please enjoy this wonderful city. Unfortunately I have business to attend to elsewhere, so I must be departing quite soon. Ms. Mangjeol, Mr. Mayordomo, thank you very much for being here today, and please take care." Kaina'mei shook Mr. Mayordomo's hand, bowed deeply to Yoon, and reached into her clutch purse to pay for the food with the money Marimai had given her.<br><br>Before she left, however, she turned to a waiter and politely asked for a box to place leftovers in. Maybe it wasn't the classiest thing to do in Europe, but <i>the hell if she was going to let that pita go to waste. <b>The. Hell.</b></i><br><br>~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br><br>Maneuvering her way through the crowded Amsterdam Airport Schiphol in her posh high heels, Marimai walked at a brisk pace towards her destinated gate when suddenly her cell phone chimed. She reached into her leather purse and seeing that it was Kaina'mei calling, answered. "Kaina'mei?"<br><br>"Yes, it's me, Your Highness. Are you okay?"<br><br>"Yes, I was on my way to catch my flight. How did the meeting go?"<br><br>"As swimmingly as it could possibly go considering the circumstances."<br><br>"What do you mean by that, Kami?"<br><br>"Well, for one, her manners are terrible! Every comfort we offered her, she refused! The hotel! The food! Everything!"<br><br>Marimai immediately giggled for about a minute, something that surprised Kaina'mei given how tense she had been recently under all the stress. "Kami, she's Korean. Koreans are very humble people and they make it a point to refuse lavish hospitality, didn't I mention that on the plane to Amsterdam?"<br><br>"How strange! I don't think I could adjust to living in Korea then. You know how I am, Marimai."<br><br>"Yes, I know how incredibly hospitable you can be, and I'm not saying you were wrong in being so generous, but perhaps she didn't understand Raiixian etiquette, just as you didn't know much about her culture's. Tell you what. In a week when you see her again, at the main rendezvous point, give her a really nice gift. The Koreans are very into gift-giving. I'm sure she'll be a little less cold once you've gained her--"<br><br>"WHOA WHOA WHOA MARI, don't tell me I have to see this woman again!"<br><br>"Well, yes, I mean, I want to meet with her and get to know her, but you'll be doing most of her preparation. I'll be too busy with other matters to do it myself."<br><br>At that moment, Marimai heard a very audible groan.<br><br>"Oh come now, I'm sure once you two get to know each other better, you'll get along."<br><br>"Very well, my queen, but I'm only doing this for you."<br><br>"And I thank you very much for that. I understand how dangerous this assignment is and my eternal gratitute extends out to both you and Ms. Mangjeol, considering the consequences should you be caught. I have to go. Take care, Kaina'mei."<br><br>"Ryora's blessing be with you, my liege."
