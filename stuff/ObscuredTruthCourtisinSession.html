You think I can't tell?"<br><br>"Unusual. One does not usually find oneself being called a cheat after losing the important hand."<br><br>"Don't <i>patronize</i> me. There's no way I could've won, I haven't played since college. As if I even liked these kinda games."<br><br>"This is a game of fortune, Commissioner. How do you suppose a card game is won without fortune?"<br><br>"There's no such thing as a <i>victory</i> without <i>skill</i>. You're the ace, boy, not me." A pause. "And you are also a cheat, which I know when I see. You fixed the deck. You played to lose."<br><br>"You wound me with such slander. I never play to lose. Why should I?"<br><br>"Must be trying to lure me into a false sense of security."<br><br>"There's no honor in cheating at cards. If I can't beat someone like you under with my own skill, then I should not be playing."<br><br>"Great. Here we go. Honor among -- You think you know what <i>honor</i> is, boy? What is this, the gambler's creed? Don't get high and mighty with me, now--"<br><br>"Please. Getting high and mighty on you is second nature to most folk. Maybe it's a fault of your own."<br><br>"<i>Shut up.</i>" <br><br>Another pause. <br><br>"So: you're a liar, a cheat, <i>and</i> an elitist prick. Good. That's fine. That's just human nature. You've got people in every squalid den this side of the Pacific muttering that no one can beat you at cards, of <i>course</i> you think you're hot shit. But let me tell you this, boy. You're not better than me just 'cause you play a good game of poker. And you're sure as hell not better than me because you can feign losing and then lie your ass off about it. <i>No one</i> gets ahead by breaking the rules in Winstone. Not while I'm here to uphold them."<br><br>Silence.<br><br>"I'm very sorry for wasting your time. Who knows how many rules you could have been off enforcing tonight! All of them, perhaps. Naturally, I am sure the police force could have accomplished more in this time frame, if only you hadn't insisted on your escort."<br><br>"You arrogant son of a <i>b</i>--"<br><br>"Tut tut, Williams. You are obviously forgetting my reason for calling you here. Unless, of course, you have better things to do than pursue the criminal who has eluded your capture for the past half a decade?"<br><br>"Heh. You make him sound like my archrival... Hate to disappoint you, kid, but <i>everyone</i> in my line of work's looking for the Butterfly. Frankly, long as he's not screwing around on my turf, I couldn't care less."<br><br>"Oh really? So you're forgetting the fact that a Power managed to relieve you of your own badge from underneath your nose. It must have taken divine intervention for you to keep it, after that debacle."<br><br>"Shut <i>up</i>!"<br><br>"My apologies, again. Clearly still a sore subject. However, I hardly think it's an exaggeration to claim that you will need all the assistance offered to you. And since by some miracle you managed to win the game, I am obliged to answer all of your questions. Begin."<br><br>A faint sound of grinding.<br><br>"You're a cocky little brat."<br><br><i>Bang</i>.<br><br>~*~*~10AM, Winstone Penitentiary, Special Confinement~*~*~<br><br>"Antonio?"<br><br>Illiana stepped up to the bars of the cell, running her fingers along each metal pole rhythmically. Prisons made her nervous for some reason. The idea of being forcibly held behind bars, confined within such a small space. She suppressed a slight shiver at the thought and focused instead on why she was here. The most unlikely of events, which nothing could have braced her for.<br><br>A phone call, from an acquaintance who typically referred to himself as The Butterfly. It was barely an hour ago, her phone vibrated quietly in her jeans pocket with an incoming call from an unknown number. Unusual. Very few people even had her number, and those who did would have had little interest in sharing it. She wasn't exactly the girl to phone up for a gossip session, after all. The person phoning her called himself 'Commissioner Williams', about 'standard procedure for incarcerated criminals'. Then the phone was handed to an all-too-familar person. Antonio, requesting that she arrive at the Winstone Penitentiary as soon as possible.<br><br>"You finally got caught, did you?" She asked, keeping her tone carefully neutral. She gripped the bar her hand was currently hovering over. A slight tingle told her that this was no ordinary cell.<br><br>"Don't insult me, I am the perfect thief," Antonio retorted in a bored voice. Nothing fazed this boy. Even being sat in prison seemed like only a mild hindrance to him. In a way, Illiana was jealous. Not that she'd ever admit it.<br><br>"So how come you ended up in here?"<br><br>The cell itself was fairly typical, though it seemed a fair bit more luxurious. Still bleak grey colours and bars. However, the furniture itself was what set it aside. A comfortable armchair, a slightly bigger bed than she would have expected and a small desk with a pen and paper. Were all criminals in Winstone given this? Or was it specifically for Powers? Strange.<br><br>"Unfortunate confusion," Antonio replied, idly checking his nails. "I was engaged in a game of poker with Commissioner Williams when a murder took place. Due to the circumstances, I was the prime suspect. They charged me with being an accomplice, as it was completely unfeasible for me to have been the murderer."<br><br>"Did you kill the victim?" Illiana asked, unable to stop herself.<br><br>"I am no killer, Illiana," Antonio answered, a strange strength in his voice. "However, due to the evidence at the scene, the police are under the impression that I am associated with The Butterfly. Similarly, they think that he orchestrated the event through possible powers and contacts. The evidence they have is fairly straightforward."<br><br>"Evidence?" Illiana repeated.<br><br>"Indeed. The mere fact that I was present already threw suspicion over me," Antonio explained, nodding. "The investigation team has also acquired one of my cards, which are well known to be left in the place of the stolen object."<br><br>"Sounds like you were framed," Illiana commented. "Who'd want to frame you?"<br><br>"Someone with knowledge of my whereabouts at the time," Antonio answered. "They have more decisive evidence, however. A revolver was found at the scene of the crime, with my fingerprints on the handle. The gun itself is apparently registered to me."<br><br>"Winstone has gun laws? You're allowed to own them here?" Illiana asked, slightly surprised. <br><br>"Under specific circumstances, yes. I have never so much as held a gun, let alone possessed one. Someone has extensive resources at hand, and clearly the ability or authority to utilize them rapidly."<br><br>Illiana felt like she was still missing one key aspect, though.<br><br>"So why did you call me?" She asked. Antonio raised an eyebrow, as though the reason should have been obvious. Illiana wasn't jealous of that at all.<br><br>"I wish for you to represent me in court," he stated simply.<br><br>Illiana's grip on the bar tightened as her eyes widened. Words escape her for a moment as she tried to register what the boy had just said. Represent him? In court? Was he insane? She was a Summoner, not a defense attorney! No legal background at all!<br><br>"How do you expect me to do that?!" She demanded, gripping another bar with her second hand. She faintly registered that she and Antonio were having a strange role-reversal; shouldn't he be the one gripping the bars and shouting?<br><br>"This is no ordinary court case. With the involvement of Powers, it has been decided that common folk have no place within the proceedings. The Judge, the Prosecutor and the Defense Attorney are all to be Powers, as decided by the Grand Judicial Council. Williams is livid."<br><br>"But what does this have to do with <i>me</i>?!"<br><br>"You are one of the few Powers I know well, and one of even fewer that I trust," Antonio stated. "You are also a perfect character witness. You also know me well enough to realise, once you examine the crime scene, that murder is not my style. This specific brand of murder is even less fitting."<br><br>Illiana didn't respond. It was a lot to take in. This was completely beyond her. She had no idea how a court case was supposed to happen! She'd never even seen one, let alone know the finer points of exactly how one worked! How on Earth was she supposed to stand at the defense's bench and prove that Antonio, the most suspicious man alive, wasn't a murderer?<br><br>"Illiana, if I may interject into your internal monologue," Antonio said, ripping Illiana out of her daze. "I am aware that we have a strenuous relationship at best, and I am also aware that you suspect I am the murderer. I am entrusting this with you, because I know you."<br><br>Odd. Antonio was losing his composure. The normally sarcastic and formal boy was sounding almost sincire. Was this a ploy to get her trust, or was he being honest? Illiana couldn't tell.<br><br>"What if I refuse?" Illiana asked. Antonio responded with a short laugh.<br><br>"I find a real Defense Attorney and pray he knows what he's doing," Antonio answered. "If it was allowed, I would be my own attorney."<br><br>"Yeah, right, like the suspect would ever be allowed on the defense's bench," Illiana muttered, rolling her eyes.<br><br>"No one could twist a story like me," Antonio stated. "Hopefully you will do a passable job. I assume, of course, you will accept?"<br><br>"I don't really have much of a choice, do I?" Illiana asked.<br><br>"I'm overwhelmed to hear it," Antonio said in a bored voice, checking his nails again. <br><br>~*~*~ Winstone Penitentiary, Interview Room One~*~*~<br><br><i>"What am I getting myself into?"</i><br><br>Illiana fiddled with her green ponytail as she sat at the table. The interview room wasn't really anything like she expected either. No blinding light shining in her face. It was pretty well lit, actually. About as small as she thought it would be, but well lit and somewhat comfortable. Bland striped wallpaper and a checked carpet, a mostly metal desk. Nothing too out of the ordinary. The door was left open, so that she didn't feel too claustrophobic. That was nice of the police.<br><br>She'd been told there would be a few formalities to go through before she'd be assigned the case. A general overview of her powers was needed, to make sure that she wouldn't be able to directly influence the judge if using them. After that, she'd need to have a badge assigned, then introduced to her co-counsel who would help her through the first leg of the case. Nothing too difficult, nor time consuming.<br><br>The form in front of her wasn't anything too challenging either.<br><br><i>Name:</i> <font face="Pristina">Illiana</font><br><br><i>Age:</i> <font face="Pristina">20</font><br><br><i>Occupation:</i><font face="Pristina"> Traveller</font><br><br><i>Reason for taking the case:</i> <font face="Pristina">Request from Defendant</font><br><br><i>Powers:</i> <font face="Pristina">Limited healing and fire spells, summoning</font><br><br>Simple enough. There was some talking outside the door, just out of her eyeline. She could hear the voices, talking in hushed tones, but she couldn't hear what was being said. Probably something unimportant, at least to her. She checked the form again, just to make sure there wasn't anything she missed.<br><br>"Alright, Illiana?" A familiar voice said. She looked up to see a blue haired boy about her age grinning at her.<br><br>"Yoshimitsu?" Illiana asked, frowning slightly. "You're my co-counsel?"<br><br>"Yep!" The boy confirmed, throwing himself into the chair opposite her. "I got a tip off about it and figured you'd like a friendly face to help you out."<br><br>"I thought it was the quiet life for you?" Illiana asked, a small smile forming on her face.<br><br>She had to admit, it was a relief to have a friend beside her at this point. It was such a crazy situation, to be called up out of the blue to defend someone that she didn't really trust or even like that much over a murder accusation. How anyone was supposed to deal with that, she had no idea. <br><br>"This is quiet, compared to what stuff usually goes on," Yoshimitsu replied. "I'm not really directly involved here, all I've gotta do is give you a push in the right direction. I'm only here for today and tomorrow anyway."<br><br>"Today and tomorrow?" Illiana asked.<br><br>"Geez, didn't they tell you anything? Pretty much every case around here is made up of investigation and court proceedings. You've got today to investigate, then you're in court tomorrow," Yoshimitsu explained. "I'm the lucky guy who gets to explain a bunch of stuff to you as well."<br><br>"Explain what stuff?"<br><br>"Well, you've got the Prosecutor, for one," Yoshimitsu said. "Interesting guy from what I hear. Called Nopcsa. He's another Power, and a pretty worrying one at that. File says he can do light mind-reading, so I'll bet he's gonna lay on the scare tactics."<br><br>"Mind-reading? So why can't he just read Antonio's mind to find out if he really did it or not?"<br><br>Yoshimitsu laughed, then shook his head.<br><br>"That's not the Prosecutions job, Illiana. He's being paid for this, and probably gonna get a bonus for getting a guilty verdict," Yoshimitsu explained. Illiana's face fell at this. "Thing is, there's more to this trial than getting Antonio proven innocent, which Nopcsa wont care about."<br><br>"What's that?"<br><br>"The truth. Antonio didn't kill that man."<br><br>"You believe him? You think Antonio's innocent?" Illiana couldn't stop herself from asking.<br><br>"Nope. You know Antonio as well as I do, so you should know he wouldn't shoot someone. Dunno about killing, I wouldn't bet on it, but he definitely wouldn't shoot someone."<br><br>Illiana didn't respond immediately. She agreed, at the end of the day. Antonio wasn't the type to shoot someone. He'd think he had more class than that, and he'd probably be right about that. Even in the other world, he hadn't killed anything. Not even on the bounties. Antonio was no killer. And as for the gun, that was absolutely too common for him to even consider. The evidence told a different story, though.<br><br>"But the evidence says otherwise..."<br><br>"Do you really think the evidence is true?"<br><br>"Well, no, but..."<br><br>"And you're missing the other fact here. If Antonio didn't kill this guy, who did? Truth's more important than a guilty or not-guilty verdict."<br><br>"Okay..."<br><br>"As a defense attorney, your job is to prove that Antonio is innocent, given the evidence provided to you," Yoshimitsu said, maintaining his relaxed posture. "But this evidence isn't the only evidence available."<br><br>"Isn't it?" Illiana asked, a little desperately.<br><br>"Nope. You've got a day to investigate. This means the scene of the crime and the victim's home are open for you to have a mooch around," Yoshimitsu explained. "Actually, I think we're pretty much set here, so let's head over there now."<br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler8896919').toggle();if($('#spoiler8896919').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler8896919">Okay, this is a good point for anyone who wants to be a witness to step in.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">~*~*~11:30am Winstone City, Felice Potabile~*~*~<br><br>Felice Potabile, not the nicest of places to go. No self-respecting, law-abiding citizen would be caught dead even whispering the bar's name. It was renowned for its usual clientele; people who worked on the wrong side of the law. Thieves, murderers, arsonists, blackmailers. Whatever the crime, it was a sure bet that the criminals in question would turn up in Felice Potabile. Its grime-covered windows and sticky floor were home to one-too-many secrets.<br><br>"This place just screams 'murder case'," Illiana muttered, pushing open the door.<br><br>The police were all over the place. Many were situated outside, ensuring the public could not enter. Fewer were inside, for the space within the bar was hardly generous. A few detectives were scattered around, doing detective-y things like dusting for prints and luminol testing. All in all, it looked like a standard crime scene with very little room for misinterpretation. Some worn out chairs sat haphazardly around alcohol-stained tables, the bar looking lifeless with its grimey and dusty bottles of who even knew what kind of hell-broth.<br><br>"Shame the crime didn't happen here," Yoshimitsu commented, apparently reading Illiana's thoughts. "It was in the next room over. Let's check it out."<br><br>Illiana made her way into the adjoining room, squinting slightly in the darkness. The lights were ancient, apparently too tired and well-used to cast as strong a glow as they should. Several men were stood around with flashlights, discussing things in hushed tones. On the floor, the location of the body had been marked out with white tape. A small sign had been placed with a picture of a gun on it. Other than that, there was little else in the room.<br><br>"Are you the defense attorney on the case, ma'am?" A man in a brown overcoat asked Illiana.<br><br>"Oh, um... yes, I am," she responded hesitantly. Politeness was usually a big give away for something serious.<br><br>"I have the autopsy report here," he said, holding out a brown envelope.<br><br>"Oh, thank you," she replied, taking the envelope. It hadn't been sealed, not that she was surprised.<br><br>"Prosecutor Nopcsa probably has one of these too. He's entitled to go question Antonio too," Yoshimitsu explained briefly. "What does it say?"<br><br><i>Victim: Larry Odio<br><br>Estimated time of death: 11 - 11:30PM<br><br>Cause of death: Single bullet to the heart. Death was instantaneous.</i><br><br>"Not exactly informative, is it?" Illiana commented, showing the sheet to Yoshimitsu.<br><br>"Could do with some bulking out," Yoshimitsu agreed. "Can't make a good story out of this."<br><br>"What about the victim himself?"<br><br>"Should be another sheet about that."<br><br>Illiana looked in the envelope again and extracted a second sheet of paper.<br><br><i>Larry Odio<br><br>Age: 45<br><br>Occupation: Police Officer, Winstone Police Station<br><br>City of Residence: Winstone<br><br>Nationality: Archipelago<br><br>Notes: Served in the Police force for 20 years. Ambitious, confident and flexible. Never sought for a promotion, despite having the talent. </i><br><br>"No wonder Commissioner Williams was so worked up about this," Yoshimitsu commented.<br><br>"What?"<br><br>"Williams has a huge vendetta against powers. There was a robbery from the museum recently, really lit a fire under him," Yoshimitsu explained. "Turns out there wasn't a power involved, even though all the signs pointed towards it. Since this guy probably worked under Williams, he's probably working his ass off to pin the blame on Antonio."<br><br>"And he's going to be a witness tomorrow, isn't he?" Illiana asked, secretly hoping she was wrong.<br><br>"Looks like it."<br><br>"Great... being a defense attorney seems sort of... detrimental to your health," Illiana said slightly dejectedly. Yoshimitsu laughed.<br><br>"Yeah but keep your eyes on the prize," Yoshimitsu said. "Any lawyer's job is to look for the truth. You've got that over Nopcsa. He's gonna be after a guilty verdict."<br><br>"Right..."<br><br>"Okay, take a look at the scene and see if you can see what I see."<br><br>Illiana nodded, and looked down at the white tape. It looked very cut-and-dry to her. The victim had been shot in the heart. With instant death, he'd fallen on his front. The gun had been abandoned or dropped close to the corpse, and the culprit had fled the scene.<br><br>Hold on.<br><br>Fled to where? The only exit out of this room was into the bar. The only way the culprit could have escaped would be past Antonio and Williams, not to mention the police escort. That was suspicious. <br><br>"I guess that's why Williams pinned the blame on Antonio. Does he even know what powers Antonio has?" Illiana asked.<br><br>"Probably not. Most people only know that The Butterfly is a master thief," Yoshimitsu replied. "It's just rumors that he has powers. Still, that's enough to cast suspicion on him."<br><br>"Right."<br><br>Illiana turned her attention back to the crime scene. Something about the scene in front of her was off, but she couldn't decide what. Something to do with the body. What was it?<br><br>"What was the gun used?" Illiana asked.<br><br>"Forty-five millimeter. Pretty hefty gun. Bigger than the typical police force gun," Yoshimitsu explained. "There should be a picture in the case file."<br><br>Illiana had a quick rummage and pulled out a photo of the murder weapon.<br><br>"That's... not a small weapon," she commented.<br><br>"Nope. The kickback on that thing could dislocate your shoulder if you don't know how to use it," Yoshimitsu agreed. "Good force behind it."<br><br>Something clicked in Illiana's head.<br><br>"Wait, how much force?"<br><br>"A lot. Not enough to knock you off your feet, but enough to make you stagger at least."<br><br>"So why's the victim died on his front?" Illiana asked. Yoshimitsu laughed again.<br><br>"Very good! That's two pieces of evidence you've found so far," Yoshimitsu congratulated with a satisfied smile. "There's one more really obvious detail here."<br><br>"One more..?"<br><br>"Yeah. It's what's <i>missing</i> from the crime scene."<br><br>"Missing?" <br><br>She looked at the scene again. What on earth was missing here? Despite what Yoshimitsu said, it wasn't an obvious detail. Everything was so cut and dry, a straightforward case. She took a few steps around the room, her shoes sticking to the floor slightly. Years of spilled drinks that hadn't been cleaned, giving the floor a shiny but revolting surface in muted hues. Almost all brown, with the odd patch shinier from a more pure form of alcohol. Even around the body's location, it was a messed up mixture of alcohols and vomit. No blood though, thankfully. The sight of stale blood on top of everything else here would have turned Illiana's stomach.<br><br>Hang on.<br><br>No blood?<br><br>"Spot on, Illiana," Yoshimitsu said with a satisfied grin. <br><br>"That's... suspicious," she commented, crouching down to examine the area. "And the floor is still a mess around here, so the blood wasn't cleaned up. There just isn't any."<br><br>"Great deductive skills. We'll make a lawyer out of you yet," Yoshimitsu praised. "I think that's about it for this area, so let's head over to Odio's place."</div></div>

Two men, one thick and one narrow, stepped out and trudged along the gravel path to the front door. The narrow man rang the bell, to be answered in a moment by a sallow college-aged youth with unkempt hair. The Commissioner had met the youth once several years before at an evening gathering, but could not remember his name. He'd looked tidier then. He was a student at some university in Sinnoh; it seemed doubtful that he was already on winter break. The youth led them into the living room and went upstairs on the promise of fetching his mother. The Commissioner looked around for a moment at the relatively plain space, then eventually settled his frame into a cushioned armchair. The Inspector remained standing.<br><br>Eventually she wandered downstairs, in a black dress, with her son following behind. The Commissioner was faintly relieved to see that she wasn't crying, although by the look of her puffy, reddened eyes, her pale cheeks hadn't been dry for much too long. She lingered on the last stair, staring into the living room from the hallway. "Commissioner Williams," she said.<br><br>"Mrs. Odio," said Williams.<br><br>Her gaze turned toward the narrow man.<br><br>"This is Inspector Denham Landsvale," Williams explained.<br><br> "Spoke to you on the phone this morning..."<br><br>"Oh. Of course." Mrs. Odio stepped off the stair and walked into the living room, followed by her son, who was trailing close behind as if expecting her to collapse backward at any minute. "You remember Henry, Commissioner," she said. "From the, when was it, Christmas of--"<br><br>"Yes, yes..."<br><br>"Pleasure," said Landsvale, reaching out his hand to Henry.<br><br>The boy shook it. "Sure."<br><br>The mother sat on the couch. Henry sat next to her. "Please sit down," she told Landsvale. "'M all right, thank you," he said. She nodded. Without looking beside her, she said: "Henry. Get them something."<br><br>"No need, thank you very much, Mrs. Odio," said Williams.<br><br>"Is it time for <i>lunch</i>, should I--"<br><br>"We're absolutely fine, Mrs. Odio, but it's much appreciated. Not to worry, Henry." The boy sank back into his seat. Williams glanced at Landsvale, then leaned forward with fingers interlaced. "I just want to say how sorry I am for your--"<br><br>"<i>Don't</i>."<br><br>Williams stopped short.<br><br>"Please," Mrs. Odio added. Then, after a moment: "I'm sorry." She was looking down at the carpet. "That was rude of me. Excuse me."<br><br>"No no," the Commissioner said hurriedly, "I don't want to upset you..." Feeling that this was a somewhat weak comment on its own, he continued, "Everyone at the station is mourning. He was a great man, and we're all--"<br><br>"<i>Please.</i>"<br><br>The mother's gaze didn't waver, but Henry gave Williams a sympathetic grimace, as though apologizing for his mother's sensitivity. Williams, however, wasn't sure whether he'd ever seen anything that deserved an apology less in his life. In fact, he was dimly aware of feeling that he was an absolute idiot spitting out trite condolences with no grace or tact. He looked again to Landsvale for support, but the Inspector seemed to have locked onto the same patch of carpet and was of no use.<br><br>After another few uncomfortable beats, Mrs. Odio said, "Tell me you've found something."<br><br>With relief, Williams straightened up; this was, after all, why they'd come. "Right," he replied. "Well. I can tell you a few things, but you won't like hearing most of them."<br><br>"Save the good news for the end," said the son right away.<br><br>"Fine," said Williams. Easier that way anyhow. "To begin, I'm afraid we've come to the definite conclusion that a Power was responsible."<br><br>This started Mrs. Odio out of her reverie.<br><br>"You're <i>sure</i>?" she demanded hoarsely, staring at Williams.<br><br>"Had to be," Landsvale explained. "Combed the back room of the bar with everything we had. There were no secret exits. No good hiding places, either. Only way he could've gotten out without getting caught would be if he could teleport, phase, turn invisible... <i>something</i> abnormal."<br><br>The woman's bloodshot eyes were very wide. "But if he can teleport or turn invisible, how in God's name are you supposed to...?"<br><br>"That's not as hopeless as it sounds," Williams assured her. Then he thought about it briefly and added to the son, "Sorry, Henry, I forgot. We're going to have to go bad news, good news, bad news, good news. Damned if I can figure out how to tell it in any other order."<br><br>This actually elicited a tiny grin from the boy, even as his eyes remained sullen. "No worries."<br><br>"Well, here's the good news, part one." Williams reached into his jacket and pulled out a playing card. The ace of diamonds. He held it up. "We found this at the scene of the crime."<br><br>"Oh, my God..."<br><br>She had clapped her hands to her mouth.<br><br>"The Butterfly?"<br><br>The Commissioner nodded tightly, glad Mrs. Odio hadn't forgotten the name. She shouldn't have. After all, it was her husband who'd discovered an identical card in Williams' office the day the Butterfly had... well, robbed him. He could see that she, too, was making the connection. "But that can't mean..." she began. "You don't think -- it was some kind of <i>revenge</i> a--" She swallowed abruptly and left the question unfinished and immediately launched into another. "But how are you supposed to <i>catch</i> the Butterfly?"<br><br>"If it'll help, we may have already caught his accomplice."<br><br>That got the room's attention. Both mother and son perked up immediately. Mrs. Odio sniffled. "His accomplice?"<br><br>"You probably already know I was right there in Felice Potabile, out in the main room, when it happened." She nodded. "But do you know why?" She shook her head. "Then let me tell you. It happens I was invited there by a smarmy little kid who claimed he had information to share about the Butterfly. 'Bout your age," said Williams, gesturing to Henry.<br><br>"Was it <i>him</i>?" Henry demanded.<br><br>The Commissioner shook his head. "Couldn't've been. He was sitting down with me when we heard the shot coming from the back. Still, needless to say, soon as I saw..." He stopped short of saying "the body" and turned it instead into "...the card on the floor, I sure as hell wasn't letting that prick get away. He didn't even try to run. Knew I had a whole squadron parked outside to arrest his ass the second he gave them a reason to."<br><br>"'S sitting in a cell in the Penitentiary as we speak," affirmed Landsvale, tucking away his cell phone. "Literally. Just texted them to check."<br><br>"So if it wasn't him -- then -- but could he be the Butterfly?" Henry demanded, but with decreasing conviction.<br><br>"Could be," the Inspector went on. "Though, doubtful. They've got him in Special Confinement just to be sure, but we don't actually know whether the kid's a Power. Plus he's a little young. Would've had to start work as the Butterfly before high school, even."<br><br>"But why in Christ's name would the Butterfly put you and his... his <i>sidekick</i> in the bar at the exact time he was going to...?" <br><br>The mother trailed off.<br><br>"Mrs. Odio," said Williams heavily, "the Butterfly is known to have a twisted sense of humor."<br><br>She buried her face in her hands; "Oh my God... oh my God..." Henry pulled her aside into an embrace. He looked up to demand with renewed vigor, "So what are you gonna <i>do</i> with this kid?"<br><br>"He's standing trial tomorrow. Suspicion as an accessory to first-degree murder. And that's where we get back into the bad news." In another context Williams would have laughed as both mother and son gave him identical looks that indicated they hadn't realized any of the previous was good news. "You know the Council's ruled in Staudt's favor?"<br><br>It took a moment for the significance of this to dawn on Mrs. Odio. "<i>No.</i> You don't mean--"<br><br>"Who's Staudt?"<br><br>"Not studying for law school, are you, kid?" Landsvale asked kindly.<br><br>Henry shook his head. "Pre-med."<br><br>"Okay, that's fine then. Still. Name you'll want to know. Associate Justice of the Archipelago Supreme Court, Bartholomew Staudt. Been in law for, don't know, couple decades? But just a few years ago, he came out as a Power. Craziest thing. Right up onna podium, live television, started making little thunderbolts jump between his hands. No one'd had a clue." Landsvale sighed. "Messy situation, let me tell you. Wife divorced him not long after. Still, he got through the scandal and kept his job. Open minds prevailed and all that, and anyway, it wasn't like he was <i>hurting</i> anyone."<br><br>Williams huffed.<br><br>"Define 'hurting anyone'."<br><br>"Good point," Landsvale admitted. "Meant to say is, he wasn't frying anyone with electricity. Proved he could keep his power under control, so he stayed in the seat." <br><br>"Isn't that not hurting anyone?" asked Henry blankly.<br><br>"Oh he's been hurting people all right," Williams clarified. "He's been the most incessant pro-Power voice on the Council since his little debut. I haven't seen him give <i>one</i> Power a proper sentence in a case he was presiding over, the last few years. Always sets them about half the prison time anyone else would, and that's if they don't get off scot fucking <i>free</i>..."<br><br>"And they ruled in his <i>favor</i>?" Mrs. Odio repeated.<br><br>"What's this?" Henry asked.<br><br>"Been lobbying for about a year now for a special all-Power court. Judges, jurors, defendant, attorneys, all the key players -- even the prosecution. 'S been Staudt's little pet project. Argued that only Powers can properly understand other Powers, you know, mentality and capabilities and whatnot, so they should be the ones to judge them. And it just went through. He's presiding over all Power-related cases in the Archipelago from now on."<br><br>Landsvale shrugged as Mrs. Odio fairly shrieked, "But that's <i>obscene</i>! Who's to say he can't just rule them all innocent? Jesus Christ, what is it now, a blank check for all the Powers? <i>Forever</i>? How's anyone going to be held <i>accountable</i>?" She paused; an even darker question had occurred to her. She broke out of her son's arms and shouted in Williams' face, "What the hell did Staudt do to get the rest of the Council on board? What did he, threaten to <i>electrocute</i> them if they didn't sign the bill?"<br><br>Commissioner Williams, however, was calm. "That's where the last piece of good news comes in."<br><br>It was time for Henry to redeem himself for all his ignorance. "Who's the advising judge?" he asked slowly.<br><br>"<i>Exactly,</i>" Williams smiled. "Who is the advising judge. The advising judge is Associate Justice of the Archipelago Supreme Court, Mildred Hooper, and if that name doesn't ring a bell, Henry, then maybe 'the Inquisitor' will."<br><br>"Yeah... She's a Power too, isn't she? But she's..."<br><br>"'Bout as different from Staudt as you can get," Landsvale supplied.<br><br>"She's been on record as a Power since day one. Never hid it from the public. But as lenient on his fellow Powers as Staudt's been, she's been just as harsh on them. She's not out to give Powers a free lunch, she's out to discipline them. Bring them in line with society. And that means she hasn't shied away from giving Power criminals some <i>very</i> severe sentences." Williams leaned back in his chair and chuckled. "Hell, maybe Staudt's right: maybe their kind <i>do</i> know their kind better. Cause Hooper just has an instinct for it. She can sniff out Power involvement in the most unfathomable cases, and she'll get the right perp locked up for it. Can't tell you how many deranged miscreants she's landed a spot in max sec." He paused for a moment, remembering a few of the scarred and hateful figures who'd been led out of her courtroom in chains... "Anyway, <i>that</i>, Mrs. Odio, is how Staudt got the Council to approve his motion. Not force. Compromise. With Hooper at his side, the rest of us know there'll be <i>someone</i> in the courtroom looking out for us. And that someone is the second most important someone in the room."<br><br>"But second most important isn't good enough!" she protested. Her eyes were watering. "Just because she's advising Staudt, that doesn't mean he can't override her... And whoever -- whoever killed my Lawrence could still go free...!"<br><br>"Staudt could," Williams said simply, "if he were an idiot, which he's not, so he won't. He knows all eyes are on him here. The Council could rescind their decision any time. I'm not saying it's a <i>guarantee</i>, but he'll have no choice but to give Hooper's argument a fair ear. If the court can't find sufficient evidence to convict the killer, that's one thing, but if the case goes undecided just because Staudt was pretending he couldn't hear Hooper right next to him... You see what I'm saying?"<br><br>She blinked. She didn't seem utterly convinced. Then she said softly:<br><br>"Perry... do you trust her?"<br><br>And the Commissioner replied, "Ellen, if there is one Power in the world I trust, it's Justice Hooper."<br><br>He stood up. <br><br>"She is going to do everything she can to help you. And so is Inspector Landsvale, and so am I."<br><br>The ghost of a smile had resurfaced on young Henry's face, and more importantly, on his mother's as well.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Yoshimitsu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">~*~*~ 12:15pm, 28 Pennyroyal Drive, Winstone~*~*~<br><br>Something beeped.<br><br>Illiana turned to look at Yoshimitsu, ready to enquire about the noise when he noticed he was checking his phone. Checking his phone at a time like this? The middle of an investigation was not an appropriate time to be keeping up to date with friends and drama! Then she saw his expression change from his easy-going, carefree grin into a much more serious one indeed.<br><br>"Bad news?" She asked, slightly apprehensively.<br><br>"Sort of. The Judge and advising Judge just got announced," Yoshimitsu replied, frowning at his phone.<br><br>"Is... that bad?"<br><br>"Sort of," Yoshimitsu said again. "The Judge is okay. Staudt. He's a good man, if a bit more lenient than he should be. He's got good intentions, and definitely helpful for our case. As far as I know, he'll be interested in the truth rather than a guilty or not guilty verdict."<br><br>"But that's a good thing, isn't it?" Illiana objected.<br><br>"The Advising Judge is the issue. Hooper," Yoshimitsu explained. "Mildred Hooper. She's another Power. Didn't do what Staudt did, she was honest about being a Power from the get-go. Staudt wasn't, landed him in loads of trouble but he kept his job somehow."<br><br>"What's so bad about this Hooper woman?" Illiana asked, not really seeing the issue yet.<br><br>"She's about as far from Staudt as you can get. Every case she's ever Judged with Powers involved ended with a guilty verdict," Yoshimitsu said. Illiana felt her face fall. "Tricky situation. You've got to convince Staudt that Antonio's innocent, while somehow fending off Nopcsa. On top of that, you've got to disprove any arguments Hooper has. She's relentless when it comes to Power cases."<br><br>"I was right. Being a defense attorney is detrimental to your health," Illiana sighed, folding her arms in a defiant pose. The case was looking more and more hopeless. The only defense she had right now was that no one could prove Antonio was linked to the crime at all, outside of unfortunate happenstance. That wouldn't fly in court. Coincidences were always considered more serious and twisted to suit the prosecution, at least when it came to Powers. "Of all people, why did Antonio choose me?"<br><br>"Well, he trusts you more than the rest of us," Yoshimitsu said fairly. <br><br>"Well, just remind me to slap him when this is all over," Illiana replied. Yoshimitsu laughed and shook his head in mock-disdain. Illiana felt a smile tug at the corner of her lips, but suppressed it as best as she could. It wouldn't do for the family to see her smiling when there was a murder involved. "Can you tell me anything else about Hooper?"<br><br>"Not really. I'm not sure what her Power is, but she's managed to unearth any Power involvement in cases. Even if it's well concealed, she makes it come to light," Yoshimitsu explained. "I'm wondering if her Power is actually just being able to detect other Powers. Thing is, she's gonna get a very valid say. Staudt's been aiming for an All-Power court for a while now, and the only way he could do it was by letting Hooper be his advisor. He doesn't have a choice here, he <i>has</i> to listen to what she says or the entire thing might be called off and Antonio locked up for good. The Council can take back what they've said."<br><br>"It might help for the two views though. Maybe if we can cause enough confusion, I'll have a chance to turn the case around," Illiana considered thoughtfully, ascending the steps to the front door. She registered the door itself. Pretty nice. Not that ceramic plastic rubbish that was so popular nowadays. Real wood, with a deep red finish. Pretty snazzy.<br><br>"Yep, I think Antonio made the right decision, asking you. Oh and... Be careful what you say in there. Odio's family probably wont be happy that we're here, even less happy that we're investigating," Yoshimitsu warned. "They aren't the most Power-tolerant people, and Odio being murdered probably just made all Powers irredeemable in their eyes."<br><br>"Right. Let's just get this over with," Illiana said.<br><br>She knocked on the door. Just inside, she could hear conversation suddenly stopping and some shuffling as someone stood up. A moment later, the door opened a crack. Stood in the gap was a man in uniform, a sour expression on his face.<br><br>"Commissioner Williams," Yoshimitsu greeted calmly. "I take it you haven't met the defense attorney on this case. This is Illiana."</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Beelzebibble</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">At the knock on the front door, Inspector Landsvale stepped forward. "I'll get it," he offered, but he stopped once he saw Williams move. "Allow me," said the Commissioner, moving his bulky frame out of the living room. If a door would need to be slammed in a face, he could not count upon Denham Landsvale to do it. Decent enough cop but Williams'd met pigeons on the street who asserted themselves better. "Not expecting anyone, folks, are you?" he added on seeing the curious expressions of Mrs. Odio and Henry.<br><br>They shook their heads. "But let 'em in if it's someone important," said Henry.<br><br>Williams nodded and stepped out into the hall, his feet falling heavily on the padded carpet. Another two silhouettes, more similar to each other in stature than the Inspector and the Commissioner, were faintly visible beyond the frosted glass of the front door. Consoling neighbors who'd baked a pie if Williams was lucky. Evangelicals if he wasn't. <br><br>He began to open the door, caught a glimpse of green hair, and kept it only an inch open. He grimaced. Whatever contentment and optimism he had found while discussing Mildred Hooper now slinked away. Standing at the door were a young blue-haired man and a young green-haired woman, both in street clothes. He'd forgotten Evangelicals weren't the worst-case scenario.<br><br>The young man said, "Commissioner Williams. I take it you haven't met the defense attorney on this case. This is Illiana."<br><br>Williams' eyebrows rose. "Oh, is it? You'll have registered at the station, the penitentiary or the court, then? So you'll have an approved form. Good. Show it to me, please. Your ID, too." He edged the door a further few inches open to address the blue-haired youth. "Incidentally, friend, you can take it I've never met <i>you</i> either. I'll need your identification along with hers. Then we can talk about whether you two are setting foot inside this house."<br><br><i>Don't hold your breath,</i> he mentally added. He strongly doubted whether Mrs. Odio would appreciate being confronted with a girl who was trying to look like she belonged to that fucked-up South Pole clan.</div></div>

I believe you spoke on the phone to Illiana, at Antonio's request. These are all the forms we needed to fill in, signed and stamped by a member of the Council."<br><br>Illiana seemed to shrink a little. Yoshimitsu was much more confident than she was, and much better at handling any situation. Why had Antonio chosen her, and not him?<br><br>"My name is Yoshimitsu, I'm the co-counsel for the first day of the proceedings," Yoshimitsu continued, holding up the papers in question. "I'm guessing you got the right files this morning? We already have a warrant to investigate the place." Yoshimitsu produced another sheet of paper from the selection.

Furthermore, I didn't get any files about you this morning, so it seems you <i>guessed</i> wrongly as well. That's oh for two so far. You want to keep trying, or call it a--?"<br><br>"That Miss Silna?" came a voice behind him.<br><br>He half-turned back into the hallway, still keeping a firm hand on the doorknob. It was Landsvale. "What?" Williams growled.<br><br>"Illiana Silna. Talked to her on the phone, oh, ten thirty-ish? Defense attorney, right?"<br><br>"So she claims," said the Commissioner, but he opened the door a few inches wider to allow Inspector Landsvale to have a look at the newcomers. Without making any effort to hush his voice, he added: "Inspector, if you spoke to the potential defense attorney on the phone, this would have been a fantastic thing to tell me at some point before we got here."<br><br>Landsvale looked momentarily taken aback. Then he lowered his head. "I was going to tell you once the files came in, Commissioner, but they hadn't by the time we left and I'd forgotten." He swallowed. "'M very sorry."<br><br>"Her files aren't in? They should have gone straight to me." Williams turned to the girl and asked sharply, "Where did you fill out these forms?"<br><br>"The penitentiary," Landsvale supplied. "Not the station. She'd just been talking to the defendant when she called us. So, told her she could fill out the paperwork there. But -- just found out -- the penitentiary's fax machine's busted. They had to drive the copies over to the station. Text from the front desk," he added, holding up his cell phone in anticipation of Williams' query. "We've got the copies of her files now. Everything ought to be in order."<br><br>The fax machine busted. Christ, it was always something. Commissioner Williams took the originals from the boy with the wannabe-Japanese name and read each one, slowly, in turn.<br><br><hr><i>Name:</i> <font face="Pristina">Illiana</font><br><br><i>Age:</i> <font face="Pristina">20</font><br><br><i>Occupation:</i><font face="Pristina"> Traveller</font><br><br><i>Reason for taking the case:</i> <font face="Pristina">Request from Defendant</font><br><br><i>Powers:</i> <font face="Pristina">Limited healing and fire spells, summoning</font><hr><br>He hadn't taken in more than the first line of this page before his eyes lifted to direct a withering look at the green-haired girl. "You know, human beings ordinarily sign official documents with their first <i>and</i> last names. Just a tip. Keep it in mind for next time."<br><br>But the absence of a surname -- "Silda" or whatever Landsvale had said -- wasn't exactly going to be enough for Williams to reject this document if it'd already been approved by a Council member. He read through the rest of the form. Twenty years old -- Christ. A <i>kid</i>. Barely any older than Henry. "Traveller"... <i>for that, read "drifter",</i> he thought miserably. Where did they find these people? At "fire spells" he was struck with a sudden vision of the Odio residence engulfed in flames; "limited" was a meaningless qualifier... And then Williams read "summoning", his fingers clenched on the paper, and he fixated on the girl again with a sudden, violent start.<br><br>So the green hair wasn't just a rebellious fashion choice. This girl <i>was</i> associated with the South Pole Summoners. He edged back slightly without letting go of the door, half expecting her to raze the house at any second. Destruction was second nature to these vermin! "Request by defendant" -- well, if the card-playing brat really had arranged Larry Odio's murder, this girl would be a nice choice of defense attorney, wouldn't she? Sure, just send her along to the Odio place with a search warrant and have her kill off the whole family for good measure! Williams  thought of the watery-eyed Mrs. Odio in the living room, looking to him for confidence, guidance, protection; of pale Henry, wanting the good news last, asking for some sliver of hope in this catastrophe. Would he be risking their lives by allowing in the equivalent of a terrorist sympathizer?<br><br>And in the name of God, who on the judicial council had just happened to be visiting the penitentiary this morning and had signed off on such an outrageous choice of attorney?<br><br>But Williams knew before he even reached the bottom of the page.<br><br><hr><i>APPROVED BY COUNCIL MEMBER:</i> <font size="4"><u><font face="Monotype">Bartholomew Staudt</font></u></font><br><i>Date:</i> <u>xx/xx/xxxx</u><hr><br>Williams glared back up at the pair on the doorstep. He opened his mouth to speak, and obligingly, his mind supplied at that very instant the trump card which could mean he'd still be able to turn them away.<br><br>"I notice you ignored my request for identification," he observed. "Personal identification, not our forms. Your ID, please. Yes, you too, friend. I already asked you both."</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Yoshimitsu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"ID? No problem," Yoshimitsu responded, producing a black leather wallet from his jacket. He slipped out a white driving liscence, valid for Archipelago driving. Illiana pulled out a similar card, but a blue learner's provisional liscence. She eyed the holographic card in her friend's hand slightly enviously.<br><br>"As for my forms," Yoshimitsu continued, handing over the penultimate sheet in his hand to Williams. As he did so, something occured to Illiana.<br><br>"Commissioner, can I just say something?" Illiana asked, stepping out from behind Yoshimitsu. Something was clicking together in her mind. Brute force wasn't the way through the door. Even if Williams had some weird vendetta against powers, judging from the nasty look he shot at her while reading her forms, showing that she was reasonable might help. "Legally, you can't stop us right now, because we've got this warrant but... I mean... Do you want to call in a guard? Some officers to make sure we don't threaten anyone?"<br><br>She noticed Yoshimitsu shifting behind her, and she rather fancied that he'd just put his hand on his hip. Technically speaking, by signing up to the case, she'd promised not to cause undue stress or damage to anyone involved but somehow she didn't think Williams would believe that. Compromise, hopefully that might appeal to him more. After all, it's what Staudt's proposal approved. Maybe it'd work again. The threat was still there, that they would enter the house regardless because, legally, nothing was standing in their way any more. However, maybe Williams would respond better if she could suggest a peaceful alternative.<br><br>"Or if you'd like, you could take Mrs Odio out for dinner or something while we check out the house?" Illiana continued, hoping one of the solutions might result in a quicker entry to the house. "We don't need to ask her questions right now."</div></div>

The girl was, in fact, Illiana Silna, and everything was, in fact, as Landsvale said, in order. After looking at the other license, however, he barely managed to refrain from rolling his eyes. So this Caucasian-looking kid was such a Japan lover he'd not only changed his last name, but actually gotten his first and middle names <i>filed off</i> in some town hall somewhere. Williams extended his condolences across space and time to whichever hapless civic employee had processed the name change, considering they'd probably lost their job shortly after laughing in "Yoshimitsu's" face.<br><br>As he handed the newcomers back their identifications with a nod, Silna put forth her unexpected offer. The Commissioner blinked in surprise. He looked to Landsvale, who motioned toward his phone, signalling he was ready to call for backup at a word from his superior... but Williams hesitated. If Silna and Mr. Yoshimitsu (his mind supplied the honorific with a curious backhanded defiance) were planning to murder the Odios and demolish the house, politeness certainly wouldn't compel them to wait until additional officers had arrived. And if, on the other hand -- and as was seeming increasingly likely -- they had no such intentions, then he'd simply have wasted a few more hours of his men's time. He still remembered very clearly the brat's words to him at the card table, and the sting of shame and anger they'd roused in Williams: "<i>Naturally, I am sure the police force could have accomplished more in this time frame, if only you hadn't insisted on your escort...</i>"<br><br>The Commissioner's own superiors had not been impressed that he hadn't been able to apprehend the definite murderer with an entire squadron parked outside Felice Potabile.<br><br>"That's thoughtful of you," he told the girl, "but I think the Inspector and I can handle ourselves if anything goes wrong." He was a bit surprised by his own phrasing; while this wasn't <i>too</i> opaque a statement, it was a good deal less transparent than telling them he and Landsvale would be ready to shoot them if they started acting like they needed a bullet between the eyes. Williams supposed he could appreciate Silna's attempt to be reasonable. He stepped aside and opened the door fully. "As for Mrs. Odio and her son, it's their decision whether they'd like to leave or stay. Anyhow, I guess you two check out. Come in, then."<br><br>As they stepped in off the porch, Landsvale went ahead into the living room; Williams heard him inform the Odios that the defense attorney and her co-counsel had arrived with a search warrant. When the newcomers followed the Inspector, he began the introductions: "This is Illiana Silna, just appointed the attorney. Her co-counsel, Yoshimitsu."<br><br>"And they have the pleasure of meeting Ellen and Henry Odio," Williams announced from the hall after shutting the front door.<br><br>The last to file into the living room, he saw that Mrs. Odio hadn't stood up to greet her new guests. Williams doubted she would have been eager to meet the defense attorney under any circumstances, but there was more than dislike registering in her expression. An anxious twitch confirmed her understanding of what Silna's green hair signified, and Mr. Yoshimitsu's blue hair clearly wasn't doing anything to assuage her worries. A modest "How do you do?" was the best she could muster. Henry, though, had apparently decided to put a brave face on it. "Hey, I'm Henry," he muttered, shaking their hands in turn. <br><br>Something about seeing Larry Odio's son, the Summoner, and her probable-Power comrade cluster briefly in the living room stirred a sudden pang in the Commissioner. It felt strangely like regret, though for no fault of his own. In another moment, though, he understood. The sight of these three young adults, so close in age, gathered together... They could almost have been college friends, the other two perhaps come to visit Henry on break. They could have lived in a dorm together, shared classes, gone partying on the weekends. They could have become lifelong companions -- but the colors of the guests' hair broke up the picture and precluded it from being perfect outside of the imagination. Illiana Silna and Yoshimitsu had made the decision to cut themselves off from normal society and there was nothing Perry Williams could do about that.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Yoshimitsu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Illiana gratefully stepped into the house, mumbling her thanks to the commissioner as she passed. It was a nice home. As far as homes went it was the most comfortable she'd ever visited, not that she'd had much experience. There was a strong influence of family values. In every picture in the hallway she saw, the three family members stood in the same position. Larry Odio, then slightly in front was his wife, and in front of them both was the son. She smiled faintly, but quickly controlled it when she realised that she'd be meeting the victim's family.<br><br>"This is Illiana Silna, just appointed the attorney. Her co-counsel, Yoshimitsu."<br><br>"And they have the pleasure of meeting Ellen and Henry Odio."<br><br>An auburn woman sat in armchair within the living room. Illiana did not blame her for not standing to greet her. Doubtless, the summoner was not the first person that Mrs. Odio wanted to see right now. She noticed a quick glance to her hair, which only confirmed her suspicions. This was going to be a tricky situation, but she couldn't decide on where to start first. As a means of gaining a bit of confidence, she turned to Yoshimitsu.<br><br>"Please don't lose your temper with the Commissioner," she requested, her eyes locking with the boy in front of her. He looked unimpressed, and kept on glaring briefly at Williams. "There's no need to be hostile. Our... My job is to gather evidence, not offend the people who might help us."<br><br>"Can you handle the investigation by yourself?" Yoshimitsu asked, his expression changing to one of concern. Illiana would have smiled in any other situation. <br><br>"Trust me on this one," Illiana said.<br><br>"Alright then," Yoshimitsu replied, nodding. "I'll be outside smoking. I need to make a couple of calls, too."<br><br>"Okay."<br><br>Yoshimitsu nodded to Williams, then left the room. The sound of the front door closing filled the room, then an uncomfortable silence fell. <br><br>"Mrs. Odio, I'm going to be honest now," Illiana started apprehensively. "I don't think Anto- the suspect commited the crime."<br><br>She paused for a second to gather her thoughts, ignoring the looks on everyone's faces.<br><br>"But I'm not after an innocent verdict. If the suspect is found innocent, then that's only a bonus for me. Mrs. Odio, what I'm looking for is the truth. I want to find to killed your husband, and why."<br><br>She paused again, and looked Ellen Odio in the eye.<br><br>"And I want the culprit to feel the full extent of the law."<br><br>She took a deep breath, and waited a moment to allow the full impact of her words to sink in.<br><br>"I know I've got a search warrant, but... I'd rather ask you. Can I look around your house for evidence regarding the murder case?"</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Commissioner Williams had to credit Silna with a little self-awareness; she was obviously trying not to step on anyone's toes. He couldn't say it looked as if she'd sold Mrs. Odio, though, who hadn't yet shown she was able to hold eye contact with Silna for longer than a second or two at a time. Her eyes kept flitting down to the coffee table in front of her knees, and Williams briefly wished he and Landsvale had accepted her offer and at least had a cup of coffee when they'd arrived: It would have given her some china now to bustle noisily into the kitchen. Instead she was resigned to sitting stock-still as the green-haired girl addressed her.<br><br>"I know I've got a search warrant, but... I'd rather ask you. Can I look around your house for evidence regarding the murder case?" <br><br>Mrs. Odio drew in a slow breath, then responded quietly, "I don't really have a choice, do I."<br><br>Immediately Silna opened her mouth to protest, her eyebrows pained, but the mother anticipated her. "No, yes, I understand," she went on. "Thank you for asking. Yes... Feel free. Miss Silna," she repeated under her breath, just to confirm the name, apparently.<br><br>The Commissioner cleared his throat.<br><br>"Landsvale and I will stay here for the duration of Ms. Silna's search," he volunteered. "So, Ellen, if you and Henry don't want to stick around -- we'll..." He uncharacteristically left the sentence unfinished, but did his best to convey the intended meaning -- a caution of the still-potential danger the Odios might accept by staying through the investigation -- with a grim jerk of the head.<br><br>Henry was faster to pick up on it. "Yeah -- mom -- if you want to head out, I'll--" But she caught on almost immediately after: "Yes, dear -- why don't you take the car and..." Then they both fell into an awkward silence. Williams could tell they were both thinking the same thing.<br><br>"Really don't have to stay," Landsvale reaffirmed gently.<br><br>But neither mother nor son made to depart.<br><br>"I think..." the mother muttered eventually. "I think we might stay." She gave Henry a sharp look, possibly on the verge of insisting that he clear out, but whatever strength she would have needed to command him had apparently escaped her. "We'll... be down here. Commissioner -- make sure she has everything she needs, will you?"<br><br>Commissioner Williams caught Mrs. Odio's eye long enough to nod smartly before she fixated on the coffee table again.<br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler5609939').toggle();if($('#spoiler5609939').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler5609939"><i>OOC: The layout of the house is yours to design, obviously, Elliot.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Thank you," Illiana said sincirely when Mrs. Odio had allowed her to search the building. She bowed slightly. "I promise you, I'll make sure the culprit is brought to justice."<br><br>She stood up straight again and turned, headed back into the hallway. There was a staircase there, if she recalled correctly, and the first place to examine would be the victim's bedroom. As far as stairs went, these were surprisingly steep. Probably an older house, refurbished. Must have cost a pretty penny. Illiana put that thought to the back of her mind as she reached the top of the stairs, and was presented with a selection of doors. The Commissioner was right behind her.<br><br>"Which room is Mrs. Odio's?" She asked, not wanting to barge into every room. Williams pointed to a room at the end of the landing. Plain white doors, she noticed. Still completely clean. The wallpaper was very modest, a simple cream colour with a subtle raised design, soft ridges and grooves covering the walls. A few pictures of the family hung on the walls. It was with a slight pang of sadness that she stopped to examine one. All three of the Odios, stood in front of a crystal clear lake, happy smiles on their faces. The carpet underfoot, too, was understated but homely; a faded red, well-worn surface. She passed two doors, the son's bedroom and the bathroom she guessed, before reaching the final location. <br><br>She turned the doorknob and pushed open the door. It moved silently, and very easily. Presumably the hinges were new, or at least well-oiled. The red carpet from the hallway stopped, turning into a soft cream colour. Underfoot, it felt barely touched. Was it cleaned regularly? Illiana pushed this detail from her mind too. Stay on task, she told herself. The bed rested underneath the window, a king-size with the duvet and pillows in position perfectly. Two wardrobes sat on opposite walls, and on either side of the bed was a dressing table. A large painting of the family rested on the wall opposite the bed. Illiana frowned at it. There was someone else in the painting. A tall, thin man, with thinning brown hair that had some grey streaks in it, dressed in an immaculate black suit with white shirt. The entire family looked smart. Mr. Odio dressed in a dark grey suit with a blue tie, Henry in a shirt with the top button undone and Mrs. Odio in a modest lilac dress. They looked like the perfect family.<br><br>"Who's this man?" Illiana asked Williams.<br><br>"Charles Dacten," the Commissioner replied gruffly, looking at the painting. "Friend of the family, worked with Mr. Odio regularly."<br><br>"Dacten..." Illiana repeated. She pulled a small notepad and pen from her pocket and jotted down the name on the list.<br><br><hr><font face="Pristina">Evidence:<br>Autopsy Report - Bullet to the heart, instant death<br>Crime photo - No exits from room, no blood<br>Murder weapon - 45 caliber gun, heavy recoil<br>Charles Dacten - Family friend</font><hr><br><br>She slipped the notepad back into her pocket and turned to look at the room again. It was highly unlikely that any evidence would be on display, so it was time to do some rummaging. She walked over to one of the dressing tables and opening the drawer. Foundation, eyeliner, lipstick, lip-gloss, eyeshadow, blusher... Probably Mrs. Odio's table. Nothing immediately remarkable, all very typical objects for a woman to have. She closed the drawer again and glanced quickly under the table. A few pairs of shoes. It was a long-shot anyway. The door opened again as she was standing up, and Yoshimitsu walked into the room.<br><br>"That was quick," Illiana commented. <br><br>"I'm to the point when I have to be," Yoshimitsu replied, the carefree grin back on his face. Illiana nodded, and walked around the bed to the other dressing table.<br><br>As soon as she touched the table, she knew something was off.<br><br>"What is it?" Yoshimitsu asked, noticing Illiana's hesitation.<br><br>"Magic leaves traces," she muttered, opening the drawer.<br><br>The usual assortment of items, though a surprising quantity of them. Some aftershave, hair gel, a comb, some cologne. There was something in this table that was leaving a strange tingling sensation in Illiana's hands. She picked up each bottle in turn before placing them on the table. With each bottle she moved, the drawer emptied further and further. Finally, she pulled out a small, transparent vial. Inside, there was a pale blue glowing substance. Not liquid, solid or gas. It just seemed to exist.<br><br>"Yoshimitsu, take a look at this," Illiana requested, showing the vial. Yoshimitsu stared at it for a moment.<br><br>"Bottled magic," Yoshimitsu commented. "I'd have to send it for some tests, but if I had to guess... That's a non-lethal type of magic."<br><br>"How can you be sure?" Illiana asked.<br><br>"The type of glow, the colour, amount of magic," Yoshimitsu listed briefly. "There's a bunch of giveaways. I can tell you straight away that it's magic designed for a specific purpose. Raw magic can't be contained inside glass, it has to be something organic."<br><br>"Organic?" Illiana asked, her mind full of imaged of glowing rats and birds. <br><br>"Araini, for example," Yoshimitsu said. "He holds his magic inside his body, it's why he's so adaptable."<br><br>"Right," Illiana said, nodding. "But this raises the question... Why did Mr. Odio have this?"<br><br>"Commissioner Williams, can I ask you to take this to Justice Hooper for testing?" Yoshimitsu asked, taking the vial from Illiana and offering it to Williams. "There's every chance this could be an important piece of evidence. Justice Hooper would surely be able to verify the contents of this."</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Beelzebibble</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Who's this man?"<br><br>Commissioner Williams had noticed the portrait too. Strange. He'd never pegged the Odio family for much wealth, but they must have had a few dollars under the mattress to indulge in an old-fashioned painting like this instead of getting a photograph like the rest of middle-class suburbia. There were Larry and Ellen in their Sunday best; Henry between them, a few years younger and a few inches shorter, probably not even a high school senior yet; and on Larry's other side... well, well.<br><br>"Charles Dacten," he said aloud in answer. "Friend of the family, worked with Mr. Odio regularly."<br><br>And that was all he said. Pressed further, he might conceivably have added that Dacten was a forensic expert on the force; that the tall, slightly balding man had been Larry Odio's closest friend since long before Henry had been born; and that Larry and Ellen had named him the godfather upon Henry's birth (there was no godmother; Dacten had never taken a wife). However, Silna simply took out a notepad on which she'd already written a few things and added another line, probably Dacten's name. Williams opened his mouth to protest, but closed it again. He was ready to point out that, quite apart from having worked with Dacten for many years (if not as closely as Odio had), Williams couldn't see that a forensic expert was likely to think he could commit a murder and get away with it... but Silna wasn't necessarily jotting his name down as a suspect. Whatever she wanted to commit to memory was her business.<br><br>Anyway, he wouldn't have had much time to discuss the point, since at that moment blue-haired Mr. Yoshimitsu came waltzing into the bedroom, very considerately bringing the smell of tobacco with him. The Commissioner wrinkled his nose. He'd have to check the bathroom for some Lysol spray after the defense team departed.<br><br>After Silna and Mr. Yoshimitsu exchanged a few words, she stopped and touched the dressing table with a thoughtful expression. Then she began rummaging through the contents of the top drawer. Gentleman's hygiene products: aftershave, cologne, and so on -- the departed's effects. Finally, from the very back of the drawer, she extracted an unlabelled vial containing some kind of blue phosphorescent substance and showed it to Mr. Yoshimitsu. They speculated that it was "bottled magic", which sounded a little optimistic in Williams' view. To him it looked like a glowstick, the kind of thing Courtney and Alicia would take home from birthday parties. He could well remember Courtney tugging the newspaper out of his hands a few months ago, imploring him to turn the light off so they could "have a Star Wars fight..."<br><br>But then Silna handed him her find, and that sensation put his attention very firmly in the present.<br><br>"Commissioner Williams, can I ask you to take this to Justice Hooper for testing?" asked Mr. Yoshimitsu. "There's every chance this could be an important piece of evidence. Justice Hooper would surely be able to verify the contents of this."<br><br>"Uh..."<br><br>Williams made a bad start at responding and let it rest for a moment. He was too taken aback by the feeling of the luminous vial in his palm to articulate anything. This was no glowstick, unless they made them with uranium these days. It was cold, and tingled faintly, and felt -- <i>alien</i>, his mind supplied. Otherworldly. As he clutched it, images of locations he'd been earlier that day flickered nonsensically through his brain: the living room downstairs, the neighborhood outside, the police station lobby, his office, the driveway at home, the hallway outside Alicia's My Little Pony-decorated bedroom door... Then the images ran down. Williams blinked at the two youths.<br><br>"I can't say I imagine Mildred Hooper," he said slowly, "or Staudt, for that matter, would have an easier time figuring this out than you or me. Her power isn't focused on this kind of thing." <i>Though if you were hoping to freak Mrs. Odio out a little less, Hooper would be your go-to woman,</i> he felt an insane impulse to add, and a bizarre chuckle almost escaped his lips.<br><br>What <i>were</i> the options? If this were a genuine supernatural artifact, the Winstone Police Department wouldn't have direct access to the equipment necessary to analyze it. And if it were a potentially useful piece of evidence with regard to the imminent trial, their possibilities in shipping it to a private laboratory for testing were limited. Who had a facility close enough to Winstone that Williams could send the vial there overnight and have it back by the afternoon?<br><br>But Williams knew the answer before the question had fully formed.<br><br>The Foundation, obviously.<br><br>"However, it happens that our department is in contact with a paranormal research organization. Appraising the contents of this vial would probably be child's play to them, I suppose." The Commissioner held the object up. "I commend your spotting," he added heavily to Silna. "What in God's name Larry Odio would have wanted with something like this..."<br><br>He moved out of the bedroom and into the second-floor bathroom. No Lysol that Williams could see, but that didn't matter. What mattered right now was containment, and, not knowing the defense attorney would be investigating, he hadn't left the station with any proper containment equipment. He plucked a nearly-empty bottle of shampoo off the shower rack, unscrewed the cap, poured the remnants into the sink, and then rinsed the interior out. Then he wrapped the vial carefully in paper towels from the sink counter and tucked it into the bottle. He screwed the cap back on and placed the makeshift container into a pocket of his coat, pondering all throughout.<br><br>He had long counted Saeptum as a valued associate. It had been Williams who'd convinced the municipality to sink quite a fair bit of Winstone taxpayers' money into reinforcing several of the penitentiary's cell blocks using special Power-constraining technology which the Saeptum Foundation had developed. And the investment had paid off <i>very</i> handsomely in the intervening years. Not a single Power inmate had broken free from Winstone Penitentiary since the refurbishing. They might be hard to get ahold of, Williams often reflected with a fierce pride, but once he had 'em, he never lost 'em.<br><br>Still, Saeptum's higher-ups were notoriously fickle. There was no guaranteeing their service. Williams supposed he'd have to promise a substantial recompense to convince anyone in the organization to analyze the vial so quickly and on such short notice. But if that was the price of truth and justice, so be it.<br><br>Before heading back into the bedroom, he paused to wash his hands in the sink. Sensing that one stern scrubbing would be insufficient, he gave them a twice-over. They still felt suspiciously tingly.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Tika tika tsss tat ta tat tat tsss tika tika tss tat ta tat tat—wacha!"<br><br>A fractal of pitch black exploded in the air in front of Antonio's jail cell. The repeating spines on spines spun and shifted, creating an increasingly intricate web of symmetry. It soon became apparent that there were four central points to the fractal arranged in a tight diamond. The central points moved in unison to form a square then broke apart. Spines and spirals receded to the four points while retaining the complex crossing paths.<br><br>"Pff ba da pffff shwicky shwicky POW!"<br><br>The four smaller fractals rotated laterally then flew up toward the ceiling, landing in the four corners of Antonio's cell. A man dressed in a white, sleeveless coat stood outside the cell. His right hand, covered in a white cloth glove with repeating patterns of black over it, was outstretched and gesturing at the newly placed ink spots. A similar fractal appeared on his left forearm, which was covered in a long white glove. The man pulled back his right hand and waved it over his left sleeve, the fractal set losing its definition and melting into a black mass. He then grinned and turned his head toward a woman who was standing nearby.<br><br>Julia was not impressed, nor was she amused, entranced, or fascinated by Barclay Edward Trent's antics. She had to put up with the incessant beat boxing and "dancing" for the past hour while he reinforced the magic guards on the jail cell . He was good at what he did—very good, there was no doubting that—but the sheer unprofessionalism really irked her.<br><br>"Can you just finish checking the security?" Julia said. She didn't quite betray her impatience.<br><br>"Awwwwwww, I used that set just for you!"<br><br>"Please."<br><br>"Man, I don't understand. This shit is way cool. It's fuckin' magic! How are you so bored at it?"<br><br>"We see this stuff every day."<br><br>"Still cool, dude."<br><br>"Yes, it is. Now use your cool powers to seal this place up."<br><br>"They see me rollin', they hatin," he started singing. Another fractal twisted into shape on his left sleeve, and soon after a sound akin to a synthesizer resonated from no where in particular.<br><br>Julia closed her eyes and rubbed her temples. Beatboxing would be better than this. It was like talking to a child, except the child was in his mid twenties, studied and excelled at a powerful branch of magic with special attention to control and containment, and was paid substantially more than psychiatrists to detain and guard Powered inmates. The doctor groaned and looked for a seat.</div></div>

An easy tempo, as though the owner was not hastening down the corridor but taking it at his own pace. A slight clinking of glass and whirling of keys followed quickly. The keys in question were not the keys to the cell. The owner was simply seeking to antagonise the detainee.<br><br>Jacob Marshall looked like he belonged in the wild west. His tan fedora was perched over his dirty blonde, messy hair at such an angle that it was difficult to see his eyes, and his fairly short poncho, connected at the front by a brooch, bulked out a little around the shoulders. His jeans were tucked into shin-high, brown cowboy boots with the trademark spiked wheels on the back. On one side of his ornately buckled belt, an empty gun holster sat, while a hip flask sat on the other hip. As he approached the cell, he whirled the keys around his finger and chewed on the toothpick in his mouth.<br><br>He tapped on the bars of the cell.<br><br>"Howdy, pardner," he greeted, with a slightly smug tone to his voice. The inhabitant of the cell turned his head.<br><br>"Jacob Marshall," Antonio replied coolly. He idly checked his fingernails again, apparently deciding that Jacob was not worth looking at.<br><br>"Knew you'd slip up sooner or later," Marshall taunted. "What were yeh tryin' to steal this time, 'Tonio?"<br><br>"A police officer's dignity," Antonio answered. "Unfortunately, I'm being help for a crime I did not commit.

"Poor Williams nearly lost his badge again for that display.

"Yeh talk like a classy saint, like some camp Robin Hood, but yeh still only got yer own interests at heart."<br><br>"I am a thief, what do you expect, Marshall?" Antonio replied, his voice chilling over.<br><br>"An' I'm a detective.

"I guess it doesn't matter, as long as it gets analyzed."<br><br>"You have a theory, don't you?" Illiana asked, turning her attention to the bed. She kneeled down next to it and lifted the duvet to peer underneath it. As she expected, there were a multitude of boxes.<br><br>"I do, but I'm not gonna bet on it. It doesn't exactly help to make an assumption, just in case it turns out to be wrong and we've based the entire case on it," Yoshimitsu said, leaning against a bare patch of wall.<br><br>Illiana pulled out one of the boxes and removed the lid, placing it lightly on the floor next to her. A bunch of papers filled the plastic. She picked one out at random and glanced over what it said.<br><br><hr><font face="courier"><br>1080HD Television		$1800<br>Blu-ray player			$500<br>Kingsize bed			$400<br>Oak Wardrobe x2			$300<br>Bedside dresser x2		$150<br><br>		Total<br>				$3150</font><br><hr><br><br>"Pricey list," Illiana commented, showing the receipt to Yoshimitsu.<br><br>"Expensive tastes, probably," Yoshimitsu agreed, giving the list a once over. "I wonder how big that TV is..."<br><br>"Is it really important?" Illiana asked, rummaging through the papers again.<br><br>"Probably not. Let's keep looking," Yoshimitsu said, sitting next to Illiana and pulling out a second box.<br><br>As far as she could see, there was nothing immediately suspicious about the contents of the box she was searching through. Plenty of receipts, a few birthday cards, some old school certificates that Henry must have gotten when he was still in school. She pulled out a christmas card and glanced through what was written. Standard christmas greeting, nothing exciting. She continued searching, with a glance to Yoshimitsu's box. More papers. <br><br>"The Odios like to keep records, don't they?" Illiana commented. Yoshimitsu laughed.<br><br>Near the bottom of the box, Illiana found a plain brown envelope with the house address on it. Curious, she opened it and glanced at the letter inside. The sender was what made her read the entire letter through.<br><br><hr><font face="papyrus"><br>	Dear Larry<br><br>	I got the details of what you want to do, but this time I'm worried you're going too far.

Let it go.<br>	<br>	Charles</font><hr><br><br>"Hey Yoshimitsu, take a look at this," Illiana requested, handing him the letter. She waited patiently while he read it.<br><br>"Interesting... But I'm not sure. It's not conclusive of anything," Yoshimitsu replied. "There's no details here, so we don't know what was being talked about. We'd have to ask Dacten himself."<br><br>"Can we do that?" Illiana asked, her expression changing to a more thoughtful one.<br><br>"Probably. He may or may not be linked to this case, but this is suspicious enough. We can ask Williams," Yoshimitsu suggested.<br><br>"Sure, but let's make sure we've got all the evidence we need from here," Illiana concluded. She resumed checking the paper in the box.</div></div>

Elliot, I tried to keep the wording neutral, but tell me if anything should be changed.</i></div><br><br>"Commissioner, take a look at this. It might be relevant, too. Can you verify the writing?"<br><br>The man standing in the doorway to the bedroom found that his hand almost imperceptibly flinched as it reached out to accept this next artifact from Mr. Yoshimitsu -- but Exhibit B was neither blue nor glowing nor unmarked. The plain brown envelope and plain white letter felt exactly like any other in his fingers. Williams read the envelope first. Addressed to Larry Odio from Dacten, dated six days ago. Hadn't the invitation from Antonio Sharpe to meet at Felice Potabile arrived at the Williams residence that same day? No, that'd been the day before, a week ago.<br><br>Williams read the short letter very quickly. Then he frowned and read it slowly. Then he read it slowly again.<br><br>As he read it for the third time, he took stock of Lawrence Odio once again in his mind. A good man. An honest man. A hard worker. Fine cop. Always carried himself well. Loved his wife and son. If not a close friend to Williams, that was simply the result of a polite professional distance, not through any fault whatsoever of Odio's. The Commissioner had always seen this man as the salt of the earth.<br><br>So what for Christ's sake had he been <i>up</i> to?<br><br><i>Years?</i> Larry Odio had been able to keep this secret from the Winstone Police Department for at least three or four years? And Dacten, too? Charles Dacten had been his collaborator... They'd "done what they could" together... but some new direction had put Dacten off... It was true, actually. From what Williams could remember of the past week or so, he hadn't seen Larry and Charlie palling around in the station at all, and that'd made it a rare week for sure. Actually, only four or five days ago, Williams could remember seeing Odio and Dacten pass each other in the hall without a single word. Dacten had obviously been trying to catch Odio's eye, but Odio had marched on ahead without a glance...<br><br>Was this Dacten's only letter to Odio? It seemed the defense team hadn't turned up anything else from him. Forensic experts weren't generally an old-fashioned enough type to bother with snail mail. The two had probably corresponded by phone or email, the past few years. That would have been how Odio had shared "the details of what he wanted to do" -- a message on Dacten's machine or in his inbox -- and when Dacten had tried to protest using either or both of those methods, Odio must have ignored him. Maybe Dacten had hoped that a series of conventional letters in the mail would have garnered Ellen's attention. Maybe even that she would have torn one open and read it for herself.<br><br>But all of this was secondary to the main question: what for Jesus Christ's sake had Odio been up to? What did he "want to achieve" that might have "hurt" people if he'd "gone too far"? Larry Odio had never struck the Commissioner as a violent or hateful man. Sure, he'd seemed to harbor a bit of an anti tendency -- he'd advocated Mildred Hooper just as Williams did, and had complained just as Williams had whenever Bartholomew Staudt let a potential Power convict off the hook -- but was <i>Williams</i> part of some bloodthirsty anti conspiracy out to exterminate every Power within their reach? There were other parties who could "take over" for Odio and Dacten -- who?<br><br><i>And what's the vial got to do with it?</i><br><br>This last thought surprised him, but shouldn't have. He imagined Silna and Mr. Yoshimitsu had probably already made the connection. The vial was no trinket -- Williams could tell that as well as any Power could. Whatever it was, it could very easily have been intended as an instrument in some shadowy plan. Saeptum's analysis would hopefully shed some insight as far as that went.<br><br>Analysis.<br><br>Oh, right. <i>Handwriting</i> analysis. He'd forgotten that Mr. Yoshimitsu had asked him a question.<br><br>"Looks relevant, all right," he observed. "Yes, we can test this to ensure it really is from Dacten..."<br><br>He strained to remember Dacten's handwriting, but he'd only ever seen the man's signature on reports, not longhand script like this. The line work was generic enough that forgery wasn't out of the question, though he had no idea how and why anyone could have forged this. No, in all likelihood it had come from Dacten himself. For the first time since his initial readthrough of the letter, a thought which had been pushing up through Commissioner Williams' subconscious finally found room to surface: Charles Dacten had some explaining to do.<br><br>"You'll want to talk to him, I assume," he muttered, slipping the letter back into the envelope and placing it in his other pocket.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Yoshimitsu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"If that's feasible," Illiana answered, nodding. She glanced at the letter in Williams' hand. Something was amiss here. These two pieces of evidence were suspicious, but currently not incriminating against anyone. Highly unusual, as well. Why on Earth would the father of a clearly Power-fearing family be in posession of something so blatantly magical? <br><br>More to the point, what was the letter about? If Dacten was a close family friend, why would he have sent a letter like that? Why a letter, for one? There must have been better ways. Even talking while at work would have been easier... Unless it was something they'd get in trouble for. But then, if that was the case, what was the letter alluding to? Dacten must have known that Odio would get in trouble, which would explain why the letter was so deliberately vague. Yoshimitsu appeared at her side, interrupting her thoughts.<br><br>"I checked the boxes. There's nothing else there worth commenting on," he confirmed. "No more letters from Mr. Dacten, sort-of sad to say."<br><br>"Sort-of?"<br><br>"Well, I'm sad there's no more evidence but relieved that there was nothing else incriminating the police force," Yoshimitsu explained. "You read the report on Odio, he was a good officer. The force doesn't need to lose anyone else today."<br><br>Illiana nodded, noting the slightly forced aspect of Yoshimitsu's explanation. He was really trying, at least while he was here, not to offend anyone. She appreciated that.<br><br>"I guess this means there's no more evidence here," Illiana concluded. She turned her attention back to Williams. "... I don't think I'm going to question Mrs. Odio right now. Unless there's a really pressing need to, I want to avoid that where possible. Can you tell us where Mr. Dacten works?"</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Beelzebibble</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Williams clicked to attention at this last question. "Of course," he said at once. "He works at the station. I don't know if he's in today, but we'll see about that." Closest to the bedroom door, he led the way out into the hall and began dialing the station as he trooped down the carpeted stairs. Landsvale and the Odios had resumed seats in the living room.<br><br>"...subsidize your tuition, obviously. Not like the government's gonna leave you two out in the..." The Inspector fell silent as the three from upstairs reappeared.<br><br>The call went through. "Yes, Commissioner?"<br><br>"We're coming back to the station, Mrs. Eschholz," Williams told the phone in a clear, crisp voice. He straightened up and pressed one elbow against the doorframe from the living room into the front hall. He felt better already. "First thing I'd like to know is whether Dacten's in today."<br><br>"Yes, I think so. As far as I'm aware, he should be in his office. He might have gone to lunch by now, though. I can try transferring you to him if you'd like..."<br><br>"That's all right, we'll stop by in person." <i>Can't hang up on us that way</i>, Williams privately added. "Also, the defense team has uncovered two pieces of potential evidence at the Odio residence which we'll be bringing in." Landsvale and the Odios visibly perked up at this. "One is a possibly supernatural artifact which I'll need tested, so please call the Foundation's PR desk and ask them to get in touch with me before--"<br><br>"The Foundation? Oh -- Commissioner!" Mrs. Eschholz got through. She sounded very excited. "The Penitentiary sent word that a pair of Foundation representatives arrived there around noon. Reinforcing the Special Confinement blocks, you know. If you head straight there, I bet you could catch them!"<br><br>Williams' eyes widened; he hesitated. The others in the living room were looking at him expectantly. He could feel the shampoo bottle pressing in on his waist in one pocket, the brown envelope jutting slightly out of the other. There was no telling how long the forensic expert's and the agents' locations would be accounted for -- either could slip away within the hour or so it'd take to visit them each in turn. It was time to decide: Saeptum or Dacten?<br><br>"All right, this is what we'll do," he said, ostensibly to Mrs. Eschholz but loud enough for everyone to hear. "I'll drive to the penitentiary myself and find the Foundation reps. Inspector Landsvale and the defense team will head back to the station and meet with Dacten. Mrs. Eschholz, the defense attorney is a young woman named Illiana Silna. Her co-counsel you might have already met... Mr. Yoshimitsu..."<br><br>"Oh yes, he came in to file his papers this morning," Mrs. Eschholz confirmed, before adding in a hushed voice: "Strange boy, isn't he? No hint of a first name, and that <i>hair</i>--"<br><br>"Yes, yes--"<br><br>"You don't think he's a--"<br><br>"Great, Mrs. Eschholz, thank you," Williams interrupted. "Do me a favor and call the Foundation PR anyway, will you, just in case I miss them. That's it for the moment. Thanks very much and I'll be in touch again soon."<br><br>He hung up. Landsvale stood to join him. "'M I hitching a ride with them?" he muttered.<br><br>"If you don't mind." Williams pulled the envelope out of his pocket. "They could use you more than I could for this. Dacten knows a few things he hasn't shared with us," he added when Landsvale noticed the return address. "They'll explain. But -- hey -- listen." For the Inspector had nodded and looked toward Ms. Silna and Mr. Yoshimitsu. Williams gave him a hard stare. "Don't take no for an answer from Dacten, Landsvale. I mean it. He's not gonna talk to these kids by themselves. Don't let him push you away."<br><br>Landsvale returned the stare with his tired smile.<br><br>"Kick the door down if I have to," he said wryly.<br><br>"Good man." The Commissioner moved to give him the plain brown envelope, then thought better of it. He stepped over to Ms. Silna instead, the hard stare not at all diminished. "You found this," he said, "so I'm going to leave it in your hands for the moment. I guess that's only fair. My advice is don't go waving it in Dacten's face right away. See what you can find out from him cold first. Then if you feel there's a good moment, yeah, show it to him. I want to know what he's got to say about it."<br><br>"All right. Thank you very much," Ms. Silna said, and reached out for the envelope, but Williams didn't hand it to her right away.<br><br>"Another thing," he added, and he was conscious of his own voice having dropped in tone. "Dacten may admit to having written the letter. Or he might deny it, and that could be the truth or it could be a lie. But listen to me. No matter what: <i>Do not leave the letter with him</i>. That's not advice, that is an order. If he says he didn't write it, well, obviously our boys'll need to run a handwriting analysis and see what they find. But even if he <i>owns up</i> to it, that letter's evidence and it's got to go straight to the court. So you tell Dacten <i>whatever you need to</i> to walk out of his office with the letter still in your hand, and then you leave it with Landsvale. Do you understand?"<br><br>Ms. Silna swallowed, but her voice was firm as she responded, reassured by a smile from Mr. Yoshimitsu. "I understand, Commissioner."<br><br>"Fine." He held out the envelope to her. "I'm trusting you with this. I think you've earned it. Don't prove me wrong."<br><br>She took it. <br><br>"I won't, sir. I promise."<br><br>Mr. Yoshimitsu piped up. "Off we go, then?"<br><br>"Yeah, I think so," said Ms. Silna, but she didn't sweep out the door right away. First she approached the Odios on the couch. "Mrs. Odio -- Henry -- thank you so much for your cooperation. We're really sorry for intr--"<br><br>"What does the letter say?" <br><br>Mrs. Odio had snapped this, taking Williams aback with the tone of her voice. Whatever Landsvale'd accomplished to cheer her up while they'd been upstairs, her face was reddening again. Ms. Silna shrank away slightly, and even Mr. Yoshimitsu's eyebrows rose. The mother rose off the couch, followed by her son. "Did Charles write it? Lawrence never showed me any letter from Charles -- What did he <i>say?</i> Why are you taking that? <i>What else are you taking?</i>"<br><br>"I..." Ms. Silna began, but she was faltering badly. "It's... He said that..."<br><br>Williams stepped in. Feel though he might for Ellen Odio, they'd be held up here for another hour if they tried breaking the news to her now. "I'm going to call you later this afternoon, all right, Ellen?" he asked, a little too forcibly, maybe. "And then I'm going to give you a full description of the two items we're taking to court. You deserve to know, but there's just not enough time right now. Is that okay? Ellen. Okay?"<br><br>For she was still staring at Ms. Silna, eyes bright and teeth gritted.<br><br>But then her face cleared. <br><br>"I guess that's all right," she said distantly. "Yes... Yes, give me a call, won't you, Perry?" A bleary smile reached Ms. Silna and Mr. Yoshimitsu. "Well, then," she managed, "you'd better run along, isn't that right? No rest for the... For the..."<br><br>Henry hurried forward and shook hands once more. "Nice meeting you," he told Ms. Silna and Mr. Yoshimitsu under his breath. The apologetic look had surfaced in his features again, no more justified than it had been earlier. "You too, Inspector," he added, shaking Landsvale's hand as well.<br><br>"Yeah," said Landsvale slowly. "Take care."<br><br>It was Mr. Yoshimitsu who broke the circle first. After a nod in Williams' direction, he rather awkwardly sauntered out into the hall and then out the front door. Landsvale followed him after a brief salute to Williams and a gentle wave to the Odios. Ms. Silna lingered the longest, blushing, probably still hurt and anxious after Mrs. Odio's outburst, her mouth open and on the edge of speech. When the sound of the visitors' car starting came in from outside, the spell broke: She murmured, "Well -- thanks again," directed somewhere in between Williams and the Odios, apparently so that all three of them would receive it, and then hurried out of the house, careful (judging by Williams' ears) not to let the screen door slam behind her.<br><br>Which left him with the mother and son in the living room.<br><br>"All right, Ellen. I have to take off, too. Like I said, I'll call you." She nodded, and he went on, "And I'll see both of you at the court tomorrow morning, yeah? Should we send along a car to pick you up?"<br><br>Mrs. Odio frowned and shook her head. "I can drive us, it's fine..." But Henry exchanged a glance with Williams and quickly added, "A pickup would be good, I think."<br><br>"Right. I'll let you know the time when I call you back." Williams shook Henry's hand. "You're handling this very well, Henry," he said, and even as fragments from the letter resurfaced in his mind<br><br><hr><font face="Papyrus">You haven't considered just who you will be hurting<hr><hr>this is not what you should be doing.</font><hr><br>he was able to add, "He'd've been proud of you."<br><br>Then he took the mother's colder hand. "Stay strong, Ellen," he told her. "Whoever's to blame, we're going to bring them to justice." <i>And I'm going to make goddamned sure your husband still has a lick of honor to his name when we're through,</i> he did not add.<br><br>She released his hand when he pulled away, but she was gazing at him very intently. The dreamy look had dissipated.<br><br>"Perry," she said.<br><br>"Yes?"<br><br>"That girl... Do you know who she reminded me of? She reminded me of Bette Garrett."<br><br>"Who's that?" Henry asked, kindly sparing Williams the admission that he had no idea either.<br><br>"The <i>dearest</i> girl... She was in my class at grade school. That was back in the U.S., you know, and you didn't meet too many Powers there and then... But Bette was a Power. She had pre- -- oh, what do you call it, pre- something beginning with H--"<br><br>"Prehensile?" Williams offered.<br><br>"That's it. <i>Prehensile</i>. Prehensile hair. She could make it form all these shapes -- twists and curls and spirals and whatever she felt like..." She paused to recollect. Williams stole a glance down at his watch, imagining the Foundation agents disappearing off back through whatever wormhole in space they'd probably taken to get to the Penitentiary. "Some of the kids hated her, but my friends and I liked her. We always... We always reached <i>out</i> to Bette. We never avoided her, or bullied her, or -- or forced her to do tricks when she didn't want to, like a circus animal..."<br><br>"What happened?" asked Henry, but to Williams' minor relief, Mrs. Odio changed gears with her next words.<br><br>"I'm sorry, Perry, I'm keeping you -- what I mean to say is... I've <i>heard</i> things," and now she was speaking in a barely audible hush. "I've heard people saying that..." She took a deep breath. "That it might come down to war. That the Powers might just decide to take the whole Archipelago over for their own. They wouldn't even need guns or missiles, would they, they could wipe us out if they really wanted to... just blow us off the map if they really... But I think about Bette Garrett, and I look at <i>that</i> girl, and I don't want to believe they would do that. I want to believe they like us, and they wouldn't hurt us. But then...<br><br>"What do <i>you</i> believe, Perry?"<br><br>A blood-smeared restaurant; a flaming hotel; an apartment building reduced to frozen rubble. All in under a week. That was when the word "terrorists" had started circulating a lot more rapidly among the walls of Winstone City.<br><br>"Who have you heard saying such things?" Williams asked.<br><br>"Just people..." she mumbled.<br><br>But he didn't let up. A horrible idea had formed. "Ellen, did <i>he</i> ever tell you anything like that?"<br><br>Henry looked blank, helpless. Henry was away at college most of the year and did not hear most of the things his father said. But Mrs. Odio, her eyes glistening, on the verge of tears again, nodded.<br><br>Williams gazed at her for another moment, the watch forgotten.<br><br>"Ellen," he said, very cautiously, "one Power, two Powers, they go rogue, they can do a lot of damage. But try to get all the Powers in the Archipelago to agree on a place for <i>dinner</i> and see how far you get."<br><br><i>"...will commence this Saturday in the historic city of Shin-Ra. A celebration of magical culture to which all are invited. Whether you're a wizened thaumaturge or have never cast a spell, we can promise you'll be dazzled by..."</i><br><br>He mentally punched the power button on the remote control, and the memory of the commercial fizzled out to black.<br><br>"Will they be a threat? Yes. Always. Not all of them, sure, but enough that the nice ones will never be able to fully answer for their kind. But <i>war?</i> No, Ellen. They're not that coordinated. They'll never be able to bring that much force against us at one time. To be brutally frank," he lied, "I'd be more worried about the Giarrettieras taking over Winstone -- even after the Ansonia incident! -- than about Powers conquering the entire country.<br><br>"Now I really have to be going," he announced, before Mrs. Odio could protest further. "But if it will make you feel safer, I'll send another couple of my officers along to guard the house. They can stay as long as you feel you need them -- overnight, even, and then just drive you up in the morning. Will that help?"<br><br>"That'd be a huge help," Henry said gratefully.<br><br>"Of course. Good. Well. I'm going to call you again once I get the chance, right, Ellen?" She nodded. She seemed to be drifting away again. Henry stood up to show Williams to the door. "Thank you so much, Commissioner," he began, but -- "I'm Perry to you too, all right, young man?" came the immediate rejoinder.<br><br>In the hall, Henry reached out his hand once again, but Williams, thinking it was probably getting tired of shakes at this point, clapped his own large, thick hand on Henry's shoulder instead. "Be safe," he told the boy. "See you tomorrow."<br><br>Then he swung open the screen door and stepped out again into the bright, dry afternoon. He trudged down the gravel path and got back into the cruiser, alone this time. He slowly rolled it down the hill, off the driveway and onto Pennyroyal Drive.<br><br><i>"I want to believe they like us, and they wouldn't hurt us.<br><br>"But then..."<br><br>Oh I'd like to believe that too I surely would,</i> thought Commissioner Williams before turning on the radio.<br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler5785298').toggle();if($('#spoiler5785298').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler5785298"><i>OOC: Just north of 14,000 characters and only two days after my last RP post.

        <h2 class="poster">Yoshimitsu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"What's up, Illiana?" Yoshimitsu asked as Illiana paused at the side of the car, a worried, yet thoughtful expression on her face. Her frown looked slightly out of place, ruining the picture of a teenage girl who, for all the world, looked like she could be out partying every night.<br><br>"This case... I have a nasty feeling that something's going to go wrong in the trial tomorrow," Illiana admitted. She was about to step to the passenger seat, then thought better and allowed Landsvale that seat. The three slipped into Yoshimitsu's car. "When did you get a car, anyway?"<br><br>"A while ago, but I barely use it," Yoshimitsu admitted, adjusting the central mirror and checkin the view out of the wing-mirrors. "And you're probably right. There's not nearly enough evidence to name the true culprit yet. I don't have any clue who it is."<br><br>"Me neither, but this Dacten guy's looking a bit suspicious," Illiana commented.<br><br>"Mind if I ask... the letter," Landsvale said, glancing backwards to the green haired girl. She passed it forward for Landsvale to read. Like Williams, he read it three times before handing it back without comment.<br><br>"Could you tell us a bit about Mr. Dacten?" Yoshimitsu asked, pulling off the drive. He was being a bit more careful driving with Landsvale in the car. "What does he do?"<br><br>"Forensic expert, spent a lot of time at crime scenes," Landsvale explained briefly. "Good friend of the Odios. He's staying off this case for just that reason. Word from the higher-ups, you know. Don't want to see emotions getting in the way of professionalism."<br><br>"I see..."<br><br>"Maybe <i>too</i> close a friend..." Illiana commented.<br><br>~*~*~1PM, Criminal Affairs Department, Winstone~*~*~<br><br>"Y'know,  I never thought being a lawyer would involve this much... leg work," Illiana commented, passing through the automatic doors of the entrance. She stepped up to the desk, fiddling with the shiny defense attorney badge pinned to her t-shirt. "I thought it was all court cases and nothing else."<br><br>"Well, the evidence has to come from somewhere, right?" Yoshimitsu said thoughtfully, stepping up beside her.<br><br>"I guess so. I think we found everything worth finding from the Odio's house," Illiana agreed. Landsvale stepped away from the pair and towards one of the numerous doors leading out of the entrance hall, indicating that Illiana and Yoshimitsu should follow.<br><br>The sliding doors opened again. Illiana turned her head to see a very unusual sight. A cowboy wandering into the Criminal Affairs Department? Now she was sure she'd seen everything. The cowboy wandered up to the desk behind the pair. His blue eyes flickered down to the badge on Illiana's t-shirt. After a moment of silence, he extended his hand.<br><br>"Howdy, Miss Attorney," he greeted. "Detective Jacob Marshall, at yer service."<br><br>"Jacob Marshall?" Yoshimitsu asked, looking at the man. Jacob shook Illiana's hand, then extended his hand again to Yoshimitsu. A brief shake. "Yoshimitsu. Pleasure."<br><br>"Illiana," Illiana said. She looked at him for a moment, wondering whether or not she should question the outfit. Before she could make up her mind, he spoke again.<br><br>"Defendin' 'Tonio, are yeh?" He asked, pulling a razor from his pocket. He sliced through some of the stubble on one side of his chin, then the other. This time it was Illiana's turn to raise her eyebrow. Scare tactics?<br><br>"I am. Do you know him?" Illiana asked.<br><br>"In a manner of speakin', yeah," Marshall confirmed, rubbing his hand over his chin to check how even his impromptu shave was. "I was just over there talkin' to the kid. Big fan of his, me."<br><br>"Oh really?"<br><br>"Naw, not really, heh. He landed me in a bit of trouble a while back," Marshall stated with a neutral expression on his face. Illiana looked at him, trying to measure him up. "How come he asked you to defend him anyway?"<br><br>"Because he trusts me."<br><br>"And do you trust him?"<br><br>"Of course," Illiana replied instantly. While not stricty true, she at least trusted that he hadn't committed the murder.<br><br>There was a moment when Illiana knew something was off. Weren't his eyes blue a second ago? For just a second there, she could have sworn they'd flashed yellow. Just for a second... Maybe it was just a trick of the light. She glanced at Yoshimitsu, but he had a tense expression. Marshall laughed at some unknown joke.<br><br>"So does Staudt apparently," Marshall continued. "Just saw 'im at the penitentiary. Offered 'Tonio a plea bargin. Kid declined it."<br><br>"What makes you think Antonio is even related to this case, outside of coincidence?" Illiana asked, a hint of defiance in her voice. She could tell already that there was some serious bad blood between this detective and Antonio.<br><br>"'Cause it's got his fingerprints all over it, Miss Attorney," Marshall responded. "Anyway, I've got business to attend to. If you'll excuse me, pardner."<br><br>As Marshall walked off, Yoshimitsu clicked his tongue.<br><br>"Some day I'll find out what his powers are," Yoshimitsu said.<br><br>"Marshall's a power?" Illiana asked. The pair followed Landsvale through one of the many doors, Landsvale running an ID card through each lock. <br><br>"I think so," Yoshimitsu answered. "Him and Antonio had a few run-ins a while back, that's what tipped me off." Before Illiana could question further, Yoshimitsu glanced significantly at Landsvale. Illiana kept her mouth closed about their 'friend'. It'd do absolutely nothing for their case if Landsvale heard them talk about The Butterfly instead of just Antonio, apart from maybe make it blow up in their faces.<br><br>"'Round here..." Landsvale said before stopping in front of a door. The plaque bore Dacten's name and title. He rapped his knuckles on the door three times. A few seconds later, the door opened and a man stood in the gap.<br><br>He was nearly identical to the man in the painting hanging in Mrs. Odio's bedroom. Greying hair, thin, slightly more wrinkled. His attire was slightly less formal too, his tie pulled looser, his jacket abandoned and his shirt untucked. He looked at Landsvale expectantly, but his pupils narrowed when he laid eyes on Illiana.<br><br>"This is Illiana Silna, just appointed the attorney on the Odio case," Landsvale repeated. "And her co-counsel, Yoshimitsu."<br><br>"Hello Mr. Dacten," Illiana greeted carefully. "We've come to ask you a few questions."<br><br>"Yes, well..." Dacten started, clearly looking for a way out of the situation. His eyes kept on flickering back to Illiana's hair. "I'm... er, rather busy... at the moment."<br><br>"We wont be long," Illiana persisted. "The Commissioner told us where your office is, and asked Detective Landsvale to accompany us here."<br><br>Dacten looked to Landsvale for some contradiction, but the detective just nodded. <br><br>"Mr. Dacten," Yoshimitsu chipped in. "All we require is fifteen minutes of your time. After that, we'll be out of your hair."<br><br>"I... that is..." Dacten stuttered, still flustered. "I... okay, just fifteen minutes. I have a mountain of paperwork to be filed."<br><br>"Thank you," Illiana said.<br><br>Dacten held the door open for the trio to enter. There were two chairs in the room, one on either side of the desk which was covered in papers. A laptop sat open, facing the far wall. Illiana let her eyes move around, examining every detail. A board with a number of pictures of crime scenes, drawings and typed papers pinned to it, with a slightly smaller one next to it with pictures of Dacten and the Odios. Behind the desk, a few certificates hung on the walls. A window with a view of the road was on the final empty wall. <br><br>Dacten closed the door behind him, and took his seat. Illiana hesitated, but quickly sat in the seat opposite him. With Yoshimitsu and Landsvale behind her, she decided, she still had the psychological upper-hand. <br><br>"Mr. Dacten, can I ask you a few questions about Larry Odio?" Illiana asked.<br><br>"Lawrence," Dacten corrected. "He preferred Lawrence."<br><br>"Sorry," Illiana said quickly. "But Mr. Dacten..."<br><br>"Yes yes, of course."<br><br>"Thank you. I was wondering if you might tell us about your relationship with the Odio family?" <br><br>"The Odios... Good family. I was close friends with Lawrence," Dacten explained briefly. "He and Ellen named me godfather to Henry. Biggest honor of my life, really. We vacationed together often. Lawrence was like a brother to me."<br><br>"I see... And how long have you and Lawrence been friends for?" Illiana asked.<br><br>"Six, seven years now?" Dacten answered, scratching the back of his head in thought. He closed his laptop lid, then crossed his fingers and rested them on top of his desk. "Met him during orientation, we got to talking, went for a few drinks."<br><br>Behind her, Illiana registered Yoshimitsu moving around. As soon as she did, Dacten's eyes darted to the boy, then back to Illiana. <br><br>"And you haven't had any arguments in that time?"<br><br>"One or two, but that's normal," Dacten said dismissively. He answered the question very quickly, Illiana noticed. "Any fights we had were fixed by a few pints down the pub."<br><br>"Have you had any arguments this past week?" Illiana asked. Dacten visibly paled.<br><br>"N-no, we've just been busy," Dacten argued. Yoshimitsu laughed. He appeared in Illiana's sight for a split second, then vanished again. He must have seen something on the desk, and moved too fast to be caught. She'd ask him later. For now, Illiana stood up and walked around to the back of the chair. She produced the envelope from her pocket, slipping the sheet of paper out. She read out a section.<br><br><hr><font face="papyrus">I got the details of what you want to do, but this time I'm worried you're going too far. I understand what you want to achieve, but this is not the way to do it. You haven't considered just who you will be hurting.<br>I'm your friend, so I have to tell you that this is not what you should be doing.</font><hr><br><br>There was a moment of silence following her words. On one side, Landsvale stood watching the action. On the other, Yoshimitsu wore his lop-sided, lazy grin. Dacten stared at Illiana for a second, his eyes strangely unfocused as though he was staring through her instead of at her.<br><br>"I... didn't write that," Dacten argued, though his tone wasn't convincing anyone. <br><br>"I guess that's possible," Illiana admitted. "Detective, can we have the handwriting on this analyzed, please?"<br><br>"'Ll get right on it," Landsvale murmured, extending his hand for the letter. <br><br>At that moment, Dacten threw himself across the desk and lunged at Illiana. In a flash of blue, the entire scene changed. Yoshimitsu had Dacten, arm twisted around his back and pressed against the desk. Landsvale and Illiana both stared. It wasn't what Illiana had been expecting, to be assaulted in a police building. Live and learn, she figured. Yoshimitsu had his hand placed right in between Dacten's shoulder blades.<br><br>"I can't wait to see you in court, Dacten," Yoshimitsu said, and for once Illiana heard a hint of anger in his voice.<br><br>"Detective, can you call for some support?" Illiana asked quickly. Landsvale blinked, then registered what Illiana had asked. He was immediately on the phone.<br><br>"You don't wanna talk to us? Sure. We'll drag it out of you in court tomorrow," Yoshimitsu stated. "But keep your hands off my friends. I don't know what you and Odio were up to, but you can bet we'll find out."<br><br>"Yoshimitsu, that's enough," Illiana said loudly and forcefully. Yoshimitsu paused, glancing back at the summoner. He nodded. Landsvale ended the call for back-up, and produced some handcuffs. With Yoshimitsu's help, Dacten was cuffed and forced into his seat again.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Beelzebibble</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Denham."<br><br>Inspector Landsvale worked quickly, pressing first the bow of the left cuff against Dacten's left wrist, then the right. He double-locked the cuffs, allowing Dacten's hands to hang uselessly knuckles-to-knuckles in his lap, and then firmly pushed the forensic expert down into his chair by the shoulders. He did all this without looking up, using the busywork as an excuse to pretend to ignore Dacten. When the man spoke again, however, he relented.<br><br>"Denham," insisted Dacten. "Think about this. You can't really suspect me of...?"<br><br>"Of what? Of murder?" Landsvale asked softly. "Nope. Course not. Unless you're about to pull a Staudt on us." He considered reminding Dacten that only a Power could have escaped Felice Potabile without running directly into the police, but decided against; he was concerned Dacten would take it as an insult to his intelligence. He straightened up over Dacten's seat. "Attempted assault on the defense attorney at least warrants you a time-out, though."<br><br>"I was just grabbing for the letter, for God's sake! I wasn't going to lay a hand on her--"<br><br>"Uh-huh." Landsvale tucked the plain brown envelope into the pocket of his pants.<br><br>Dacten raised his linked hands, fingers splayed -- <i>Please sah I want some moh,</i> Landsvale thought nonsensically. "Listen, I lost it for a minute, I see that, and I apologize -- but can't you at least give me the letter? If someone's forging my handwriting, I want to figure out who. Don't I deserve that much?"<br><br>Landsvale shook his head. "Sorry. It's evidence. Boys downstairs'll need to analyze it."<br><br>"And get their pizza-greasy fingers all over it? We'll be lucky if we can <i>read</i> it tomorrow. I've seen the pawprints that come out of that room, what do you think I'm paid to notice?" Dacten leaned forward without trying to rise from his chair. "Come on, Denham. <i>Please.</i>"<br><br>The Inspector made the mistake of meeting the forensic expert's distraught eyes. At first he didn't say anything. It was only after a moment that he was able to look down.<br><br>"'M sorry, Charlie."<br><br>From Dacten there came a quiet grunt.<br><br>"I get it. You're siding with them." He rested his head against the chair back and looked up at the ceiling. "Never thought I'd live to see a fellow on the force taking orders from a couple of kids with unnatural hair."<br><br>"Kinda like the blue, actually," Landsvale replied with a smile, before Ms. Silna or Yoshimitsu had time to protest. "Could do without the green, I guess, but what's it matter really, huh? You know they could be KKK members and that'd have nothing to do with helpin' us put Larry to rest--"<br><br>"<i>Lawrence</i>," the other man pressed.<br><br>"See, all right, now what's with this?"<br><br>"Lawrence: that was his proper name."<br><br>"His <i>wife</i> called him Lawrence. To you and me, he was Larry. Why so formal allova sudden?"<br><br>Charlie Dacten gave him a hurt glare.<br><br>"I'm just trying to honor the dead," he muttered, "which is more than can be said for you, Denham, bringing these kids into my office and waving some forged letter around, trying to make him look like a sociopath..."<br><br>"I feel he would've preferred you thinking about him the way you always did," said Landsvale slowly and deliberately. "Unless, of course, you <i>don't</i> think the same of him these days as you used to, which would be different, obviously."<br><br>There was a small silence. Immediately he regretted saying this. He'd gone too far. Dacten sat stonily, looking as if Landsvale had just struck him in the face. Landsvale would have apologized on the spot except that the backup unit arrived just then with much fuss and clamor and pretty soon he perceived that the moment was gone.<br><br>* * *<br><br>The enormous concrete walls of Winstone Penitentiary, home of all Johto's finest depraved criminals (<i>no, not all,</i> Williams thought grimly, <i>never all</i>) stood to attention on the far outskirts of town. The Penitentiary would have been hard to spot on the horizon, being the same iron color as the mountains beyond it, if not for its rigid, angular design -- perfect, and so of course, wholly artificial. The Commissioner wasn't so far removed  that he would have described the fortress as aesthetically pleasant, but there was all the same a certain wonder in watching the spiked iron gates rumble open to let the police cruiser in: the always-returning feeling that this must be what it was like to enter one of the pyramids.<br><br>"Yes, they're still here," assured the old man in the lobby, whose name Williams kept forgetting -- O'Ferguson or some such. "They'll be down in the Special Confinement blocks, I'm sure. If they miss you I'll have 'em wait back here."<br><br>But they didn't miss Williams, or rather, he didn't miss them. After walking for what felt like twenty minutes through the entire ordinary confinement complex, Williams came upon the featureless gray tunnel which led underground into Special Confinement. He was aware of more direct entrances into this subterranean network of cells, but the potential security breach meant that those entrances were opened only when immediately transporting Power prisoners into or out of the Penitentiary. This was a policy Williams found a lot easier to appreciate when his big black ass was in a leather rolling chair. <br><br>Huffing and puffing, he finally came upon the visitors from the Foundation in block SC-4. The freaky guy in the scarf was there, of course, working his acid-trip magic to reinforce the cells and singing badly out of key to pass the time. And there was an olive-skinned woman in a much more sensible suit whom Williams felt he vaguely recognized. He'd seen her once or twice before, he realized, though it was hard to identify where. She seemed to pass hither and yon without much fanfare. <br><br>He drew a heavy breath. "Trent," he called. "And you, ma'am. I'd like a word."</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Yoshimitsu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Illiana and Yoshimitsu slipped out of the room as the back-up team appeared. Illiana reasoned, somewhat frantically, that she would only be in the way while they apprehended Dacten. Her real reason was that she was somewhat shaken by the sudden attack. In a safe, police environment with an officer and two powers, the last thing she had expected was for an assault. Yoshimitsu had followed her out, and she pretended that the look in his eyes wasn't concern. <br><br>"Thanks for that," she said, aiming for nonchalant. It sounded a bit more pathetic out loud. She was a summoner, for God's sake! She should have been able to handle herself.<br><br>"No problem," Yoshimitsu replied easily, his expression lapsing back into relaxed. There was a still a hint of concern there, though. "Thanks for stopping me before I really lost my temper."<br><br>"No problem," Illiana echoed.<br><br>The two waited in silence for a moment as the police officers left the room. Dacten resisted long enough to glare at the pair before he was forced along. Illiana frowned. Not exactly the most dignified expression in the world, but she couldn't say it was unexpected. After all, they had basically named him a suspect, insofar that he knew about the crime. Still, one thing bothered her.<br><br>"Six or seven years" was how long Dacten had said he'd known Odio; according to him, they'd "met during orientation." It just didn't mesh with the facts. If Odio had been on the force for twenty years, orientation was at least twenty years ago, not six. Was that true? Was he lying to her about that? Wait. That hadn't necessarily been a lie, because "during orientation" was an ambiguous phrase. Dacten might have just meant that <i>he'd</i> been going through orientation six or seven years ago when he'd met Odio, already on the force. Given the response to the letter, though... There was one immediate and easy way to set this straight. Landsvale was walking out of Dacten's office, tucking his cell phone into his pocket and checking the doorknob behind him.<br><br>"Inspector, a moment?" she asked. When he nodded and approached, she asked, "How long has Dacten been on the force?"<br><br>Landsvale frowned and opened his mouth wordlessly. Then he said, "Ah, hell... All honesty, I couldn't tell you." He must have caught Illiana's disappointed look, because he hastily added, "Only been with this department for a few months, you see. Transferred in after the Ansonia mess... I've kinda steered clear of asking people how long they'd been at it. Guess I thought it'd come off a little rude."<br><br>"Is there any chance we could look that up?" Yoshimitsu asked. Illiana noted the slightly knowing tone of his voice: he'd obviously picked up on her train of thought. "That's got to be on file here, his employment record -- right?"<br><br>"Sure, I could look that up in the..." But Landsvale was trailing off. "Wait. Hold on a minute."<br><br>"What is it?" Illiana asked.<br><br>"His godfather... The kid's--" The Inspector's baggy eyes widened. He snapped his fingers. "Charlie Dacten is Henry Odio's godfather!"<br><br>"What? Really?"<br><br>"Positive. Williams mentioned it a while ago, before any of this... 'D never met the kid before today, and I'd forgotten, but I guarantee it's true. Could call Williams for you and let him confirm it, if you want," Landsvale offered.<br><br>"That's all right, I believe you," said Illiana, not wanting to take up more of the Commissioner's time today than she had to. She figured that testimony from someone on the force would be adequate in court, too. Still, this was a crucial piece of information. "Then Dacten can't possibly have been telling the truth about how long he knew Mr. Odio. No family waits until their son's a teenager before naming a godfather. Dacten must have known the Odios for as long as Henry's been alive -- twenty years, at least!"<br><br>"Probably longer," Yoshimitsu guessed, "since Larry wouldn't have named Dacten the godfather if they hadn't already been friends for at least a few years..."<br><br>Illiana beamed. "I knew he was lying about that. I knew it!"<br><br>"But the question remained, why? Why bother trying to lie about it?" asked Yoshimitsu. She recognised that tone. He wasn't challenging her, he was trying to trigger a thoughtful response.<br><br>"In the letter..." she said slowly. "Odio must have run something by Dacten... Maybe it'd end in Odio's death, we don't know yet, but I'm willing to bet on it and Dacten knew! He knew it might be one of the outcomes! So he's trying to worm his way out, saying he wasn't as close to Odio as he really was, so he's been distancing himself to avoid being murdered too!"<br><br>Yoshimitsu cuffed her on the upper arm.<br><br>"Look at <i>you!</i>" he grinned. "I love it. You're really getting the hang of this. Of course, that's assuming Dacten really did write the letter. I mean, the way he reacted, that's practically certain, but we'll still need to get that handwriting analysis."<br><br>Yes, the handwriting analysis, Illiana thought, but the question of forgery wasn't the only thing her hypothesis glossed over... There was still Antonio, in the center of all this. Her client, and she realized with a sudden pang of guilt that she'd barely thought about him at all since meeting Jacob Marshall in the lobby. Perhaps someone had murdered Larry Odio in order to protect whoever his plans would have endangered, and perhaps not, but that didn't change the fact that the murderer had clearly been looking to frame the Butterfly, and Illiana was yet at a loss to find any point where these two motives might have intersected. Would Antonio have been among those threatened by Larry Odio's hazy plans?<br><br>Would Illiana have? And Yoshimitsu?<br><br>"Sure thing," said Inspector Landsvale. "'M taking it downstairs right now. If Dacten wrote it, they won't need more than a few hours to confirm."<br><br>"Thank you very much, Inspector," Illiana told him firmly.<br><br>"Don't mention it," he said. He started off down the hallway toward the elevators. "And thanks for the ride," he added over his shoulder, before a gaggle of officers emerging from one of the elevators drowned him out.<br><br>"What did you find, anyway?" she asked. Yoshimitsu was still staring down the corridor, as though about to shout a question to Landsvale. He snapped back to reality just in time to catch the question.<br><br>"Not sure, yet," he admitted. "It's a letter, and it looks like it's been written in response to the last letter, but it's been typed. There's no way to check where it came from, outside of the return address."<br><br>"What does it say?" Illiana asked.<br><br>"Coward," Yoshimitsu said.<br><br>"Excuse me?" Illiana answered. She sounded slightly offended.<br><br>"That's all it says, look," Yoshimitsu explained quickly, handing her the letter. She slipped it open and pulled out the sheet of paper. Sure enough, right in the middle of the paper.<br><br><hr><font face="courier">Coward</font><hr><br><br>She slipped the letter back into the envelope and checked the address. One address was their current location, and specifically the same office that they had just left. On the reverse, she saw the return address. 28 Pennyroyal Drive, Winstone. There was no way to verify anything, outside of where it had left from and where it had gone to. She sighed, and slipped the letter into her pocket.<br><br>"Guess we've gotta wait around for a bit, then," Yoshimitsu commented. "Wanna go grab lunch?"<br><br>~*~*~ 1:30PM, Demitasse, Winstone ~*~*~<br><br>"Coffee, black, no sugar, please," Marshall requested, handing over a ten dollar bill. The barista nodded, and busied herself with making the coffee.<br><br>Marshall took a moment to glance around the coffee shop. It was nice, quiet. Very few customers this time of day, despite it being the lunch hour rush. Probably something to do with the price, but Marshall was willing to pay extra for decent coffee instead of the watered down rubbish that other places sold. A fuller flavour and richer aroma, at just the right temperature. A few other patrons clearly agreed with him, since it was clear that no one present was intending to rush their drinks.<br><br>"Here you are, Mr. Marshall," the barista said, handing him the cup.<br><br>"Thanks Loraine," Marshall answered. The barista, Loraine, giggled slightly at the use of her name. Marshall was on first name terms with the entire staff, but that wasn't altogether that surprising since he spent a fair bit of time there. He sat in his usual seat, a booth by the window, and relaxed. Time to consider what he knew so far.<br><br>An old friend on the force tipped him off that Antonio had been arrested. One of his few old friends, as it turned out. Apparently, too many people found his tactics dangerous and worrying. Sometimes a few bones needed to be broken, he always figured. As soon as he heard this, he made his way to the penitentiary. A good number of the convicts had been put there by him. Marshall had been a strong member of the force once upon a time, right until that time. That one case that turned everything on its head, and it was all that smart-mouthed brat's fault.<br><br>Marshall, for the longest time, had known about Antonio's other identity. The renowned thief, the Butterfly. That kid had grown up too fast in some ways, and not matured in the ways he needed to. The kid had a taste for crime and the skill to pull it off, not to mention the powers. At the end of the day, though, he was still a kid. Arrogant, shameless and self-assured to a fault. Kid thought he was the absolute on morality, but everything he did was for the greater glory of Antonio.<br><br>It wasn't until that case that Marshall realised just how dangerous a combination that was.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Julia noted the prisoner's bored posture as Barclay twisted another plane of ink through space. This Antonio was not fazed in the slightest by magic or prisons. He even seemed annoyed, as if this were all just a hassle. Kids his age usually showed visual fear or signs that they were hiding fear when incarcerated. Magic, too.<br><br>Barclay eventually let the repeating angles and points settle on the floor after he seemed to finish forming them. There was a brief flash of light connecting the eight fractals, momentarily shaping a box that bordered the prisoner's cell, but just as quickly as it appeared, darkness came back. The doctor's pupils didn't even have time to contract.<br><br>Barclay threw a dangling end of his striped scarf over his neck and turned to give Julia an impeccably white smile. The doctor noticed a small twitch from his right arm as a sparkle manifested at the edge of the man's mouth.<br><br>"That should take care of it! I think."<br><br>"You're the magic specialist here."<br><br>"Well, the old runes have been cleaned off, new ones are in place and shielded, and— Commishie, what's up!" the man turned around completely.<br><br>Julia turned as well to face the out-of-breath, African-American man who was straightening his back, presumably after slouching and/or resting his hands on his knees. His eyes were briefly on her associate, but quickly moved to her. She noted the look on his face. Mild distrust and judgmental thoughts indicated by a scrutinizing semi-glare with an attempt to hide it under a damp, furrowed brow that could easily be misconstrued as a fatigue, though the tell was the commissioner's changing expression. His muscles relaxed, his posture became more rigid, and his eyes stopped scrutinizing so that they could examine the doctor. <br><br>Julia smiled. She never forgot to smile when doing her first check, though nine times out of ten the look was genuine. The one time out of ten usually involved her sessions with Barclay, who she saw moving in her peripheral vision.<br><br>"Mishmash, haven't seen you in a while," Barclay said. He began to step toward the man, hand raised and palm flat. He didn't really expect to high five the man, did he? The doctor fought the urge to bury her face in her palms again. No progress with him.<br><br>Before Barclay could get any closer, Julia took a step toward the man, still smiling, and leaning slightly forward, knowing that her ambiguously aggressive posture would recapture the commissioner's attention, and knowing that her new position would be in the shortest path between her associate and the police officer. She reached a hand toward Williams, which he instinctively reciprocated. "Commissioner Williams, I don't think we've had the pleasure of meeting in person. Julia Romanesco. Let's take our business into the hall while Mr. Trent triple checks the security?"</div></div>

        <h2 class="poster">Yoshimitsu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">~*~*~1:40PM, Demitasse, Winstone~*~*~<br><br>"So let's review," Yoshimitsu declared, as he and Illiana sat at a table in the coffee shop, two fresh cups in front of them. Illiana picked apart the pastry on her plate, debating how hungry she was. <br><br>"Larry Odio was murdered at about eleven last night, by a gunshot to the heart," Illiana  started. "He was found at the Felice Potabile by Commissioner Williams. Antonio's presence and the antics of the Butterfly caused Antonio to be suspected of, at the very least, accomplice to murder."<br><br>"That's the bare bones of the murder itself," Yoshimitsu agreed, sipping his coffee. "What evidence do we have so far?"<br><br>"The letter from Dacten to Odio, the letter from Odio to Dacten, the vial of magic in Odio's bedroom," Illiana listed, consulting her notepad. "The large caliber gun, the lack of blood at the bar. Does Dacten's reaction to the letter count?"<br><br>"Not really, sadly," Yoshimitsu answered. Illiana sipped her coffee, deciding finally that she wasn't hungry. She set her cup down, then pushed the pastry towards Yoshimitsu. He wasted no time in devouring it. <br><br>"You have crumbs on your face," Illiana pointed out, a smile on her lips. "So our best defense right now is that Antonio's not actually connected to the crime, it's just a coincidence."<br><br>"Pretty sure no court will believe that, but it's what we have right now," Yoshimitsu agreed. <br><br>Illiana sighed. Dacten hadn't provided the lead with the case that she had been hoping for. Granted, she wasn't that surprised since the letter implicated that Dacten and Odio had a somewhat shady past which had come to an abrupt end. She was so curious about what the letter was hinting at. What could two police officers have done in the past, and kept secret from even their colleagues for years? There was much more to this case than they were discovering. With what little evidence they had, the trial was looking hopeless.<br><br>"Howdy, Miss Attorney," a voice came. Illiana pulled herself out of her thoughts to look at the source, though she didn't need to in order to recognise that accent. Jacob Marshall stood at their table, coffee in hand. He was still chewing his toothpick. How on earth could he drink coffee and chew a toothpick at the same time?<br><br>"Detective Marshall," Illiana greeted. "How're things in the wild wild west?"<br><br>"The usual. Takin' a break from herdin' cattle to have a nice cup o' joe," Marshall replied. He pulled a seat over from the neighbouring table and promptly sat in it. "You don't mind, do yeh?"<br><br>"Not at all," Illiana replied in a neutral tone. She hadn't figured out whether she liked the detective or not yet, and was refraining from passing judgement until the trial was over. They were clearly on opposing sides, with Antonio in the middle dividing them. "I thought you had business to attend to, though?"<br><br>"Coffee should be ev'ryone's business," Marshall answered. Yoshimitsu laughed. "Takin' a break too?"<br><br>"Sort of. We have to wait to talk to some potential witnesses, so we stopped for lunch."<br><br>"Not eatin' anythin'? That's a bad diet."<br><br>"Just not very hungry," Illiana answered quickly, aiming to avoid a conversation about her diet. It wasn't the diet topic that worried her, it was how perceptive Marshall appeared to be. <br><br>"That's how it gets on murder cases," Marshall said sagely. He took his toothpick from his mouth briefly to sip some coffee, replacing it as soon as his cup was on the table again. So that was how he did it. "Yeh get caught up in the action an' forget to feed yehself. Don't see too much of that any more."<br><br>"How come?" Illiana asked, though she had a feeling that she'd regret asking soon enough.<br><br>"Work's hard to come by for me," Marshall stated. "Not much call for a freelance detective nowadays, not with people like Inspector Landsvale on permanent payroll."<br><br>"I see." Illiana glanced at Yoshimitsu, who had a strange look on his face. As though he was trying to figure something out, but couldn't quite put his finger on it. <br><br>"'Course, my job's probably a helluva lot more dangerous than yours, Miss Attorney," Marshall continued with a cheeky grin. "Defense attorneys don't usually end up wranglin' with murderers. Though, I guess yeh already know 'Tonio so maybe I'm wrong."<br><br>"Antonio is no killer," Illiana replied, slightly forcefully. "I think I've spent enough time around him to know that fact."<br><br>"How can yeh be sure?" Marshall asked. "Are you tellin' me yeh know him inside out?"<br><br>"Not at all," Illiana answered honestly. She sipped her coffee again, the cup clinking as it touched the table again. "There's loads of stuff I don't know or understand about Antonio, but I can say with absolute certainty that he's not a murderer and wouldn't be involved in one, least of all one that implicates him as having a hand in it."<br><br>"And yeh'll stick with that, eh?" Marshall challenged.<br><br>"I'll represent him in court and get rid of the lies one by one until the truth is known," Illiana replied calmly. Marshall looked at Illiana for a long moment, as though he was measuring her up.<br><br>"I had yeh all wrong, Miss Attorney," Marshall admitted. "I though yeh were defendin' him because yeh were helpin' with the murder or somethin'. Some tie to 'Tonio that'd give you reason to help him. Yeh smarter and more honest than that. Haven't seen that in a lawyer in a while."<br><br>"You thought I'd have a hand in the murder?" Illiana asked, resting her hands around her cup. "Why?"<br><br>"I know 'Tonio, an' I'd wager I know him a lot better than yeh do, either of yeh," Marshall explained. There was a strange edge to his voice, almost defensive. "An' he's no stranger to lies. When I heard yeh knew him, I thought he'd pulled in another seedy contact."<br><br>"You really don't like him, do you?" Yoshimitsu chipped in, his face still curious and calculating.<br><br>"I don't, naw. Like I said, he landed me into a bit o' trouble a while back," Marshall stated. He gulped his coffee, finishing it in one. "Anyway, I have stuff to attend to. Catch you later, Miss Attorney."<br><br>The pair watched at Marshall placed his empty cup on the counter, then strode out of the shop with his hands in his pockets. Yoshimitsu whistled as soon as the door closed again. Illiana let out a nervous laugh. Marshall intimidated her in a way that no one else had before. When he looked at her, it was as though he could see into her words and further into the meaning. As though she could have no secrets while he was around her. It was unnerving, to say the least.<br><br>"What sort of trouble could Antonio have gotten Marshall into?" Illiana asked, unable to hide her curiosity any further.<br><br>"Technically, you can look through Marshall's records," Yoshimitsu said. Illiana heard the meaning behind those words. He was just as curious as she was, and he wanted to find out too. Illiana finished her coffee, then stood up.<br><br>"What are we waiting for, then?"<br><br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler5788460').toggle();if($('#spoiler5788460').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler5788460"><i>POHATU SEZ: Fixed the formatting.</i></div></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">~*~*~2:00 PM, Criminal Affairs Bureau Records Room, Winstone~*~*~<br><br>Illiana pulled open another drawer, met once again with more files than she could count. Inside the drawer, files on people with surnames beginning with the letter "m". She flipped through in reverse. Miles, Michael, Meek, McDonald, McColl, McAbe, more Mc-names that she flipped straight past. No "Marshall" in this drawer. She slid it shut again, and opened the next. Somewhere nearby, Yoshimitsu was flipping through the "J"s in case someone had messed up and placed the file in the wrong place.<br><br>"Why do so many names start with Mac?" Illiana asked, receiving a chuckle from her friend. She continued her hunt. <br><br>"Doesn't look like his file's in this one," Yoshimitsu called to Illiana. "People here must really be on the ball with filing."<br><br>"With officers like Williams? Not surprised," Illiana replied. She skimmed a few names, her eyes finally resting on the file she was hunting. Marshall, Jacob. Before opening it, she questioned the choices that had lead her to this point. She couldn't decide why, exactly, she was hunting down Marshall's file. She had bluffed her way in, saying that there was a potential link between the murder investigation, but she wasn't being entirely truthful. Now that she had the file in her hands, however, she was hesitant. There was a link. Out of everyone involved in the case so far, Marshall had one thing that no one else did.<br><br><i>Motive.</i><br><br>"What's up?" Yoshimitsu asked, appearing at Illiana's side. He nodded to the file. "Not gonna read it?"<br><br>"Marshall... I'm worried," Illiana admitted, her eyes not leaving his name. "I get the feeling that once I open this file, the entire case might change."<br><br>"Only one way to find out, I guess," Yoshimitsu encouraged.<br><br>Illiana nodded, and pulled back the cord binding the plastic. Inside was a collection of different papers, mostly barely informative data sheets. She skim read a few of them, looking for some information regarding Marshall and Antonio. His career history was interesting enough. A permanent payroll detective, working right here in Winstone up until three years ago when he was let go due to endangering his co-workers. She glanced down the page, her eyes resting on a single line.<br><br><font face="courier"><b>Suspect in the burglary of Edward Diamond.</b></font>[/b]<br><br>"Edward Diamond?" Illiana asked, frowning.<br><br>"World's largest recorded diamond, it was stolen years ago but no culprit was ever found," Yoshimitsu explained briefly. "Of course, it had to be..."<br><br>"Doesn't surprise me," Illiana cut in before Yoshimitsu could say Antonio's name.<br><br>"So somehow the blame was pinned on Marshall?" Yoshimitsu asked, though not directing the question at Illiana. "Is there any more about it in there?"<br><br>Illiana flipped through the sheets again, finally finding a sheet on light pink paper. It was titled, "Edward Diamond Theft". <br><br>"They're not overly imaginative with names, are they?" Illiana commented. Yoshimitsu laughed, and the pair read the sparse information given.<br><br><font face="courier"><b>Prime suspect for theft: The Butterfly<br>Secondary suspect: Jacob Marshall<br>Received an anonymous tip regarding Marshall<br>In court, information regarding Marshall's knowledge of The Butterfly was revealed.<br>No conclusive evidence was provided linking Marshall to the Butterfly.<br>Case ended with no one convicted.</b></font>[/b]<br><br>"I knew it," Illiana muttered. "Marshall has the motive to try to link Antonio to the crime. He might be able to link Antonio and The Butterfly too."<br><br>Illiana and Yoshimitsu looked at each other, Illiana's troubled expression prominent on her features. She couldn't read Yoshimitsu's expression.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Julia didn't bother masking her confusion at the shampoo bottle, but she assumed that a bald man would be carrying one around for business rather than personal use.<br><br>"Open it if you like..."<br><br>The doctor took the bottle, simultaneously surprised and not that the container didn't feel heavy or unstable enough to be holding a liquid. She unscrewed the top and looked inside to find a wad of paper towel.<br><br>"I guess there's more inside?" she wondered aloud. Williams gave a half nod. Julia could see that he wasn't sure if she was talking to him or not.<br><br>The doctor used her free hand to unzip her purse and rummaged around inside it, eventually pulling out a white latex glove. She placed the bottle on the ground, gloved up, then gently reached inside the container to pluck out the tissues. After much tearing and sticking to the wet surfaces inside, Julia eventually worked the wad out. Yes, something was inside. She unwrapped it carefully, and before the last layer was undone, she could already tell that the vial was glowing an ethereal blue. As the vial became completely exposed, the doctor felt an odd tingle in her hands and at the back of her mind.<br><br>Julia raised an eyebrow as she held the vial up to the light. "Magic. Not sure what, but the blue indicates some kind of power of the mind, I think."<br><br>With that, Julia pulled the wrist up of her glove off her hand and surrounding the vial in latex. She tied it off with a quick not then put it in her jacket pocket. "I'll get this back to Saeptum as soon as possible. Thank you for bringing this to us, Commissioner."<br><br>The woman smiled and reached out a hand to shake the man's hand again. <br><br>She then walked back into the jail cell. Barclay was slouched against a wall playing with a spinning ink splatter that floated in the area. "Are you finished in here?"<br><br>"Totes done, babe."<br><br>Julia didn't even give him the pleasure of an eye roll. "Then let's go. We have a delivery that needs to be made."<br><br>Barclay bounced up to his feet. "Sweet. This place is super boring."<br><br>With that, the two walked (well, Julia walked; Barclay did more of a rhythmic strut) back through the long series of corridors to the outside world.</div></div>

Other RPs exist. I have other commitments beyond Househeld. I'd nearly forgotten. I was in quite the silly old trance just then. Let me attempt to dredge up some measure of creativity not squeezed from the tears shed by my monitor-weary eyes after spending fifty thousand hours reading Homestuck. Mind you, it's not going to be easy. After all, I have basically gone completely off the deep end in every way, as is now painfully obvious to everyone with a brain.</i></div><br>“Good afternoon, Commissioner,” hailed a voice, and Williams noticed for the first time a nurse in a white smock standing at the other end of the hall. A middle-aged woman with graying brown hair. Behind her, a security officer who gave the Commissioner a brief salute. Among the adornments on the cart the nurse pushed were: two syringes in a shallow chrome basin; two pills on a plate; a tiny plastic cup of water; two bandaids; a ziplock bag containing a larger cup with a yellow sponge inside.<br><br>“Afternoon,” said Williams with another glance at the syringes. “You don’t have the flu going around, do you? I need to wash my hands?”<br><br>The nurse smiled. “Nothing like that. Just a daily injection.”<br><br>“Who’s the inmate?” asked the Commissioner, nodding to the door where the other two had stopped.<br><br>“SC4-9140,” the guard promptly answered, with an unhelpful precision that Williams found himself powerless to berate.<br><br>“Saybolt,” the nurse clarified. “He’s only been with us a couple months – you might have seen it on the news…”<br><br>In fact, Williams had read it in the <i>Winstone Post</i> (he had little use for news programs on the television; while there was barely much of an argument at this point that the papers were any less diseased with hype, propaganda and sensational reporting than televised newscasts, at least the <i>Post</i> gave him all the time he needed to actually digest a new piece of information and weigh it against his hitherto knowledge). Such-and-such Saybolt, a Power with such-and-such society-breaking ability, arrested on such-and-such counts in the Cianwood area and eventually clapped off to this very penitentiary. He’d lost track of the specifics: as a convict on the loose, Saybolt had been outside Williams’ immediate area of concern. And there was certainly nothing unusual about more hazardous Powers trickling into this facility from the outer reaches of Johto. Still, the Commissioner was easily annoyed with himself by such lapses in memory: he really should have been able to name all the prisoners in Special Confinement as well as their transgressions off the top of his head. They were his true interest, after all.<br><br>The nurse had correctly interpreted his silence. “Say hello while you’re here? He’s perfectly safe,” she added. “Actually it’ll only be safer with <i>you</i> around, now that I think of it.”<br><br>Williams nodded. “If you don’t mind.”<br><br>The officer stepped forward with his ring of keys, and as his boots came down on the concrete floor just outside the door, Williams saw a black shape materialize beneath his feet. A complex, mathematical shape – a ring of angles and points. The dark glow shimmered for an instant before fading away again. The officer, who had taken no notice, turned the key in the lock, rolled the door open and walked into the dark cell. The nurse followed him, her cart rattling; again the inscribed shape appeared momentarily underneath her shoes as she crossed the threshold. The security officer, standing at attention on the other side of the doorway, caught sight of the hesitant Williams and nodded. “It’s okay,” he said. “What matters is it knows who you’re <i>not</i>.”<br><br>So Commissioner Williams set down both feet firmly on the space in front of the doorway, to allow the caster’s fractal ample time to register and sanction his presence, before he entered the cell.<br><br>It was a tiny, bare room, empty save for the bed. There, strapped to the mattress at the wrists, waist and ankles, lay a tall, buzz-cut, stocky man of top-heavy build dressed not in the orange scrubs of a prisoner but in a bedrobe. His skin was pale and veiny, his eyes baggy and sunken, and Williams’ first thought was that the man looked as if he belonged in a proper hospital. But that was impossible, of course, or at least unfeasible, because what hospital would knowingly take in a patient whose presence might put the lives of their other dependents at risk? There’d been that one clinic – not in Winstone, thank god, out in Sinnoh somewhere – a decade or so back. Their final inpatient had been a “leveller” – a gravity manipulator. Turned out doping him up on morphine had <i>not</i> had the desired effect of toning down his abilities. All it’d accomplished was to make him lose touch with their extent: He’d been numbed to his own power. One ward got flattened and that hospital had closed its doors.<br><br>There was the humanitarian argument: institutions with the aim of saving lives wanted no volatile factors, no potential time bombs, within their walls. Too many helpless invalids might suffer unjustly as they had in Sinnoh. There was also, Williams was not too righteously short-sighted to notice, the financial argument. To wit: if the community got wind that St. Adelaide Medical Center &amp; Nursing Home had admitted a woman with a cranial injury and a tendency to start hurricanes around herself whenever she got upset, most sensible citizens’ reaction would be to give old Addie a miss for a while. Enough budgets had been hacked down to size for this very reason to make hospitals wary of taking in Powers even here, let alone throughout the rest of the world. <br><br>None of which, however, changed the fact that this man Saybolt looked to be in a pretty ugly state.<br><br>“How’re you feeling today?” the nurse asked, but she received no answer, for as soon as Saybolt noticed Williams, his eyes widened, with a savage shine recalling a cornered animal. His fingers gave a sudden, violent twitch and he pulled back against the straps of the bed.<br><br>“No no – you don’t need to worry, the Commissioner was just passing through. He’s not here for you.” The prisoner relaxed slightly at that, and the nurse continued in a quieter voice, “Really, are you feeling all right today?”<br><br>Saybolt mumbled something.<br><br>“Good! Then we’ll just go ahead and…” With continuing reassurance, the nurse offered him the two pills, pressing them (not gingerly, Williams noticed with appreciation; let no nurse be wishy-washy) onto his dry tongue. Then she poured the water into his mouth. Then she peeled away a pair of bandaids from his bare, shaved arms. His dull expression flickered not at all throughout this routine, nor even when she picked up the first needle and carefully injected it into his left wrist.<br><br>“What is it?” Williams muttered to the security officer.<br><br>“Suppresses local motor functions. We don’t want SC4-9140 using his hands. Let him get ahold of anything and he’s a <i>lot</i> harder to contain. They found that out the hard way in Cianwood.”<br><br>“Did they?” he asked, watching the nurse deliver the second shot. Saybolt’s fingers twitched no more, only dangled limp at the sides of the bed. Only his slightly furrowed eyebrows betrayed the slightest feeling. After she’d cleaned his wrists, she applied the fresh pair of bandaids. That accounted for all the significant items on the cart except for the sponge in the cup. “Oh, you had another accident, didn’t you,” the nurse was groaning, turning over the folds of the southern region of his bedrobe. “And I keep telling the night shift to pace your liquid intake…”<br><br>“Well, I’ll leave you to it,” said Williams hastily to the guard. Even a Power and a criminal had some dignity. “Keep up the good work, both of you.” And without looking again at the nurse and Saybolt, he raised a quick hand in farewell and stepped out of the cell, Trent's fractal once again shimmering underneath his feet.<br><br>Sharpe’s quarters back down the hall weren’t nearly so bleak. Still recognizably a prison hold, of course, but the room boasted a modest green armchair and an old wooden desk, neither of which Williams had ever noticed on the premises before. Awfully generous of them, providing furniture, when the Commissioner’d known Powers who could have killed the whole staff and escaped from the penitentiary with nothing in hand but a few broken-off splinters. The teenager was resting one elbow on the desk and writing something in a slow, deliberate script. He’d already filled one page, which dangled off the wooden edge next to the sheet he was now writing on; a third piece of paper lay crumpled into a ball at his elbow.<br><br>“So how’d you swing the luxury suite?” Williams asked. “Not <i>bribery</i>, I’m sure.”</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">~*~*~3:30PM HAST, Fascere Order Headquarters, Hawaii~*~*~<br>The blinds were lowered, filtering the bold Hawaiian sun into bars that played across the plush green carpet. There was slight movement, a mouse-sized creature gleaming as it darted through the striations of sunshine. It clambered up an ornate steel column, no more concerned by the vertical inclination than it had been by the level floor. It stopped scrambling for a moment, pausing as the desk’s metal transitioned into perfectly carved granite. Half a foot to the creature’s right, there was a single divot in the marbled viridian stone, as if some hooligan had bashed it with a sledgehammer.<br><br>A well groomed man, his hair more salt than pepper, tapped his silver pen upon the desk. A spreadsheet listing a variety of countries and rows of numbers after each was beneath his left forearm, and a sudoku puzzle printed on glossy paper was to his right. There was a loud knock at the door. And then two more knocks. After a brief respite, the potential guest began hammering away as if he were engaged in a passionate drum solo.<br><br>The man sighed, set down his pen, and then slipped his hand into his breast pocket. When it emerged, he had a tarnished ring upon his little finger.<br><br>“Come in, Nopcsa.”<br><br>The door swung open of its own accord, and revealed a youth. He was attired entirely in white, except for his polished black shoes. A few clear beads embroidered into his dress shirt glimmered in the light. <br><br>“Mornin’ Mr. Tylor. What’s up?” Nopcsa pulled a chair away from the desk with the toe of his shoe, and then threw himself down on it. The gecko that had been darting about all morning quickly dashed for the cover provided by the sudoku booklet.<br><br>“Still accessorizing wonderfully, I must admit. Though Giguere certainly had good taste in jewelry, that ring really brings out the grey in your eyes.”<br><br>“Wouldn’t even think of meeting you without being properly attired…” Auguste raised his fingertip to his temple, and tapped twice, “There’s a reason I keep you gentlemen on a need to know basis.”<br><br>“And blackmailing you with information about your mistress and bank account information has nothing to do with that?” Nopcsa crossed his legs, and leaned back in his seat.<br><br>“Former mistresses and former bank account information, naturally. Much harder to hit a moving target, after all. But yes, that may have been some of my incentive for sending you on a suicide mission to retrieve an artifact that worked best against your own abilities.”<br><br>“Can’t fault a man for trying, can you?”<br><br>“I certainly could have punished you further, but you know me. I make a point of hiring self-starters. I really should anticipate that the type we recruit here have a tendency towards… Overextending their ambitions.” <br><br>“I just wanted a new coffee maker in the break room, and a new foosball table. After all, Siboglinum melted the plastic handles off of the blue team, and you really can’t expect us to go risking our lives for you if we have to make do with a naked metal pole when playing the blue guys. Think about the impact that has on morale!”<br><br>“True, true. I’d placed the order for a new table as of your completion of the L. Doyle delivery, but you know how mundane shipping is…” Auguste’s voice slowed with the last few words, the exasperation evident even under his cultivated tones, “Besides, the whole… blackmail matter. It’s more about the principle of the thing than what you were trying to achieve. Consider it a compliment that I didn’t let Nachoset know about what you were trying to pull.”<br><br>“I really would, but I already know you’d deal with a half dozen of me before you’d consider calling him back from the field. <i>In your own words</i>,” Nopcsa said with a confident grin.<br><br>“The man does good work. He… simply works best when he’s not bringing his stab-and-maul policies to a setting more suited for negotiations and pleasantries. He once threatened to vivisect a high ranking politician who was trying to haggle over a certain bauble a few years back…” Auguste sighed again, and raised the puzzle with his fingertips. The gecko, a minute golem hewn from emeralds of varying shades, tentatively climbed up his sleeve.<br><br>“Needless to say, the man did settle on our price, but you can see how that goes against the image we try to project in civilized society.”<br><br>“Yeah, I’m pretty sure that I’m pulling a fifty-nine to aught on my ‘people threatening to stab me’ versus ‘me threatening to stab people’ ratio. I think if I can get a few more death threats, I earn a complementary steak knife, right?” Nopcsa raised his fingertips to his cheek, touching the garish scars that marred his otherwise boyish visage.<br><br>“Indeed, you are certainly a born negotiator…” Tylor’s mustache twitched slightly, “Which I suppose is likely what brings you here.”<br><br>“You called me, not the other way around. Unless we’ve got another chronal inversion field popping up in the break room. Not like this’d be the first time… or the second. It’s as they say, after all. Time flies backwards when you’re having fun.”<br><br>“No, no, I did call you here. But in about thirty seconds, you’ll know as much about this assignment as I do.”<br><br>“Wait, you’re… you’re <i>letting</i> somebody give us an assignment without demanding the full scenario from them?”<br><br>“Afraid so, Nopcsa. We may have the financial and political clout to dominate even mid-sized nations in negotiations, but…”<br><br>“Hoo boy. The red, white, and blue must be asking a favor.”<br><br>“And they’re keeping us on a need to know basis.”<br><br>“Ah, wonderful. So, what do I <i>need</i> to know?”<br><br>“A Power was recently apprehended and accused of murder. Though they didn’t tell me the exact circumstances of the case, it seems that Antonio, accomplice to the famous artifact thief known as ‘The Butterfly’, is the one going on trial for a part in the crime. The Butterfly, the one who supposedly committed the murder, is still at large,” Through the last few words, Auguste’s typically sociable veneer seemed to erode, his eyes narrowing even though he maintained his subdued smile.<br><br>“The Butterfly? Shit, boss! Didn’t he clean out your place once?”<br><br>“Twice, actually. And yet still, I’m more fortunate than many of his victims. But… Something here seems off to me.”<br><br>“No kiddin’. I always thought they called him The Butterfly because he was about as likely to harm somebody as one. Murder is a pretty huge step up, unless his modus operandi was stealing a guy’s pacemaker without the fellow noticing.”<br><br>“It’s not just that, Nopcsa. Though I’m not certain where these orders are coming from, the trial appears to be composed entirely of Powers. The lady who reached me didn’t clarify if this was because The Butterfly was entitled to a jury of his peers, or if the U.S. is simply trying to divorce itself even farther from the government of the Archipelago.”<br><br>“And they wanted me for jury duty. Got it. Yeesh, even if you change your name and live in a scryproof building, they STILL can track you down for it. On the bright side, I’m pretty sure they’ll be giving out some neat little complementary notepads…”<br><br>“That’s just it… They <i>didn’t</i> call me up to get somebody for jury duty. They called me, somebody who has every reason in the world to hate the suspect-“<br><br>“Yes?”<br><br>“And they asked me if I could furnish them with a prosecutor,” Auguste pushed his pen to the side with his fingertips.<br><br>“If I’d so felt, I myself could go and fill the role and do everything within my power to get him convicted. And with my influence and station, that would be a sure thing.”<br><br>“But instead, you’re sending me, a guy with no real knowledge of the legal system, and even LESS knowledge of the convoluted pseudo-American laws in the Archipelago.”<br><br>“I am. Don’t worry about it, I’ve arranged for you to sit behind one M. Hajdu on the flight over, so you should be able to brush up for a couple hours. He’s one of the most eminent legal professionals in the entire Archipelago, and just so happened to be on vacation in Hawaii for the past five days.”<br><br>“’Unfortunately’, one of his clients is having issues dealing with accusations from thirty five women about sexual harassment, and he’s needed to cut his holiday short to come to their aid.”<br><br>“Thirty five women… or one shapeshifter?” Nopcsa’s catlike grin widened.<br><br>“Even when you can’t look inside my head, you’re still quite good at following my train of thought,” Auguste steepled his fingers over his desktop, the gecko crossing over to his other sleeve, “So you’ve probably already figured out why I’m putting you on this assignment.”<br><br>“Yup. You smell a rat, and so you want a man on the ground there who can look in EVERY dark corner. Bonus points for making it look like you’re sending me simply because a mind-reader would make an exceptional prosecutor. Bonus bonus points if I learn the true identity of The Butterfly.”<br><br>“Exactly. However this scenario plays out, I think it’s prudent that we keep the closest eye possible on this case.”<br><br>“I most certainly will, boss.”<br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler5874437').toggle();if($('#spoiler5874437').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler5874437">OOC: So, who here can tell I’ve been watching a lot of Ghost in the Shell?

        <div class="content"><div class="message">~*~*~ Three Years Ago, Criminal Affairs Bureau, Interrogation Room ~*~*~<br><br>Footsteps. Jangling metal with each footfall. The whirling of keys, in a display of power. Jacob Marshall walking down a corridor to meet a suspect or a detainee. It was the same show, and it usually had the same effect on everyone. It usually made them feel inferior, like ants compared to a giant. It was his tried and tested technique. A laid-back officer who knew his place well, and wouldn't fall victim to trickery and lies. Most of the criminals he interrogated were the same, insofar that they feared Jacob Marshall. Rumours circulated around the underworld. They all said the same thing.<br><br><i>Never get caught by Jacob Marshall, or you'll live a sorry life.</i><br><br>He knew the rumours. And he knew what he had done to create them. Jacob Marshall, the detective with more rights than any other on the force. Even if he got a little over-zealous when in action, his ability to contain criminals and make them confess to their crimes was more than enough to instill fear in the hearts of anyone who crossed him.<br><br>There was a slight spring in his step today, though. Something was going right, finally. In his years on the force, he had been seeking out a single criminal who had managed to escape his grasp for far too long. All the other detainees who were behind bars because of him were a distraction, or a necessity depending on who was asking. He didn't want to find himself out of the job, after all, but his primary target was still the Butterfly. Finally, in this case, the Butterfly had left a piece of evidence. While it was his forte to leave behind the ace of diamonds, this one was special. A finger print from an index finger, and it matched up perfectly with the man... no, the <i>boy</i> in the interrogation room.<br><br>The door swung open, and Marshall saw the child sat inside as he walked around to the opposite side of the desk where two cups of coffee lay in wait. Always have the criminal with their back to the door, so they couldn't see who was walking in. The kid was maybe fifteen, sixteen years old, dressed immaculately in a crisp white shirt and black waistcoat, smooth smart trousers and shiny black shoes. He wore silk gloves that shimmered, even in this sparse light. A bored expression was set firmly on his face. Odd, though. The Butterfly was known to wear a half-butterfly mask on one half of his face. This child had nothing of the sort. The only thing Marshall picked up on was the deceit. No magical interference, but a lie all the same. The mask <i>should</i> have been there.<br><br>"Howdy, pardner," Marshall greeted to announce his presence. <br><br>"Detective," the child replied in a bored voice, smoothing the creases in his shirt.<br><br>"Tell me, boy, the Edward Diamond," Marshall started, leafing through the papers in his hands. <br><br>"I have a name," was the immediately response. Almost a knee-jerk reaction, Marshall noted. Kid didn't like to be looked down on, apparently.<br><br>"I don't care, pardner," Marshall retorted. "Yeh a criminal, an' yeh deserve the respect that any criminal does. None."<br><br>"Come now, Detective, do you really imagine a mere child like myself is capable of such a theft?" <br><br>"As a matter of fact, pardner, I do," Marshall replied. He glanced down at a sheet of paper in front of him. Kid's name was Antonio Sharpe. That was a classy name. "I've seen stranger things in my life. A kid robbin' a big diamond? Not surprisin', pardner."<br><br>"And you are under the mistaken impression that I stole the diamond, correct?" Antonio queried.<br><br>Marshall saw it on the word 'mistaken'. A flash of colour. The kid was lying. <br><br>"An' how are yeh so sure I'm mistaken?" Marshall asked, a smug look on his face.<br><br>"I assure you, I did not steal the diamond."<br><br>Again, a flash of colour. A stronger lie. Antonio's colours, at least through Marshall's sight, warped and flashed into inverse for just a second. <br><br>"I'll give yeh an easy question, then," Marshall stated. "Where were yeh on the third of March at aroun' one in the mornin'?"<br><br>"I was, naturally, awake and around the city," Antonio responded. Marshall laughed. It wasn't a lie, but a cleverly worded statement.<br><br>"An' yeh'll have an alibi for that, will yeh?" <br><br>"And associate myself with the intoxicated ruffians who plague the city at that time? Of course not," Antonio retorted, as though Marshall had personally offended him. <br><br>"So yeh still the biggest suspect, pardner," Marshall concluded. "Yeh print was on the card, yeh've got no alibi an' a kid like you has the personality for grand-scale thievery. Taste for pricey things, arrogant enough to do it and smart enough to pull it off. Yeh follow the Butterfly's M.O. perfectly, pardner."<br><br>"A person of my age is unlikely to have broken into the museum," Antonio retorted.<br><br>"It's unlikely, yeh," Marshall agreed. "Unless yeh've got a way in or knowledge of the security systems. Yeh know that's not impossible."<br><br>"And I have no such knowledge."<br><br>"Yeh lying to me now, pardner? They shoot yeh for that in Texas."<br><br>"Detective," Antonio said. There was an unknown quality in his voice now. Was it... triumph? "I can't help but notice, your eyes have an unusual quality."<br><br>"Oh they do, do they?" Marshall asked. He knew where this was going, but wasn't sure how to respond. No one had ever questioned the changing colour of his pupils before.<br><br>"Whenever I have told you a false statement during this conversation, they have changed from green to yellow," Antonio stated calmly. "The green is unusual enough. The rumours circulating about you. 'Jacob Marshall, the blue-eyed cowboy'. So, why were your eyes green? I was curious."<br><br>"An' what did yeh deduce, pardner?" Marshall asked, a challenging tone to his voice. "What did a cocky little brat like yeh make of that?"<br><br>"Every time I said a false statement, your eyes would flicker to yellow," Antonio stated calmly. "From the moment you entered the room, I have had a single false fact running through the entire conversation."<br><br>"Yeh mask," Marshall breathed. The kid was right. No one had ever picked up on his power. How had this kid managed to completely analyze and deconstruct his truth-detecting sight in the space of only a few minutes.<br><br>Antonio did not respond verbally to the comment, but a smug smirk told Marshall that he was right. Clever boy. If the kid had confirmed the mask, the statement could be used in court.<br><br>"So, what now, detective?" Antonio asked. "You are obviously in a very delicate position. I will state my terms now."<br><br>"Yeh in no position to negotiate, boy," Marshall challenged. His job was more important than his pride. Bringing this cocky punk to justice was more important than maintaining his secret, surely?<br><br>"If you insist on detaining me, an innocent victim, I will spread the knowledge of your... <i>technique</i> among the general population," Antonio stated calmly, interlocking his fingers. "Given your superiors, you will lose your job, your pride and any respect among your peers. You will be left jobless, moneyless, defeated and dejected."<br><br>"An' the alternative?"<br><br>"If you tell your superiors that I was framed, I will let the whole thing slide and put it in the past," Antonio continued. "You will lose a sliver of respect, for not being able to apprehend a culprit to the theft. However, you will keep your standing as a detective."<br><br>Marshall swallowed.<br><br>What should he do?<br><br>~*~*~Present day, 2:00PM, Winstone Penitenary~*~*~<br><br>Antonio looked up as the Commissioner addressed him, but quickly looked back down to the sheet of paper in front of him. He was having a little difficulty feigning outrage in a letter of complaint, though it mattered little since he was only half-heartedly writing it in the first place. He had no intention of handing in a letter of complaint. He would probably sue the police force for emotional trauma. Easier, and more embarrassing for the force.<br><br>"Hardly, Commissioner," he replied, without looking up again. "It would be common courtesy, I suppose, for your men to supply a more comfortable suite when you are holding me on such ludicrous charges."<br><br>Antonio delicately placed the pen on the table, folded up the paper and left it on the desk. He stood up gracefully, smoothing out the folds in his clothes as he approached the bars of the cell. Taking an extra moment, he adjusted the cuffs on his sleeves, pulled his clothes more firmly on to his hands and ran his fingers through his ruffled hair. He finally looked at the Commissioner, his expression peaceful, almost content. It was a good facade, for Antonio actually felt exceptionally smug to be looking at the man who he had so soundly embarrassed. It had reached Antonio's attention that the Commissioner had installed security cameras in his own office after the small theft of his badge. The teenager had enjoyed a quiet laugh over that.<br><br>"What brings you to my humble abode, Commissioner?"</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Can't you guess? Or've you forgotten why we even met in the first place?" Williams growled, stepping in to lean a forearm against the bars of the door. Another dark fractal flickered predictably beneath his shoes. "The terms in your letter specified what would happen if I won. There wasn't anything in there about the deal breaking off just in case you got arrested. And I'm pretty sure that means you still owe me something."<br><br>Sharpe tutted softly and let his eyes wander upward.<br><br>The Commissioner blinked. "Oh, I'm sorry," he said. "Am I not being <i>courteous</i> enough to you? Are we imposing on you, here? Wasting your precious time? Well, here's something else you've forgotten: A man was <i>killed</i> yesterday. There, write that one down, maybe it'll sink in. And a few more lives've been torn apart because of it." Williams stared him down, trying to read his face, but the kid was as deadpan as ever. "Now I guess you're too much of a screwed-up little shit to feel sorry for him even if you had nothing to do with the murder. So be it, buddy, it's up to you what to think. But when you bitch and moan about how 'ludicrous' it is that you're here, Sharpe, that doesn't tell me you're an innocent man. All that tells me is that you don't give a <i>rat's ass</i> whether Larry Odio's killer gets brought to justice or not.<br><br>"Now--" he went on, before swallowing forcibly: his throat felt dry. "The prize. Tell me what you know about the Butterfly. I hear anything that might be worth our time, we'll come back with a recording crew and put your disclosure in the books. Cut a step or two out of the trial, make things easier on everyone. Well? Are you talking or not?"</div></div>

Not much clientele, he imagined, as he ran his finger over the revolver hanging at his waist. Three years ago, he had been tempted to become one of the base criminals he arrested on a regular basis. A fateful encounter to be sure, and one that left a sour taste in his mouth. Barely hours after he had been forced to cut a deal with a criminal, which nearly destroyed his reputation. <br><br>Yoon Mangjeol was the woman he had visited that night. He had heard of her too many times. A woman who revolved around information. Her lust for cash was pretty prominent too. She'd taken a month's wages from him that night, and it had only just been worth it. Even now, she was coming close to bankrupting him every month. <br><br>She wasn't here right now. Away, apparently. In Europe, if he was remembering correctly. Not that it mattered anyway. <br><br>~*~*~Three Years Ago, Passione Rossa, Midnight~*~*~<br><br>It was cold. Remarkably so, though given a Johto winter it was not overly surprising. Snowflakes drifted down lightly from the sky, a dusting of white on the concrete landscape. There was a regular crunching sound, followed by a light jangle of metal. There was something almost defiant yet dejected about the noise. Jacob Marshall walked the streets, gun firmly placed at his hip and hat tilted low to prevent snow from blinding him. He turned a corner and took a few more steps. A quick glance over his shoulder before he pushed open the door to the bar.<br><br>The woman he was seeking sat there, in her usual table. Distinctly underdressed for the weather, he thought, but then she’d have been here since before the snowfall picked up this evening.<br><br>"Howdy, Miss," he greeted casually, a grin coming to his face naturally.<br><br>“Good evening, sir," Miss Mangjeol replied, a faint smile on her face as her finger circled the rim of her wine glass. "Have a seat, won’t you? Only would you mind hanging your cloak on the rack? I dislike snow encroaching on this space.”<br><br>"Of course," Marshall agreed, slipping his poncho off to reveal a dark blue shirt, a shiny star-shaped medal affixed to the breast. He ensured it was securely hanging on the rack before taking the seat opposite her.<br><br>“How about a sip of something to warm you up?” Miss Mangjeol offered, gesturing to a nearby waitress.<br><br>"Don' mind if I do," he answered. The waitress paused at the table. "Whatever whiskey yeh sellin' here, big a glass as yeh can give me."<br><br>The waitress hurried off to retrieve the drink.<br><br>“Now then, sir. How may I help you? Are you here to buy or sell?” Mangjeol asked, her finger still on the glass. The waitress returned with the drink. Marshall handed over a twenty dollar bill, declining any change.<br><br>"Yeh could say I've got a few questions," he stated, taking a healthy swig of the whiskey. Staying relaxed was key to these situations.<br><br>“Ah. To buy, then. Very good. Well: state your first subject, and I’ll give you a cost estimate for the most thorough answer I may provide.”<br><br>"Ah, Miss Mangjeol, mah apologies," Marshall corrected quickly. "What I mean' to say is I have some questions about myself."<br><br>She cocked her head slightly. “Do you mean, questions to which you already know the answers? You haven’t been struck on the head and contracted amnesia? Your memories haven’t been erased by a psion?”<br><br>"I know the answers, yeh," Marshall confirmed, ignoring her faintly sardonic tone. "An' if I know the answers, is it fair to charge me?"<br><br>“Hmm! How unusual…” Miss Mangjeol had finally stopped twirling her wine glass, and sipped it slowly before she continued. “Though, if you were to ask me such a question, I think we can agree that the answer itself wouldn’t be your aim, would it? What you truly want is to find out whether <i>I</i> know the answer as well. That’s a separate line of inquiry altogether, which, I’m afraid, most certainly has a value to you!” She gave a small titter. “But of course it will depend on the question, and I’ll keep my answers as inexpensive as reason permits.”<br><br>"I see," he said, somewhat quieter than his usual tone. "That's fair, I guess. Alrighty then, who am I?"<br><br>“Detective Jacob Marshall," she answered at once. "On the house. I’d feel terribly guilty charging you for that one: your accent and attire give you away in an instant.”<br><br>"An' yeh'll already know that I'm a Power then," he commented. "Can yeh tell me what it is?"<br><br>“Twenty dollars.” Marshall slipped a note from his pocket across the table. “I believe I can, yes.”<br><br>"Alrighty then, what is it?"<br><br>“Twenty dollars.” Again, he handed over the money. “Flight and fire control.”<br><br>The music overhead wound down, and there was a moment of relative silence in between songs for him to stare at the Asian woman with surprise and indignation. Though his vision flickered, there was no need: this lie was so blatant the waitress could’ve spotted it, if she hadn’t been giving the table such a wide berth since his arrival. He let out a hoarse half-cough of dismissal. "Miss Mangjeol, if yeh not gonna take me seriously, I'm 'fraid you owe me a refund," he stated, drumming his fingers against his revolver.<br><br>“Just a moment, please!" Miss Mangjeol said quickly, though she did not waver. "That was a test, Detective, nothing more. Allow me one further guess. If my next words fail to ring true, then the money’s yours.”<br><br>Doubtful, Marshall wagered. If this was how Mangjeol conducted her business, he was disgusted. He had come with a purpose in mind, not to be ridiculed by a woman who’d peddled crumbs of information to murderers and thieves and somehow thought she had the right to turn her nose up at him.<br><br>Still... Something about her wording put him on guard.<br><br>"Jes’ hope this guess is better than yer last one," Marshall stated, leaving the threat hanging in the air.<br><br>“Your power informs you when you hear a lie. I’m not sure how exactly you become aware of it yourself, but I know that your eyes flash yellow every time the power is triggered,” Mangjeol explained, sipping her wine again. The detective was damned if there wasn’t something smug in her expression.<br><br>Problem was, she was right. And he could tell she <i>knew</i> she was right. There was no lie present in that statement, so his eyes would’ve remained a crystal clear blue. There was no use trying to deny it, either. He sighed, and took another healthy swig of his whiskey.<br><br>"An' how did yeh find out?"<br><br>“Sixty dollars.” Pricey, this time. Marshall made a quick note of the money left on him, then slid sixty dollars across the table. They vanished instantly into Mangjeol’s beaded money-purse, and she straightened up in her seat. “Upon reflection, I’m not sure whether you’ll be relieved or disturbed to hear that no one has ever sold me the knowledge of your power. Shall we call it a very well-educated guess instead?” She smiled. “You see I’ve taken quite an interest in you, Detective, and your flawless record in interrogation. I’ve laid down a considerable investment in order to speak with convicts, ex-convicts and suspects whom you’ve ‘put through the wringer’. Not one of them could pinpoint with any certainty what it was that made you so capable. But they noticed the eyes, Detective. Or rather – I shouldn’t imply all of them did. The suspects who’d been found innocent never recalled seeing your eyes change color. Nor did the criminals who’d pled guilty from the start.” Her tone dropped, and her gaze darkened. “In other words, those who’d never felt the need to <i>lie</i> to you, Jacob Marshall… couldn’t even remember what color your eyes had been to begin with. As for the rest… Now what hypothesis do you think I could’ve drawn from this?”<br><br>"And yeh interested in this because?" Marshall asked, resting his hand on the revolver. "An' don't try to charge me for that one."<br><br>Mangjeol tittered again, then replied, "Detective, it's almost unheard of. A law-enforcer blessed with the power of breaking down all suspects in a crime and discerning the ultimate truth of the matter? Don’t you realize how interesting people find this?"<br><br>"Naw, but then I've grown up with it," he replied.<br><br>"Of course, your colleagues care only for your prowess in your field, not for the techniques you use," she continued. "Short-sighted of them, though, really, don’t you think? If anyone beyond myself figured out exactly what your gift was, I imagine there could follow quite a scandal, wouldn’t you say? Mind, a human polygraph isn’t the worst sort of Power you could find on a Commissioner’s payroll, but at least the ordinary polygraph is a <i>machine</i>. Built by human hands, such a thing may be pieced apart, analyzed, and tested. Whereas the legal minds of Winstone would swoop like vultures upon any supernatural form of lie detection that defied scientific scrutiny! You’d lose your post overnight.”<br><br>He swallowed uncomfortably, remembering the kid’s words: <i>I can't help but notice, your eyes have an unusual quality</i>… "An' has anyone come sniffin' around?"<br><br>“One hundred dollars,” she said brightly, at once. Marshall tutted heavily. There was nothing else for it, though – he couldn’t afford not to know. But she’d run through nearly all the money he had on him by this point. He pulled out a few more bills, and handed them over slightly roughly. “Yes,” she went on, “and more than a few, I assure you.”<br><br>Marshall waited a beat, expecting more of an explanation than that. But she simply smiled politely and held his gaze without another word.<br><br>"An' are yeh gonna tell me who?" he demanded in a moment.<br><br>“Dear man, I can already see I’ve carved a deep gouge in your wallet! You can’t really be prepared to go on? The price of giving you even one truthful name will be well beyond our transactions so far.”<br><br>"Yeh have a point there, I s'pose," the Detective conceded, draining his glass. He probably only had enough money on him for another drink at this rate. "An' if someone comes askin' around now?"<br><br>Miss Mangjeol blinked. “Isn’t that obvious? What am I here for? I’ll tell them everything I know. That’s assuming they can meet the price, of course. If it’s any comfort, no petty thug off the street could possibly afford to learn your power, and that is a promise. It’ll be much too expensive for <i>them</i>. But the interests, the institutions – the men with real money in their coffers – where they’re concerned, I can’t make any promises.”<br><br>Marshall considered this for a troubled second. Information surrounding his power could hit the streets in ten minutes, considering his current luck. Even the promise of 'no petty thug' wasn't enough to ease his mind. He pressed on with increasing desperation. “But what if yeh told ‘em somethin’ else? Couldn’ yeh tell ‘em my power works some other way?” He searched for an alternative. “What if… What if yeh told ‘em my power works around fear instead o’ lies? Ah can tell when people are afraid. That’s when my eyes flash. You couldn’ – ?”<br><br>Mangjeol’s smile vanished completely. The expression that stepped in to fill the void was much colder. If he hadn't stared down worse criminals, Marshall would have pointed his revolver at the woman in front of him.<br><br>“Oh no,” she said. “No, that’s utterly out of the question. Are you surprised? Perhaps you think it’s a matter of principle? Not quite, Detective, though I’d like to be so virtuous. The stake is my career. I’ve never told a customer a lie – not, that is, within the sphere of our transactions. I never will. All it’d take would be for one swindled patron to prove I’d lied to them, and my life would be over. Literally, I shouldn’t wonder, to judge from some of my clientele.”<br><br>"An' how about if yeh keep mum about it?" Marshall asked. "Yeh not lyin' that way, so yeh info couldn't be suspect. Course, I'm not askin' yeh to do it for free. Name yeh price."<br><br>“Ah! There, now you’re thinking! Yes, I’ve made such arrangements before. Regular payments every few months, scaled up or down depending on how many customers have broached the subject since the last payment. Nothing bank-breaking, mind you. Just another bill of sorts," said Miss Mangjeol, a slight tone of glee entering her voice. She had returned to twirling her glass with her finger again. "And, naturally, you may terminate payment anytime if, in the future, you feel more comfortable with your information going public…”<br><br>“Sure ‘nough,” he agreed, “but what if it goes public without me? Ah mean what if someone else puts two an’ two together without my knowin’?”<br><br>Miss Manjgeol took another lick of wine and thought about it for a long moment.<br><br>“I suppose…” she began softly, “on account of my great fondness for money… that I’ll continue charging you for my silence until you’ve worked out for yourself that the situation has changed, at which point of course our arrangement will cease…”<br><br>Detective Marshall slammed his empty glass onto the table, stood up, and very nearly pulled his revolver on the woman, though he was able to divert his movement at the last second into seizing his poncho off the rack instead. As he swept it over his form, he took a savage joy in watching the half-melted droplets and flakes of snow which, flung off the cloth and across the table, barraged a wilting Mangjeol in her seat.<br><br>“Now, I’ve offended you and I see that,” she continued, dabbing at her cheeks with her scarf. “But don’t you understand, Detective? If you’ll excuse a cliché, the truth will out! All facts <i>yearn</i> to be known by as many people as possible; that is their one and only aspiration. How do you think I prefer to conduct my business? By allowing information to flow as freely as possible – provided that it always charts a path through this bar, of course! Secrets are dangerous things, Detective, and however one chooses to deal with them, there will always be hazards. Bereaved souls like yourself come to me with secrets, looking to acquire my confidence, to be assured of my silence on the matter, and they always believe that way lies security. Yet I have power only to protect them from the rest of my clientele, not an entire world full of reasoning, discerning minds! Will I swindle you, should it happen that I and not you become aware that your secret was separately leaked? Yes, for as long as I can, and with a smile. But just suppose another critical thinker out there works out your power by a natural process of deduction just as I have, quite unbeknownst to either of us, and lets the secret slip? Then I shall be swindling you innocently, if you continue paying for my silence, and you and I will be equally helpless to correct the error. You see, Detective, that risk will be there forever! Why, why do so many of my clients think that purchasing my silence will give them peace of mind? They’re merely exchanging one set of concerns for another, why don’t more of them understand this? I <i>want</i> to ease their minds, I’d like nothing better, but this can only happen one way – if they have it out, if they expose their secrets to the world! Think of it: at least then you needn’t fret whether this enemy or that one has gotten ahold of the knowledge or not. You simply assume they have access to it, and then proceed appropriately. <i>There</i>, and nowhere else, lies the only true absolution I can offer to those who bear secrets. And so I ask again, Detective: will you purchase my silence, or will you yield your secret of your own volition and on your own terms?”<br><br>Jacob Marshall, who had stood motionless, transfixed, now made a mighty effort to persuade himself to let it go, that she was welcome to it, and that he would be ready to face the consequences. He thought again of the child he’d met earlier that evening, who’d already threatened to expose the secret, though only as a bargaining chip… Could Antonio Sharpe be trusted to hold his silence as long as Marshall complied with his demands?<br><br><i>If you tell your superiors that I was framed, I will let the whole thing slide and put it in the past. You will lose a sliver of respect, for not being able to apprehend a culprit to the theft. However, you will keep your standing as a detective…</i><br><br>The child hadn’t been lying when he’d promised this. Marshall’d <i>known</i> that, confound it. Still, there was no reason he couldn’t simply change his mind later on and expose Marshall anyway. Sharpe had certainly demonstrated he was enough of a conniving little upstart that Marshall wouldn’t put it past him. Why, then, should the detective bother investing in Miss Mangjeol’s silence…? But then he envisioned the papers, his name and face plastered all over them. He saw himself disgraced, penniless, barred for life from the only work that meant anything to him. And he knew he had to take every step necessary to prevent that outcome. If there were holes here and there, he couldn’t give up on their account. He’d simply need to cover them over, one by one.<br><br>Maybe getting rid of the kid was the best way to assure his silence.<br><br>But he’d worry about that later.<br><br>“No,” Marshall said slowly. “I can’t… I can’t let it go, Miss Mangjeol. I need yeh to keep it well under. As best as yeh can. I don’t care about the price, I get paid well enough.”<br><br>“Are you quite sure?”<br><br>“I’m <i>sure</i>,” he insisted, before muttering: “As if I got a choice, even.”<br><br>“Fine!” Mangjeol rubbed her thin hands together. “Of course, quite a lot of what I said just now was entirely hypothetical. Addressed to the <i>general</i> bearer of secrets. Yes, cheer up, Detective, I don’t think your particular situation is as bad as all that! It depends on the secret, and in your case... Are you really worried that I might go months on end profiting off meaningless transactions, charging you for silence on a matter I know full well to have already been breached? But, dear man, assuming your secret were leaked, surely you don’t suppose that much time would wear away before you caught on…?”<br><br>Detective Marshall weighed this in his mind, realized she was quite right, and also realized that this gave him not the least bit of comfort. With a dejected sigh, he hung the poncho on the rack and sank heavily into his seat once more. Miss Mangjeol smiled.<br><br>“Very good,” she said, “and now let us make arrangements.”<br><br>~*~*~2PM, Winstone Penitenary~*~*~<br><br>"Of course I care about Odio's killer being brought to justice, Commissioner," Antonio retorted, looking Williams in the eye. "The sooner he is, the sooner I can leave here."<br><br>"Oh, give me a--"<br><br>"Your prize, Commissioner," Antonio continued, as though Williams was not about to insult him again. "I'll start with something simple. Why on Earth do you think the Butterfly leaves a calling card at the scene of every theft? To alert the police of who stole the object? To brag? As a sign of conquest?"<br><br>Williams remained silent, waiting for Antonio to continue.<br><br>"The Butterfly leaves the card behind as an act of courtesy. If the stolen artifact vanished without a trace, any old suspect may be unjustly called in as I have today and blamed for a crime they did not commit," Antonio said in a bored voice, returning to his nails. He turned and returned to the chair in the cell, resting his hands delicately on the arms. "You see, Commissioner, the Butterfly does not steal objects for monetary value. The profit is a bonus. No, the Butterfly is an artist who obtains items that are difficult or impossible to steal, or as an act of humiliation. If he sees someone who deserves to be put in their place, he has no objections to step in."<br><br>Antonio interlocked his fingers and waited for the response.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Beelzebibble</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Commissioner Williams opened his mouth, hesitated, and sighed.<br><br>"I was about to ask what exactly you think puts you in a position to make such brassy assumptions about the Butterfly's M.O.," he said, "but then I realized I know exactly what you'd say to that. You're his biggest fan. Oh wait, excuse me, that doesn't sound pretentious enough." Williams' next words issued between the bars in a coarse whisper. "You're his <i>most fervent admirer.</i> You've done all the research, followed all the Butterfly's doings from one crime to the next. You write treatises holding this asshole up as some kind of Robin Hood and sign them with a heart. And at the end of the day, you head upstairs and jerk off into a replica of that queer mask.<br><br>"So let's pretend we've already been through that routine, and move ahead a space. Whatever your association with the Butterfly is, you might as well just tell me. We're not looking at the world's cutest coincidence, here. I know damn well he planned this with you."</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Yoshimitsu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"My dear Commissioner," Antonio answered in a voice that was silky, yet with a slight sting. "Your imagery, delicate though you clearly intended, wounds me. Tell me, what exactly did you think the card was for?"<br><br>Antonio paused, half-expecting a response that never came. No matter, Williams was clearly slow to pick up on the point. On any point, in fact. The thought processes of dullards was a mystery to him.<br><br>"You clearly know too little about the Butterfly to doubt any information I am about to dispense to you," Antonio continued. "Do you think him some petty criminal? Some thug who happened to take a handbag from an elderly lady in the street? Commissioner, you are deluded if you think you can ignore anything I say. I know about the Butterfly, and that is enough."<br><br>Antonio stood up and approached the bars again, staring Williams in the face.<br><br>"I am an associate of the Butterfly. I was engaged in a deal with him, which I would have gained quite a profit from," Antonio stated, his face betraying no traces of deception.

As he so clearly chose to ignore his end of the bargain, I feel no need to care for his illusion of anonymity."</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Williams closed his eyes, occasionally wincing, as the detainee rambled on about the Butterfly and all the marvels he brought to the world. <i>You can take it easy, you know,</i> he mentally informed whomever was up there. He'd already met a couple of Power kids today and come round to admitting that they weren't so bad, at least not Silna. Now the cosmic forces had to rub it in by saddling him with an apparently-normal kid in the exact same age bracket who was a complete asshole. Where'd that fucker the Butterfly <i>get</i> cronies like these? How early did he have to start the brainwashing process, to get them so fluently gibbering his praises?

Antonio detested having to converse with gruff, blatantly rude individuals. There was a reason his usual locations were surrounded by self-proclaimed aristocrats. They were rarely rude to another person's face, and they were at least somewhat intelligent.<br><br>"The client offered a monetary reward," Antonio continued.

"However, I am afraid your trail has found its end. You see, the Butterfly is a very cautious man. It is very unusual for him to make arrangements such as this. He makes his face a mystery and never engages his business partner personally. The real face of the Butterfly is just as hidden to you as it is to me."<br><br>Antonio paused for a moment, adjusting his waistcoat slightly and smoothing out invisible creases again.<br><br>"I spread some information around the various clientele of bars similar to the one we engaged our game of poker in," Antonio continued. "It was then that the Butterfly contacted me, through a representative of his. We made our arrangement that way."<br><br>~*~*~2:30PM, Winstone Penitenary~*~*~<br><br>Illiana wandered down the corridor quietly, almost nervously, glancing into the occasional cell. She didn't mean to keep glancing in, but her eyes seemed to have their own agenda from time to time. It was quiet. It had been quiet the first time she had come here today, but at least she had been escorted by a member of the force to the cell itself. Yoshimitsu was following her, a few steps behind, apparently genuinely intrigued by some of the people held here.<br><br>"It's amazing, really," he commented, nodding towards the bars. "I mean, these people probably aren't really bad guys as such, but the fact that Williams can contain Powers once he gets a hold of them. These cells could probably keep Araini in. They could probably even hold Alex."<br><br>"Not bad guys?" Illiana questioned, turning a corner. <br><br>"Well, obviously they've broken the law," Yoshimitsu elaborated. "But the whole system here treats Powers quite harshly. Some of them deserve to be behind bars, but some of them would probably have been fine with a slap on the wrist and a hefty fine. I guess that's Hooper for you."<br><br>"The Advising Judge?" Illiana asked, glancing behind at Yoshimitsu. He nodded in confirmation. "She sounds frightening from what you just said."<br><br>"Couldn't say, never met the woman," Yoshimitsu shrugged. "But the Archipelago's no better off Staudt. The dangerous Powers who deserved the punishment would be free. It's like swinging between two extremes, black and white."<br><br>"Or Light and Darkness?" Illiana asked, with a slight smile on her face. Yoshimitsu laughed.<br><br>Up ahead, in front of the cell they were heading for, they saw someone stood, engaged in conversation with the person they wanted to talk to. Illiana immediately recognised the man as Commissioner Williams, which meant that he was obviously trying to get information from Antonio. Illiana refrained from passing judgement, since Antonio was suspicious in himself and the Commissioner had every right.<br><br>"Are we... interrupting?" she asked hesitantly.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Beelzebibble</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Williams nodded, taking these new details in. He was about to ask whether Sharpe had gone through an information broker, and if so, when this had occurred. Obviously if he'd approached Yoon Mangjeol it wouldn't have been within the past week or so. There were other informants, the Commissioner knew well, but they were harder to find, burrowed deeper between the rocks and roots of this place: after what had become of Franklin Gaussier a couple of years ago, similar brokers in the greater Winstone area typically preferred to keep their heads down. Ostensibly the field was Mangjeol's. Though with the state the wiseguys had been in this past handful of months, that and all conditions were subject to change.<br><br>Unless Sharpe had skipped the brokers altogether and seeded his request another way. Also feasible, just riskier. This wasn't the kind of announcement you put on the bulletin board at Panera...<br><br>"Are we interrupting?"<br><br>It was Ms. Silna. Mr. Yoshimitsu, behind her. Both looked out of place in this environment, their unnatural hair colors a violent contrast against the sterile hues of the corridor. "You won't be," said Williams by way of greeting, "as long as you give me a minute to finish." He turned back to Sharpe before continuing.<br><br>"Did you know the Butterfly had passed you by and gone straight to the source <i>before</i> you originally contacted me, or did you find out afterward? And either way, what's your excuse for arranging the meeting at the exact time and scene of the murder?"</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Yoshimitsu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"I was aware of the fact before I contacted you," Antonio replied. "In fact, I have been aware for a long time now. However, the time taken to perfectly orchestrate an event in which I could maintain my honour, while allowing the information to flow freely. Don't misjudge, Commissioner, I did not plan a murder. The fact that I have been implicated in this case is due to no fault of my own. Clearly, I was being framed for a crime that has no relation to me."<br><br>Antonio paused again, allowing his words to sink in.<br><br>"Make no mistake, Commissioner, I am not guilty of any crime you are blaming me for," he stated simply. "The murder is nothing to do with me."<br><br>Illiana listened to the conversation, and took a wild guess at what had been said before. She gave Yoshimitsu a significant look, demanding that they discuss it later, which Yoshimitsu nodded to. Antonio was not explicitly lying, she could tell that already. There was something there, though. A certain level of false information. She would have to drag it out of Antonio as soon as possible, without raising the alarm and revealing his identity. For now, she contented herself with leaning against a wall and listening in.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Beelzebibble</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Commissioner Williams stood silent, distantly aware that his eyes might be wider open than prudence dictated. If he hadn't been thinking very hard and very quickly, he might have rectified the facial expression sooner. But it was a moment before his brow settled again into a glare and he was able to speak.<br><br>"So you <i>are</i> sticking with the 'world's cutest coincidence' story," he muttered. "Gonna ride that one all the way through the trial, are you? Oh I hope Hooper gets enough of a word in to land you a heavy sentence. Mildred Hooper -- you know she's your advising judge, right?"</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Yoshimitsu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"I do not claim that this was coincidence, Commissioner," Antonio said sharply, for the first time his voice seeming harsh. "Someone is aiming to frame me for a crime I never committed. I am not afraid of Mildred Hooper, just as I am not afraid of you."<br><br>Antonio rested one hand on his hip and relaxed his stance slightly.<br><br>"Commissioner, don't you have other things to be dealing with? You have ceased to be amusing. You are nothing more than tiresome."</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Beelzebibble</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"You aren't afraid of Mildred Hooper?" Williams repeated. "I guess you must not know that much about her, then. Didn't these two give you the whole scoop on her? No, Ms. Silna?" he asked the young woman.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Yoshimitsu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"We... hadn't got around to it yet," Illiana said, somewhat sheepishly. "We only found out that Justice Hooper was the advising judge when we arrived at Mrs. Odio's house."<br><br>"That's partially why we're here," Yoshimitsu stepped in. He too a step forward as he said this. Illiana wagered that the move was to make him seem confident, not that he needed the help. "Illiana has a few questions for Antonio, too. I think it's our place to mention, by the way..."<br><br>Yoshimitsu glanced at Illiana, who understood. <br><br>"Detective Jacob Marshall has his eye on this case, too," she said, stepping away from the wall. "He's been here and at the criminal affairs bureau. We don't know what he wants, as far as we can tell he's just observing everything as it progresses. We just thought you might want to know."</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Beelzebibble</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"...Damn. That so?" Williams rubbed his neck as he took this latest piece in. His head was about ready to twist off his shoulders.<br><br>Jacob Marshall, on the prowl? Williams knew he'd been seen here and there in Winstone even in the time following his public abasement and summary dismissal from the force, but the Commissioner'd never heard of Marshall edging in on any crimes ever since then. Not, at least, in <i>this</i> city. Why should he choose now, this investigation in particular, to come out of the woodwork?<br><br>But this was another one to stuff into the ever-increasing file marked <font size="1">QUESTIONS THAT COULD WAIT</font>. "Well, thanks for letting me know. Old Marshall and I are probably due for a few words." Williams straightened up. "Now I'm going to get out of everyone's hair in a minute. But first I'd like to hear you two explain the judge situation to him. If you don't mind? Only because my peace of mind hinges on making sure those detained understand the trial ahead of them."</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Yoshimitsu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Of course," Illiana agreed, stepping up to the bars of the cell. A fractal glowed beneath her feet. That was new. It didn't immediately electrocute or decapitate her, so she chose to ignore it for now. "You know already that this is an all-Power court case, which Justice Staudt's wanted to try for a while now. He's the one who authorised me to be your defense attorney, and for Yoshimitsu to be my co-counsel for one day only."<br><br>"Ah, Yoshimitsu is present, too?" Antonio asked. To answer, Yoshimitsu stepped forward.<br><br>"He's only here for today, and for tomorrow's trial. If it goes on longer, he's not allowed to advise me any further," Illiana explained. "Normally, a co-counsel would be allowed longer, I think?" She looked to Yoshimitsu for confirmation, and he nodded.<br><br>Illiana took a breath, pausing to pick her words.<br><br>"The judge for the case is Justice Staudt, and Yoshimitsu says he's a good man, if too leniant," she continued. "But since this entire case is so controversial, he had to agree to a compromise. His advising judge, Justice Hooper, was the compromise."<br><br>Yoshimitsu took over.<br><br>"Hooper's about as far from Staudt as you can get," he stated bluntly. "Staudt's too leniant on any Powers, but Hooper doesn't just throw the book at them. She's had the book made out of some kind of heavy metal with big spikes and barbed wire wrapped around it. She's a genius, and she's got an intuition for Power involvement in any case."<br><br>"She is an <i>advising judge</i>," Antonio sneered.<br><br>"Don't you get it, Antonio?" Illiana asked. "Justice Staudt can't ignore anything she says, otherwise the entire case gets thrown out. This is a test trial, and if Staudt doesn't conduct himself properly then it gets cancelled, and you get locked up here until another trial comes up. I'd bet anything that, if that happened, you'd be facing Justice Hooper with a defense attorney who can't save you."<br><br>Antonio remained silent, looking at Illiana. His expression was unreadable, though Illiana had known for a while that he was nervous when this happened. Dignity at all times was his way. She was at least somewhat happy to see he was finally taking it seriously. </div></div>

        <h2 class="poster">Yoshimitsu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">As Commissioner Williams walked away, Illiana paused to remember just why she had come to Antonio's cell. There were so many unanswered questions, and she had to wait before questioning either Dacten or Mrs. Odio. Since Antonio was a friend, as well as who she had to represent, she was allowed a little more time than most attorneys would be when visiting their clients.<br><br>"I've got a few questions, Antonio," Illiana started, glancing at Yoshimitsu. Once again, his face was unreadable. Illiana frowned, but didn't linger.<br><br>"Hooper is as bad as you say?" Antonio asked, looking at Yoshimitsu.<br><br>"She's probably worse," Yoshimitsu replied. "I've never met the woman, but I've never met Staudt either. There's a good chance you've got a more even playing field in court, but I wouldn't hope too much."<br><br>"I see," Antonio said, finally regaining his composure. "Then tell me, what evidence have you found?"<br><br>"We looked at the crime scene," Illiana took over, looking over her notes. "There's no blood at the scene, and the murder weapon is too high a caliber for anyone but a trained user to fire. The kickback on it would cause bruising at best, but a dislocated shoulder for most people."<br><br>"What caliber gun was it?" Antonio asked, though Illiana got the impression that he knew too little about guns. To be fair, she didn't know a lot either.<br><br>"Fourty-five," she answered. "Odio was shot in the heart, so death was immediate. We also found a letter from Charles Dacten to the victim, telling him that..."<br><br>"What he was about to do was too risky, and he wasn't thinking about who he could be hurting," Yoshimitsu finished. "Antonio, like Illiana said, we have a few questions."<br><br>"Very well, I shall answer to the best of my ability."<br><br>"Jacob Marshall," Illiana said, waiting to gauge Antonio's reaction. He laughed, a superior, smug laugh. "I take it you know him then?"<br><br>"Detective Marshall is an old rival of mine," The brown haired boy answered, returning to his seat. "It was his life's mission to put the Butterfly behind bars, to a point where he nearly had me convicted. However, a keen eye allowed me to cut a deal with him."<br><br>"A keen eye?" Illiana repeated. "And what kind of deal?"<br><br>"Illiana, you've noticed it too," Antonio stated. "You always were excellent at detecting Powers. How much attention did you pay to his eyes?"<br><br>"You mean..."<br><br>"Yes. Detective Jacob Marshall is a Power. He is a walking lie-detector, even to more subtle forms of deception," Antonio explained, his expression slightly smug. Illiana would have been irritated by that, if she wasn't processing the information. "You can tell when he detects a lie by his eyes changing colour. Smaller lies turn his eyes to a light green colour, while a blatant show make them almost golden."<br><br>"That explains a lot," Yoshimitsu stated, nodding. He stepped up to the bars, ignoring the fractal that appeared at his feet. "They always said Marshall knew how to get the truth out of someone, it's because he could see the lies."<br><br>"After our deal, I heard he went straight to Miss Mangjeol to request her silence," Antonio continued. "I upheld my end of the deal and did not share his secret, and in return he convinced the police that I was framed."<br><br>"Yoon mentioned that she couldn't give me any information on Marshall," Yoshimitsu chipped in, speaking to Illiana. "He arranged to have his secret kept, for a cost."<br><br>"And this was for the Edward Diamond?" Illiana asked.<br><br>"It was," Antonio confirmed.<br><br>"Why was Marshall a suspect in that case?" Illiana queried, trying to piece together the information she needed. "If he told the police you were framed..."<br><br>"I could not let the humiliation pass me by so politely," Antonio stated bluntly, for the first time appearing offended. "The good detective nearly sent me on a permanent trip to prison. In response, I indicated that Detective Marshall's knowledge of the Butterly was because he was, indeed, none other than the mastermind himself. The reason he was in law enforcement was to remove any rivals from the field, and to have a reputable front in public."<br><br>"And the judge believed you?" Yoshimitsu asked skeptically.<br><br>"The judge of the case could not deny the possibility, but no evidence could be presented to support my claim. That was not my intention, however," Antonio explained. "The whispers of the court spread far and wide, and Marshall's reputation was destroyed."<br><br>"... How old were you at the time, Antonio?" Illiana asked. If she was right...<br><br>"I was merely sixteen years old," he answered politely. "A child, who could not allow grievances to pass him by unnoticed. I regret ruining Marshall's career but, as I'm sure you understand, it was a fortuitous move to eradicate an expert detective."<br><br>"I understand, but that doesn't mean I like it," Illiana replied, slightly coldly. "Sometimes I wonder why we're friends."<br><br>"I don't doubt it," Antonio said with a genuine smile.<br><br>Illiana sighed. She had known for a long time that there was no chance in changing Antonio. At the end of the day, he was still self-important and arrogant to a fault. He was definitely not the sort of person she had expected to become one of her better friends. Still, some of the things he said fit together nicely. If everything he said was true, then that could mean only one thing.<br><br>"Thanks, Antonio, we'll be back if anything else comes up," Illiana said.<br><br>"I'm not going anywhere," Antonio replied in a bored voice. Illiana and Yoshimitsu waved as they walked away, the girl eager to discuss this with Yoshimitsu.<br><br>"I know what you're thinking," Yoshimitsu stated with a lopsided grin.<br><br>"Marshall has all the motive in the world to frame Antonio and implicate him in the murder," Illiana said quickly as they walked away from the cell, down the corridor. "It'd explain why he's suddenly interested in this case, because he's had a hand in it!"<br><br>"Maybe, but don't go setting your entire argument on this," Yoshimitsu warned. "There's every chance we're wrong and he's an unfortunate victim."<br><br>"Right..." Illiana agreed vaguely, trying to formulate an argument for the court. <br><br>There was one big problem with the entire case so far, though. If Odio had been murdered, how did the murderer transport the body to the Felice Potabile without being noticed?</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Beelzebibble</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Williams emerged from the underground tunnel into the main confinement complex and immediately took a secluded side door, leading him into a tall, narrow passage that would wind around to the Penitentiary's entrance without bringing him within view of any of the ordinary human prisoners' cells. It wasn't that the Commissioner was too cowardly to face the orange-clad masses. Not at all. Only that he anticipated placing a phone call very shortly and their howls and jeers would have made that conversation an entirely unnecessary pain in the ass.<br><br>He steadied himself against the white wall as a loose floor tile slid underfoot, barely even aware on a conscious level of the momentary lapse in balance. The conversation in SC-4 had given him too much to think about. Jacob Marshall for a start -- but that was secondary. For investigation later. Sharpe was the one under the lamp. And Williams was beginning to get some funny ideas about Sharpe.<br><br>Granted, he was a little disappointed that the Hooper gambit had fallen through. Or, at least, come up short. He'd been hoping to usher Ms. Silna into making some reassuring remark like "...but on the other hand Staudt is really <i>nice</i> to Powers so I bet he'll go easy on you!" Some more definitive tipoff that Sharpe really <i>was</i> a Power and that they weren't wasting their resources keeping him in an SC block. But the young lady had chosen her words carefully, and so had Mr. Yoshimitsu. Assuming, of course, that the Butterfly was a Power, Williams had been unable to find anything in either of their comments to betray that Sharpe might be out of the ordinary as well. Tough luck. At least it meant he didn't have to feel bad about taking advantage of their naivete. Maybe Sharpe had picked Ms. Silna for a reason after all.<br><br>But that was yet another <font size="1">QUESTION THAT COULD WAIT</font>, and if Williams sensed himself maybe getting a little overzealous about stuffing things into that worn and sagging file, it was only because the nugget of information he'd <i>really</i> been struggling to digest in the last few minutes deserved his full attention.<br><br><i>"Don't misjudge, Commissioner, I did not plan a murder. The fact that I have been implicated in this case is due to no fault of my own. Clearly, I was being framed for a crime that has no relation to me."</i><br><br>Now what had motivated that particular choice of words?<br><br>As Commissioner Williams' bulky brown fingers worked the buttons of his cell phone with deceptive quickness, he wondered whether Sharpe really ought to just let Ms. Silna do the talking from then on.<br><br>* * *<br><br>"Yeah, but he probably just means he was framed as an <i>accomplice</i>, right?"<br><br>"I thought of that, too -- that was the first thing I thought of. But look at his story again. Who do you think could possibly have framed him?"<br><br>Inspector Denham Landsvale, who of course did not have the story laid out in full before him to look at again -- who had, in fact, only just now heard the story secondhand from his superior -- nonetheless had a ready answer, and hesitated only to draw in a sudden half-yawn before responding.<br><br>"The Butterfly," he said.<br><br>The reply came back: "Really?"<br><br>"Yeah," said Landsvale, as he spun his office chair gently away from the computer screen and toward the window. "Didn't Sharpe say the Butterfly'd stolen that deal out of his hands? Kind of mad at him after that, wasn't he? Mean, they obviously weren't <i>friends</i>, at that point."<br><br>"So you think," the Commissioner said slowly, "that Sharpe was so pissed off about getting cheated out of the deal that he promptly called up the Butterfly and said 'I am going to run crying to Papa Williams and tell him all about you, you big meanie. Here is the exact location and time where our meeting will take place. And there is nothing you can do about it'?"<br><br>Landsvale blinked. <br><br>"What you're saying is..."<br><br>"What I'm saying is, if Sharpe's story is true, there ain't <i>no</i> way the Butterfly framed him, because there's no way he would've told the guy he was planning to meet me in the first place. He's not that stupid. Hell, <i>anyone</i> tried to frame Sharpe, they'd need to know exactly where he was going to be, and when, and why, and plan the whole murder around that. He can't've told the Butterfly, or whoever was acting as a go-between for them. So who else? Why would Sharpe've told anyone at <i>all</i> about the meeting? He'd have to know how vulnerable that would make him. Why in Christ's name wouldn't he keep it between him and me?"<br><br>"So Sharpe wasn't framed?"<br><br>"Not under that version of the story," said Williams grimly, "not unless he really <i>is</i> the most wretched idiot who ever thought he could look down his nose at me."<br><br>"Then he's lying." A bright blue glint in the corner of the window caught the Inspector's eye, but he knew it was just the reflection of his screensaver turning on. "Fine. We kind of figured that anyway, right? Just back to the original story, huh? He was in cahoots with the Butterfly the whole time."<br><br>"Yeah... that's one thing I'm thinking."<br><br>Inspector Landsvale hesitated. Then he frowned. Next he opened his mouth, but for the second time that day he was interrupted by an arrival. Although this time it wasn't a bunch of guys bustling in with guns but an unintrusive knock on the door. "One sec," he told the Commissioner, and set down the phone.<br><br>As he expected, it was one of the boys from downstairs.<br><br>"Early verdict?" asked Landsvale.<br><br>"It's coming up positive, sir, so far," said the young man. "The length of the signature in the letter matches all the paperwork we have on file for Dacten. We're not turning up anything out of the ordinary as far as pen lifts or ink blots in the rest of the letter. Tremor level is perfectly within bounds, too. Now it's a steadier hand than his usual, but that's to be expected, given the content. If Dacten <i>was</i> the writer, he didn't dash this piece off in a hurry."<br><br>"Sure, sure." Landsvale leaned a hand on the doorframe. "You wrapping up, or you want to keep at it?"<br><br>"Mrs. Torrez is still pulling more old Dacten material out of the library of records. We figure it'll only help to go further back. If the letter <i>was</i> forged, there's no telling how old the document could be that the offender was using as a basis..."<br><br>"But you don't think it was forged?"<br><br>The analyst shook his head. "Sir, if you ask me it's the God's honest. But we'll keep you informed."<br><br>"Right," said Landsvale, and waved him off. He shut the door and picked up the phone. "Commissioner? Early word from the lab is Dacten's letter looks genuine. Gonna keep working on it though."<br><br>"What? Oh." Williams' voice sounded distant, distracted. "Yeah. That's good. Fine."<br><br>Landsvale cleared his throat gently, unsure of how to pick the thread back up. "'D I leave you hanging, earlier? Sounded like you were chewing on an idea."<br><br>"It was stupid. Forget it."<br><br>"Mean, we <i>know</i> Sharpe's not the killer," said the Inspector on a guess, "'less he can fire a gun in the other room with nothing but force of will. Right?"<br><br>"That's right," Williams replied, in a placid tone which nonetheless conveyed quite clearly that this wasn't what he'd had in mind at all. Landsvale let out an abrupt disbelieving breath.<br><br>"Wait a minute," he said. "Commissioner, you're not telling me you think Sharpe—"<br><br>But the other man's deeper voice cut him off. "Oh <i>damn</i>, I was about to forget. Landsvale. Has Jacob Marshall swung by the station?" Hearing Landsvale's hesitant mumble, he added: "Tall, blond, scruffy, <i>mean</i>-looking fucker, and unless he's finally come to grips with reality, probably dressed like he just stepped off a Western set."<br><br>This was more than a sufficient reminder. There was no mistaking the fellow who'd approached Miss Silna at the station. Denham Landsvale, who'd served on the force in Cerulean before his transfer to this department, was no stranger to the Archipelago's subcultures and the visual oddities they spawned, but Marshall's antique outfit and demeanor had come as a genuine surprise. "He was here," Landsvale instantly affirmed. "Ran into him around one, right before the kids and I visited Dacten."<br><br>"Not still there, is he?"<br><br>"Nope."<br><br>"Did he say where he was going?"<br><br>"Not the foggiest."<br><br>"Well, shit," observed Williams. He was silent for a moment, apparently pondering this dilemma. "I tell you what," he eventually continued. "There's someone you need to call. Number's in the phone book. We want to find Marshall and bring him to the station. I'd like to talk to him."<br><br>"Who do I call?" Landsvale asked, and Williams told him.<br><br>* * *<br><br>"Heading out, Commissioner?" asked the reddish-gray-haired fellow at the desk in the lobby.<br><br>Williams nodded, but before he could lay a hand on the door, another thought occurred to him. As long as he was going down this path, he could use something more substantial than his own memory for evidence. He approached Ferguson's counter. "You want to do me a favor? Patch me through to the folks running the cameras. I just had a little parley with Sharpe in SC-4 and I want a log of the conversation."<br><br>"Sure thing, chief," said the old man. "Now I got to tell you, though, the way they copy the disks, you only get about a half hour's footage out of each camera. But you see <i>everything</i> that happened on the block, that whole half hour. All the different angles, you know. Won't miss a trick."<br><br>"Good enough," Williams told him immediately, with an impatient shake of the head.<br><br>"All righty," grinned Ferguson. "Course, as my mother was fond of saying, there <i>is</i> such a thing as good enough, but 'good enough' never is." Which would of course prove to be prophetic once Williams realized, a couple of days later, how short-sighted he'd been at this juncture. But since, for the moment, he believed a half hour's worth of footage was all that he needed, the Commissioner made no attempt to refine his order as the old man picked up the cream-colored desk phone and lifted the receiver to his ear.<br><br>* * *<br><br>A hand dropped the shiny black telephone back onto the hook with perhaps less care than this hand would ordinarily have exacted, but it was uncommon for the hand's owner to conclude a telephone conversation with the level of excitement he now felt. Too often what precipitated and defined his telephone conversations was a bit of bad news: typically notification of some manner of failure on his part, most especially in matters financial. Any shrill, buzzy ring which portended an opportunity rather than an uncomfortable conversation with an accountant was a shrill, buzzy ring which the owner of both hand and telephone positively welcomed into his ears. And here was an opportunity extended by the last organization he ever would have expected to approach him, taking into account their long and storied record of rebuffing <i>his</i> offers of assistance with a singular vigor. <i>Oui, cet apres-midi etait enthousiasmant!</i><br><br>Renard Rouletabille had a murder to solve.<br><br>No, no, that wasn't quite right. It was not his business to determine the identity of the culprit. This was not the request which the Winstone Police Department, in the form of his recent friend the Inspector, had just made of him. But Renard had been allocated a task of no mean <i>signification</i> in itself, no matter how small its scope. He hurried out of the kitchen, nearly tripping for the fourth time that day over the massive form of the Caucasian shepherd left temporarily in his care by another recent friend who was currently overseas. The dog let out a contented sigh and scraped with one idle dinner-plate-sized paw at the divide between the tiled floor of the kitchen and the wooden planks of the living room.<br><br>"Wake up, wake up, Micmac," urged Renard. "We are off to find a detective!"<br><br>No, indeed, the irony had not been lost on the Frenchman. To be perfectly frank it might have struck him as <i>offensant</i> had the Inspector not gone to perceptible lengths to stress the personal knowledge of and investment in the case at hand which this Jacob Marshall possessed. It was these, rather than any generically superior sleuthing talent, which the police sought. And it was Renard's intimate familiarity with the "local haunts", in the evocative words of Mr. Landsvale, which had stirred the police to contact him rather than attempt to guess at Mr. Marshall's whereabouts themselves. <br><br>Micmac unloosed a rapturous <i>baillement</i> and rolled over onto his other side.<br><br>But Renard made no effort to hurry him along, because Renard was not in point of fact certain that he himself was ready to leave the apartment. A nagging sensation informed him that there was a prudent action he would do well to undertake before setting out to locate this Jacob Marshall. As he looked around the living room and at the bedroom door, he made every effort to fill this mental gap.<br></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">~*~*~<i>Winstone Post</i>, 2:40pm~*~*~<br><br>'You know what I miss?'<br><br>'Hm.'<br><br>Editor-in-chief Brat Millsap, all two hundred and eighteen pounds of him, leaned back in his rollaway, tipping the steel-framed chair up on two wheels, ignoring its audacious shriek as the metal flexed violently under his weight. After ten years, he had this particular balancing act perfected. He kicked his feet up onto the hardwood desk, feeling the hollow thump of rubber on oak as they settled into the ever-sinking depression his brogues were slowly working into the desktop. He interlaced his fingers behind his head, careful to avoid the growing bald spot spreading across his graying brown hair and bent the chair further backward, turning his green eyes to the ceiling and beginning the time-honored <i>Post</i> tradition of counting holes in ceiling tiles. <br><br>Across from him, Harris Goodman, copy editor, was engrossing himself in the careful study of Foreign Correspondence's latest attempt at feature journalism. He gave a metered sigh and rubbed a meaty hand across his thick salt-and-pepper beard as he scribbled corrections into the binder, already thick with color-coded tags and wrinkled Post-Its, having passed through many hands before reaching him. It would go back to Foreign for one final revision before Brat looked it over and gave it the A-OK. <br><br>'What do you miss, Brat?' Harris's voice was rich, and always reminded Millsap of that guy from the Aid Africa commercials. He'd never asked Harris to say 'For the cost of your morning coffee...' but he'd always wanted to.<br><br>'What? Oh, you were listening.' The editor-in-chief cocked his head toward Goodman. <br><br>''The providence that's in a watchful state knows almost every grain of Plutus' gold.''<br><br>Brat chuckled. '<i>Tempest</i>?'<br><br>'<i>Troilus and Cressida</i>'<br><br>'Never read it.'<br><br>'Think of it as <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> meets <i>The Iliad</i>.'<br><br>'Just think, Harris. If they'd have taught us <i>Troilus</i> in school they'd have covered two of our biggest required readings. Think of the efficiency!'<br><br>Harris glanced up at Brat, a flat stare that told the editor-in-chief he needed to get to the point. <br><br>Millsap looked back up at the ceiling. 'I miss the rumble.'<br><br>'The what?' Scribbling. Goodman was already back to work.<br><br>Brat sighed. 'You remember, ah, what was it, twenty years ago, we were still running print on typewriters? The old Smith-Coronas. Loudest sumbitches you ever heard in your life.'<br><br>'Yes, indeed. You could hear the composing room from three floors up.'<br><br>'Not just that, Harris. You could <i>feel</i> it. You'd come in on a Saturday before deadline and it sounded like World War III on the floor. This place was alive. You were down in Printing then, weren't you?'<br><br>Harris's beard shuffled as the big man smirked. 'Knee-deep in toner.'<br><br>'See, that's what I'm talking about. Remember when we still <i>had</i> toner? We kept a whole crew of inkboys running between presses to keep the rollers filled. Four guys on graveyard shift to clean and oil the printers, and that was their whole job! We all <i>worked</i> to put out a paper then. It took all of us, blood, sweat and tears. What do you think we had in the eighties, two hundred employees?'<br><br>'Easily.'<br><br>'Now we have sixty-three. Our printing goes out to Kanto now, Chrissakes. They cut our balls off when they subsidized us. Sometimes I feel like we're just pasting Word documents together and calling it a newspaper these days.'<br><br>'Hm.'<br><br>Millsap closed his eyes. 'The <i>rumble</i>, Harris. You used to feel this place moving. It shook you. It felt like progress. We used to pack our news into thirty-six pages and still had to table half our stories for the next day's edition. Now we can barely pull enough workable material to make one day.'<br><br>This time the copy editor did not reply, save for the scritch-scratch of his red ink pen.<br><br>Brat reached for the ceiling and clenched his fists. <br><br>'Good God, whatever happened to the <i>NEWS</i> in this town?!'<br><br>Silence fell over both men, embittered and smoldering. Brat Millsap finished counting holes and began again. Harris Goodman flipped through Foreign's piece and continued annotating.<br><br>Five minutes later, Brat Millsap's prayers were answered.<br></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">~*~*~Saeptum Foundation Site - [REDACTED] PM~*~*~<br><br>Thankfully he had fallen asleep during the car ride. Unfortunately, Julia caught him stirring from said slumber as she slowed her car at this site's first checkpoint. He would be awake soon, and he was one of those few people blessed with the inability to feel grogginess after a nap.<br><br>"Oh hey, we're home already. Sweet. That trip's always so boring, but you always have a way of making the time pass by faster, Jules."<br><br>"You were just sleeping," Julia said. She didn't bother to look at him, though it wasn't out of rudeness. She was looking at the guard outside of her open window and showing her ID. The guard took it, scanned it with a handheld device, then handed it back to her without a smile or a word.<br><br>"You sure it wasn't your hypno voodoo magic shit?"<br><br>"Yes, I'm sure I did not put you into a trance." That was partially a lie. Julia had pulsed the gas in time when they had gotten to the highway, which, combined with the fairly uninspiring drive, might have helped lull Barclay to sleep.<br><br>"Really, because I'm pretty sure I dreamed of you."<br><br>"That's sweet of you to say," Julia said, faking as much enthusiasm as needed to not offend him. He probably didn't actually dream of her. There was an implied wink in the tone of his words. Even if she was in his dream, there was no need to analyze what it might mean. She was one of his main contacts at the Foundation as his therapist, and she was in the car with him. <br><br>As the mesh gate in front of them slid open, Julia took her foot off the brakes and let the car ease forward, touching her foot to the accelerator once the path was completely unobstructed. They drove past several lots of greenspace (the higher ups decided trees and grass were better for morale than a barren flatland reminiscent of a penitentiary), a several story building of glass and concrete growing as they approached. Soon, they descended down a ramp under the building to a parking garage lit by yellowing fluorescent lights.<br><br>Parking wasn't too hard to find, and it wasn't long before the two had made their way into an elevator and out to the site's main lobby. Two armed guards greeted them before the reception at the front desk.<br><br>"I think you know how to get back to your room from here, Barclay."<br><br>"Yuppers. See you tomorrow, Doc," Barclay said while walking toward one of the many similar looking corridors. He did a backwards wave then began jogging down the hall.<br><br>Julia, on the other hand, turned the other direction toward where the technicians' and analysts' wing. Unlike the residential wing which only had cameras along the hallways, the analysts' wing had multiple security checkpoints, complete with pat downs and scans, to make sure nothing was smuggled in or out and to contain any faulty experiments. In fact, in case of emergency, blast doors would seal off the wing from the rest of the facility. Julia even recalled that the walls were reinforced with runed steel, though the security here wasn't even as tight as the containment area. Or so she'd heard. Julia didn't have clearance to even get near the elevator that descended a kilometer into the earth to store all the dangerous artifacts this site kept.<br><br>After the second x-ray of her purse and having to retell how she was bringing a particular artifact in for analysis for the Winstone police department, Julia stood in front of another blonde receptionist., though unlike the one out front, this one was wearing a breather mask hooked up to some air supply under the desk. Julia felt strangely unprotected, even though she knew there were <i>probably</i> no pathogens in the air; all the workers in here were just naturally prepared for some inevitable catastrophe. The doctor approached the desk.<br><br>"Hi, I'm Dr. Julia Romanesco. I was recently at the Winstone penitentiary, escorting Special Operative Barclay Edward Trent for their routine containment assessment, and I was given some evidence by the commissioner that they would like analyzed by our specialists for an upcoming trial." Julia took out her makeshift isolation bag and handed it to the receptionist.<br><br>"If you'll just leave your extension here," the receptionist said, her practiced statement slightly muffled by the breather mask, "we'll call you when we've analyzed this properly."<br><br>"Thank you," Julia said, even though the receptionist was already on the phone calling the relevant parties.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">As always, it was Harris who saw her coming, though his eyes never left his notebook.<br><br>'Heads up. Martinez is on the move.'<br><br>Brat leaned his head over to peek through the glass wall of his office at the composing floor. Sure enough, it was Benita, marching towards him with that distinct Latin authority she always seemed to radiate. The editor-in-chief regarded Goodman with a baffled glare. 'How in the hell do you <i>do</i> that?' The copy editor took in a breath, but before he could deliver another Shakespearean nugget, Millsap stopped him with a raised hand, 'You know what? I don't even want to know. What do you think she wants this time?'<br><br>'Besides your job? Couldn't say.' Harris folded his pen into his binder and closed it. If there was one thing Benita Martinez despised above all else, it was people <i>not</i> paying attention to her. <br><br>As she neared, Brat could hear the militant cadence of her needled stiletto heels stabbing at the worn, waxy tile floor. The feature journalist was every inch of five feet tall, with jet black hair that she kept drawn into a severe bun at all times. She complemented her dark hair, dark eyes and olive complexion with an equally black pantsuit, so dark and so painfully immaculate that Brat could swear light actually disappeared into it. He was also convinced of three equally possible facts regarding Benita's wardrobe: one, that she dry cleaned and pressed the same pantsuit every night for the following day; two, that she owned exactly seven pairs of ink-black pantsuits, and three, that she was in fact the devil or some minion thereof, and conjured the same pantsuit every morning after crawling up from the hellish pit in which she dwelled. As she marched to the door and drew it wide open, sucking the stale air from the cramped office space in a deep, cold breath, Brat hedged his bets on the third choice. 'Morning, Martinez.'<br><br>Harris folded his hands across his lap and fixed his eyes on the dusty corner window. 'Good morning, Martinez.'<br><br>Benita slit her eyes at Millsap. 'Morning, Brat.' It was the furthest thing from a warm greeting as could ever exist. Brat felt her icy eyes boring into him, and knew he needed to make this short, before his soul started pulling away from his body. He noted the manila folder tucked squarely beneath her arm. 'Something for me, Benita?'<br><br>'Something like that.' Martinez whipped the folder from the crook of her arm with such a lightning flourish that Brat almost didn't see her do it. He reached out and gingerly took the folder from her, then, confident that it was now safely away from her and therefore not likely to end up slicing across his throat, leaned back in his chair and opened it. Benita folded her hands behind her back and popped her chin up. 'Been trying to keep an ear on the Odio murder.'<br><br>Millsap started looking through the paperwork. He'd assigned Benita - at her insistence - to the story when it had first broken, but the police had locked the case down air-tight. Even with Martinez's considerable persuasion and resources, she hadn't been able to get past Williams' iron grip on the police departments. There were barely three pages of notes in the folder. Brat looked up at Benita quizzically. 'This is all you have?'<br><br>Martinez bristled. 'Every contact I have is in the dark here. But I managed to find out where they're keeping the suspect.'<br><br>Millsap flipped through the pages, keen eyes scanning every handwritten blurb. 'Special Confinement?' His face lit up in realization.  This wasn't huge news, but it wasn't small time either. The last time they had covered a Power on non-Power killing, it had sparked a moderate backlash in some neighborhoods that had provided them with two weeks' worth of coverage. But was this why they were keeping it quiet? This certainly wasn't the first Power violence in Winstone. 'So the killer - this Antonio Sharpe - is a Power?'<br><br>Benita smirked. 'That's the kicker. They don't know if he is or isn't. There's not really a litmus test for these guys, you know.'<br><br>Brat sat straight up, as did Harris. 'So you're telling me they might have a human citizen in the Special Confinement unit?' They exchanged knowing glances. <i>This</i> was a story. Martinez watched them with bitter satisfaction. 'That would seem to be why they're keeping it all under wraps. The civil rights bulldogs would have a field day.' Benita gestured towards Brat. 'Keep reading.'<br><br>The editor-in-chief peered closely at the rampant scribbles. 'Mildred Hooper? You think she's involved?'<br><br>'Can't be for sure. But she flew back in from Kanto last night. Justice Department's got her name all over Pending Dockets. Maybe she's just coming back off her circuit to sit on the panel, but I'm not convinced - Staudt is by no means overworked, and there aren't any cases up for judicial review.' <br><br>Brat wagged his finger at Harris. 'This... this could be that all-Power court idea we interviewed Staudt about in May. Trial of Powers by Powers? That's huge. Help me remember to pull the notes from Press.' The editor-in-chief closed the folder with a sharp snap and handed it back to Benita, but the feature journalist held her hand up in modest refusal. 'That's not all, Brat. Check the last page. Down there by Denham Landsvale's name.'<br><br>Millsap untucked the third page from the folder and held it up to the light. Martinez had scribbled a brief list of detectives assigned and attached to the case - one of which she had circled in bright red Sharpie. Brat's eyes nearly popped out of his head.<br><br>'Jacob Marshall?!'<br><br>Harris suddenly choked on a breath, thumping his chest as he whooped and heaved.<br><br>Benita smiled coolly. 'I thought you might like that.'<br><br>The editor-in-chief let the page fall from his hands, eyes staring blankly into space. He couldn't believe it. After three years, Jacob Marshall, the Power Policeman, was back on his print desk. He gaped at Martinez. 'This is all fact-checked?'<br><br>'Every bit, sir.'<br><br>Harris coughed loudly and finally interjected, 'Don't lose sight of the story, Brat. This is a murdered policeman, not the exhumation of a long-dead scandal. Better to let this lie until you can get a better grasp of it.'<br><br>Millsap sighed. 'We'll come at it from both sides.' He cut his eyes at Benita. 'The Justice Department has never been watertight. Find a way in.' He handed the folder back. 'This is good work, Benita.' <br><br>The feature journalist leered at Millsap. 'Of course it is.' she murmured as she turned sharply on her heel and marched out the door. As she left, Brat felt as though an enormous weight had lifted off of his chest. He noticed that Harris seemed to be relaxing as well. The copy editor shrugged at him. 'What now, Brat?'<br><br>Brat rested his chin on his fist thoughtfully. 'I don't know for sure yet. But I know there's someone I need to see. How much cash you got on you?'<br><br>Harris rankled. His eyes flashed with recognition. 'Brat, <i>no.</i> Not again.'<br><br>'Come on, Harris, she's always good information.'<br><br>'Damn your nerve, Millsap, she's a <i>snake</i>. We've given her more money than I care to remember, and not once have we broken a story off her consultation. I'm not paying another dime to that wine-soaked charlatan.'<br><br>'Harris.'<br><br>'No. No, no, no.'<br><br>'<i>Harris.</i>'<br><br>'I won't be moved on this, Brat. Not this time.'<br><br>'Harris.'<br><br>The big man grimaced. 'I can take five hundred from the Special Printing account. But not a penny more. And God damn you, Brat Millsap, if you don't return every cent of it before the month is out.'<br><br>Brat clapped his hands together. 'Excellent. Grab your coat. I'll meet you at the car.'</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">~*~*~ 3:00PM Coralstone Road, Winstone City ~*~*~<br><br>Coralstone Road was renowned for the kind of people who lived there. With the houses that had more rooms than could be counted, gardens where a professional baseball team would have more than enough room and cars that were so expensive, cashing one in would feed a starving country for a year, it was little surprise that only the wealthiest citizens of Winstone lived there. It was also a place where police patrols were seen regularly; with such valuable property, it was a target from robbery. Even so, the inhabitants were not discouraged. <br><br>Unfortunately for some people, the residents of Coralstone Road were also usually very intelligent and infuriatingly nosy. It was very rare for a person to even walk up the street without being noticed in one way or another. A twitch of a curtain or a shadow in an upstairs window would move, and suddenly any passers-by would notice that they were being watched. Those who didn't notice the subtle movements would continue, blissfully unaware, but for those who did see the silhouette in the window felt unnerved.<br><br>It had been a scandal, years ago, when a teenager was seen wandering up the drive of one of the houses, pulling out a key, before opening the door and stepping inside. No moving truck. No suitcase. Nothing even indicating the boy was actually moving in. Somehow, he had done smoothly and covertly, the residents all decided. Maybe in the dead of night, some speculated. The boy had been no trouble, however. There was no answer if anyone tried to welcome him to the neighbourhood, and he made no effort to fit in. Other than him leaving or returning to his house at strange hours, there was nothing to complain about.<br><br>Marshall had been very curious about what was inside that house. He had never gotten his hands on a warrant, never been invited inside and never broken in before. Well, the breaking in was about to change. With Sharpe finally behind bars, he was free to finally have a look around in peace. The fences and hedges already in place from the previous occupier of the house gave him enough cover to move in peace, but he had an excuse in case anyone came asking. After all, the population of Winstone still knew him as a detective, even if he wasn't strictly on the force.<br><br>He strode along the driveway casually, each step causing a jangling of his spurs and a clinking of whatever was underneath his poncho. As soon as the hedges shielded him from view, as he walked down the thin path leading to the garden, he reached under the poncho and pulled out a small box. Keeping it firmly in his hand, he turned into the garden and set his eyes on the back door.<br><br>"Alright, pardner, let's see what secrets you've been keeping," he muttered to himself, opening the box.</div></div>

There was certainly no denying that the headline alone of this installment was enough to capture Renard’s attention.<br><br><hr><font size="7"><font face="Impact">MARSHALL GOES SOUTH</font></font>[/font]<br><br><font face="Georgia"><b>BENITA MARTINEZ<br>Feature Journalist</b><br><br>The frenzy in Winstone's police department following the Edward Diamond trial may finally begin to settle: legendary “cowboy cop” Jacob Marshall has withdrawn from his post as the city’s premier investigator and most notorious bloodhound.<br><br>Long plagued by suspicions that his ironclad track record of interrogation and apprehension concealed an undisclosed power, Marshall has faced a newfound rumble of scandal since the remarks made by Antonio Sharpe at the trial eight days ago. Sharpe’s statement, implying that Marshall’s “obsessive” knowledge of the activities of the world-famous criminal known as the Butterfly might betray the truth of the detective’s own identity as the master thief, was received by eager ears throughout the city.<br><br>“This couldn’t have come at a worse time for Marshall,” observed social commentator Catherine Blankenship, though not before registering her opposition to his resignation. While quick to dismiss Sharpe’s utterances as “the incendiary claptrap you expect of a cornered teenager,” Blankenship admitted: “All the same, anything remotely provocative, following so hard on the heels of [ex-Commissioner] Reese’s own Waterloo, was sure to start a wildfire. Push all this forward a year and I guarantee that it would have blown over with no harm to Marshall’s career, but the rumors touched ground just at the department’s most vulnerable hour.<br><br>“People don’t want to trust the Winstone police, these days,” she continued regretfully. “They’re happy to think the worst of Marshall, and they’ll be only too happy to keep doing so now that he’s stepped down. The right response would have been to stay on and for him – for the whole department – to work diligently and regain the city’s faith the hard way.”<br><br>Obliging Blankenship’s assessment, the majority of voices have shown far less remorse for Marshall’s withdrawal than she. Writes a correspondent who wished to remain anonymous: “Do I think he’s the Butterfly? That’s probably a long shot, but it’s not the point. I’m just glad to know that he’s off the force. The man’s always been a troubling figure; his methods and his attitude have put a lot of people on edge. Remember Kinsey? How about Davidson? I’m surprised he hadn’t been fired outright by now, with a history like that. The police don’t need Marshall, and frankly, they’re better off without him.”<br><br>The contributor was referring to two incidents, both within the past four years and featuring fellow officers (Brad Kinsey and Seth Davidson), which cast aspersions upon Marshall’s character. In the former incident, a drug raid turned sour when Marshall’s weapon misfired, causing permanent damage to Kinsey’s arm; rather than fall back and assist his injured man, Marshall ordered Kinsey to “bite the bullet” before rounding up the unarmed drug traffickers. A still more controversial situation unfolded during the capture of Corrado Arpino, a convicted killer with ties to the Giarrettiera circle. While Arpino held an overpowered Davidson at gunpoint, Marshall challenged him with the now-infamous words “Don’t think you’re safe, boy. Don’t for one goddamn second think you’re safe.” If not for the timely intervention of officers Rachel Gould and Miles O’Reilly, it is widely believed Marshall would have opened fire – speculation which the “cowboy cop” all but encouraged in subsequent interviews.<br><br>When asked about these incidents, Blankenship allowed that “prudence has always been a weak point of Marshall’s, menace always one of his foremost strengths,” but maintained: “What matters, with apologies to Messrs. Kinsey and Davidson, is that he got the job done and better than most. I don’t want to believe that Winstone might be a more dangerous place now because of the unfounded accusations of a juvenile delinquent like Antonio Sharpe.”<br><br>Marshall himself was unavailable to comment, as was the department’s recently appointed Commissioner, Perry Williams, who replaced Emerson Reese in August after the latter was discharged on grounds of unethical consultation with third-party information broker Yoon Mangjeol . . . <br></font><hr><br>Renard finished the article at a hasty clip, his brow furrowing further with every paragraph. Now he could recollect with no difficulty his memories of that <i>tumulteux</i> time. It was all too easy to forget how relatively recently Mr. Williams had assumed the post of Commissioner, and that he had stepped into the role at a period of such upheaval. First Emerson Reese, then this Jacob Marshall… Why hold forth with a phone book about the corruption among the politicians, when there had once been very nearly as much malfeasance within the ranks of the <i>gendarmerie</i>?<br><br>To be frank, this was one of the reasons Renard had always at least half-hoped to find employment on the force: to help restore to them some measure of integrity. But in recent years he’d conceded that there was not much need. Perry Williams had by all accounts done an admirable job of cleaning up the department’s activities. There had been no more Marshalls…<br><br>That thought set Renard to rereading the feature with a reinforced care. He had never met Jacob Marshall (nor could truthfully claim that he looked forward to doing so today) but he now remembered enough about the <i>medisances</i> three years ago to notice something amiss in the tone of this article. Yes, there was a point of note to which the <i>Post</i> had paid considerably less attention than seemed its due: the question of whether Marshall was in fact a Power or otherwise. After that second paragraph, the article made no further mention of this subject. Renard was absolutely certain it had been a more heated topic of debate, and a greater factor in Marshall’s fall from grace, than the author allowed. He gave a puzzled glance to the name of the journalist. Mme. Martinez was a familiar name, one he respected as an avid follower of the <i>Post</i>, but this seemed unlike her. Renard did not know the woman to have any pro-Power leanings, such as might have inclined her to drape a veil over the possibility of Marshall’s being one. Perhaps an editorial stroke from some higher rafter in the grand and bustling mills of the <i>Winstone Post</i> had censored any further exploration of the subject?<br><br>If it did no other good, at least this question stiffened Renard’s resolve. Between his original <i>empressement</i> to do well by Commissioner Williams and Inspector Landsvale, and his newfound curiosity as to the issue of Marshall’s Power status, he was firmly intent upon seeking the ex-detective out. Only the recurring motif of gunplay in the article stirred any <i>peureux</i> feelings within him; Renard hoped dearly that when this Jacob Marshall had turned in his badge, the department had seen fit to remind him to relinquish the pistol as well.<br><br>After rolling up this newspaper to take with him, Renard trod lightly over the other stacks in order to exit the bedroom. First to equip himself for the afternoon out, next to line up potential destinations. Where was an ex-officer, who’d returned after several years to the city he had once served, liable to show his face?<br></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Kid was still smart.<br><br>Not smart enough, but still smart. The alarm system in the house was at the back door, exactly like Marshall thought. Normal robber would go for the front door at night, thinking the alarm would be there. Not Marshall, and not Sharpe either apparently. Right next to the back door, but in an alcove. Couldn't see it from outside. Alarms were something of a specialty with Marshall. He slipped the box of lock-picking tools back under his poncho and pulled the front panel from the alarm box in front of him. The mesh of wires underneath would baffle anyone else, but Marshall pulled out the power cable and resealed the system. Even better, his vision hadn't changed so it wasn't a decoy. Safe as houses. Or not, as the case was.<br><br>He glanced around the room quickly. The kitchen wasn't exactly where he expected to find some incriminating piece of evidence, but thoroughness was the key with any investigation. Clean as a whistle and not a single thing out of place, except for a newspaper on the table. He opened the fridge to find nothing but a couple of bottles of water. Probably ate out all the time, at them fancy places that charged a fortune for the house salad. Snobby little brat. He checked the drawers, finding a bunch of general utensils and not much else. Did the kid never use his own house? Probably not. Didn't seem to even need sleep. He glanced at the newspaper again, and the headline caught his eye.<br><br><hr><font size="7"><font face="Impact">MARSHALL GOES SOUTH</font></font>[/font]<br><br><font face="Georgia"><b>BENITA MARTINEZ<br>Feature Journalist</b></font><hr><br><br>Course the kid had this paper out. He was planning something on Marshall's turf, he'd want to be sure he was safe. The detective didn't bother reading the article, he knew what it said already. All 'fallen cop' and 'glad he's gone' and 'power involvement'. If only they knew how useful, how fucking essential he'd been to the force. So what if he got a little rough sometimes? He got the right people behind bars. He even got half of the Powers behind bars if they stepped out of line. Williams and them should be praising him and begging him to come back. Whatever. He got by no problem, found his work where he could. Like that French one, Roulette or whatever his name was. Nice, big reward for a job done. <br><br>Marshall binned the paper (surprised that the kid even had a bin considering he didn't have anything else in his kitchen) and made his way to the hallway. Probably one of the smaller houses on the road, or they were all done up on the outside to make them seem bigger. He climbed the stairs, guessing that the bedroom was the best place to find something suspicious. Got the right door on the first try. Thank Christ for that, he didn't care about what kind of shampoo the kid used. Nice bedroom though. Kingsize bed, wardrobe, chest of drawers, bedside table. Pretty standard, but everything looked fucking pricey. How had anyone not realised the kid was a thief? Where else did he get this cash from?<br><br>Best start somewhere. He opened the wardrobe and started going through the clothes there. Loads of suits, some with the price tags still on. He checked one. Came in at a thousand dollars. Fucking hell. Nothing in any of the pockets, though. He closed the wardrobe and went to the chest of drawers instead. Top few drawers were empty. Bottom one had some papers in it. Couple of receits, couple of maps of cities. He pulled out a stack of envelopes, none of them marked. <br><br>"What've yeh been hidin', 'Tonio..." He muttered, opening the first envelope and reading the note inside. Typed, not signed, no name.<br><br><hr><font face="courier">Congratulations on not arousing suspicion.<br><br>Payment will be delivered through the usual means.<br><br>My associate will be at the Felice Potabile at 8:00pm on Thursday.</font><hr><br><br>So the kid <i>was</i> usually engaged in partnerships. He checked a couple more letters, but they were mostly the same. The last envelope he picked up felt heavier, the shape a bit wider. Something more than a letter was inside. He opened it and let a small bracelet fall into his lap. Pretty understated, silver or maybe white gold, a couple of sapphires. He checked the envelope again and pulled out another note.<br><br><hr><font face="papyrus">A token of affection for orchestrating such a successful demerit of an upstanding member of the law enforcement. Marshall has been run out of town by critics and Power hating citizens. <br><br>However, you are becoming a liability. While you may not have shown me your face, rest assured that I will find you. Your arrogance has gone too far.</font><hr><br><br>Now that was interesting. He slipped both the paper and the bracelet back into the envelope and pocketed it, along with several others. These'd come in handy, he was pretty sure. Better find Miss Attorney and see what she had to say about it.</div></div>

After all Renard was far from the only one to favor this coffeehouse over all competitors throughout Winstone. On weekdays particularly the establishment bore a formidable stream of foot traffic.

At first his assessment was not favorable: the weatherman over the radio had given no indication that the weather would take a turn for the worse, while the calm, clear sky outside further <i>affertit</i> the impression that the rest of Winstone's afternoon and evening would be relatively benign (much more so than the last time Renard had taken a case in hand).<br><div class="quote" author="@pyro" timestamp="1309865538" source="/post/68130/thread"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-23" title="Yoshimitsu" style="border-color: #2119e6;"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v78/Yoshimitsu/yoshi2.gif" alt="Yoshimitsu Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/68130/thread"><abbr class="o-timestamp time" title="Jul 5, 2011 1:32:18 GMT -5" data-timestamp="1309865538000">Jul 5, 2011 1:32:18 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/23" class="user-link user-23 group-12" itemprop="url" title="@pyro" style="color: #2119e6;"><span itemprop="name">Yoshimitsu</span></a></span> said:</div>Maybe some kind of bludgeoning weapon, just in case<div class="quote_clear"></div></div></div><br>However, abrupt thoughts of M. Marshall and his fondness for gunplay changed Renard’s mind. Here there was no call to marvel incredulously at his own power to justify. He merely fetched the umbrella out of the stand and, for practice, gripping with both thin hands the narrow tip rather than the wooden handle, swung the massive black-and-white-striped umbrella at the nearest bookcase and nearly upset a china plate from Belgium which he’d quite forgotten he had mounted up there.<br><br>The weight and striking power were good, but this truncheon was hardly subtle. Between its size and arresting coloration, its presence would be easy for any potential assailant to notice and account for. Renard suspected he’d be well served by some more easily concealed means of self-defense. Therefore he hied himself once again into the kitchen and retrieved a small yet capable serrated bread knife from the cutlery drawer.

Renard observed this movement with a renewed sensation of mild concern. In the first couple of weeks that the dog had spent under his care, Micmac had reacted to Renard’s every word and gesture with rapt, enthusiastic attention. But the time intervening had seen a distinct degeneration in the dog’s behavior, although a degeneration toward two poles at once if such a concept made sense: Micmac now divided most of his moments between uncontrollable rowdiness and nonchalant lethargy. The development troubled Renard, who had made every effort to follow the instructions first left to him by Mlle. Keigler and further explicated in their correspondence since then. In truth, it was clear she had some knack which he couldn’t match.

Keigler in her Newfoundland residence. “You got to <i>tell</i> him first,” she’d urged, when Renard had complained that the dog would tackle him whenever it was time to go outside. “Get the idea in his head. Lay out the mission. Cause if the first thing he hears is the rattle of the leash, he’s gonna go nuts.”<br><br>“Micmac,” Renard announced very clearly, “we are going out!”<br><br>The dog blinked up at him, then trotted into the kitchen to poke his snout at the empty dish on the floor.<br><br>“Out, Micmac,” Renard insisted. “We are going out around town for a while. Outside. Ah... outdoors?”<br><br>The dog took a few laps from the bowl of water by the refrigerator.<br><br>This was a waste of time. Renard plucked the bright green leash off its hook next to the living room door. Immediately Micmac sprang into life, bounding in from the kitchen and barking loudly. His tail wagged with such vigor that when it struck the bookcase it nearly toppled the Belgian china plate again. With difficulty, and while incurring an unseemly dusting of canine slobber, Renard affixed the leash to the Caucasian shepherd’s collar. He had no sooner tucked the massive black-and-white-striped umbrella under his arm and twisted open the doorknob than Micmac wedged his nose into the two-inch gap and applied such force as to fling the door wide open. As he charged out into the hallway, nearly upsetting the <i>Strelitzia reginae</i> in his wake, Renard locked the apartment door in a winded huff. As much as he enjoyed the companionship Micmac offered, Renard couldn’t quell a distinct feeling of <i>soulagement</i> that his term with the animal was only temporary and that Mlle. Keigler would in time relieve the detective from these duties.<br><br>“Be a little while, honcho. I’ve got a couple deals cooking up over here. Few gigs to run for some friends of mine. These irons gotta be red-hot before I pull ‘em out of the fire. But I’ll be back to take the monster off your hands soon as I can, Rules. Don’t break him in the meantime!”<br><br>Yet Renard had never yet been able to confirm what Mlle. Keigler’s long-term plans for returning to the Archipelago were: whether she would simply pass through to pick up Micmac and his effects on the way to elsewhere, or set up camp once again in Winstone. It was this second possibility which unnerved Renard, not for his own sake but for hers. So far he hadn’t confessed the truth to her, that he had sold the knowledge of her Power to pay off his debt to Mme. Mangjeol. The prospect of admitting this frightened him. He understood full well what it would mean to Mlle. Keigler, and what she would think of him afterward. Perhaps if she simply visited Winstone to retrieve Micmac and then departed, she would never have to find out…<br><br>Then these thoughts were swept off by the whir of chain and pedals as the Frenchman on his bicycle raced <i>le chien enorme</i> down the slope to the intersection at the foot of the hill.<br><br>* * *<br><br>Once he had secured both vehicle and Micmac outside the entrance to Demitasse, a heavily-breathing Renard paused to gather his bearings before venturing inside the shop, where, of course, the panoply of inviting aromas took his breath away again. He made a swift inventory of the plush seats and high tables in search of a Stetson hat and poncho, but no such items presented themselves, nor any man fitting the physical description offered by the Inspector. Fine: M. Marshall was not here. It would have formed too contrived a convenience otherwise. But just suppose he had been by earlier…?<br><br>After spending his due two minutes and forty-seven seconds in line, Renard reached the counter, where an unfamiliar barista awaited him with a brisk word of welcome. Keenly predicting that “the usual” would go over poorly with a new employee, Renard spelled out his order of a Café Noisette, shy on the cream, with a dash of toffee in just so many words.<br><br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler8781782').toggle();if($('#spoiler8781782').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler8781782"><i>OOC: Barista, anyone?

        <div class="content"><div class="message">~*~*~3:30 PM, Winstone Police Department Headquarters~*~*~<br>Click, click, clickclick, click. Nopcsa's dress shoes beat a sharp rhythm on the tile floors of the Winstone Police Department. The building itself was nothing inspiring, a squat utilitarian construction with no real elegance or innovation to its design. It felt like a holdover from the early eighties, Nopcsa mused to himself, as his upward gaze fell upon the dingy tiles of the hanging ceiling. Really, though, it seemed EVERY government installation was a holdover from the Reagan years. They all had that same boring smell, the scent of old coffee and fresh ink, with that slight bouquet of allergy-aggravating dust to round it out.<br><br>His transit here had been uneventful, one long slog of a commute. The mindreader had missed out on the in-flight drinks, but Mr. Hajdu was... far from a teetotaler, to say the very least. From the angry buzzing inside his gourd, it was clear that the attorney had considered his vacation to have been wrongfully terminated, and had proceeded to sublimate his anger into a furious pummeling of his liver.<br><br>This had proven both a boon and a hindrance for Nopcsa. Though it loosened up his subject's brain, making it easier to tease thoughts out of the deeply nested tangle, it also meant everything was blurry and uncertain, as if looking through a warped lens. He still wasn't copacetic about a few key points, which he'd definitely have to brush up on by tomorrow. For example, say, if mindreading was permissible as evidence in court, or if he needed some kind of special warrant, or...<br><br>The young man sighed, and rolled his eyes. It almost felt like he'd been the one two-fisting overpriced drinks the whole way home, from how fuzzy his thoughts were. Legalese was not a comfortable area for him, honestly. In fact, Nopcsa and the word Legal weren't even on speaking terms these days. To be forced to operate within the constraints of this system... Nopcsa felt like he was a songbird, his wings bound as he was shoved into a maze by a bunch of dispassionate researchers. He was equipped with the tools to end the situation in a matter of moments, but was presently forced to wander through a bunch of dead end hallways.<br><br>And that was where his thoughts led him back to the present situation. He had arrived at a door with frosted glass, bold block letters declaring it to be the office of "Commissioner Perry Williams". Unlike the rest of the dreary building, the writing seemed fairly fresh, yet to begin fading back into the general aesthetic of the place. A mental murmur, much like a lawnmower failing to start, from beyond the door caught Nopcsa's attention, and snapped him back to reality. <br><br>Commissioner Williams. Oh, <i>joy</i>. Nopcsa had, for the most part, avoided the pugnacious policeman's unfortunate involvement in the Ansonia Incident, but he still knew his reputation well enough. The stories got bandied about in headquarters quite often.<br><br>An operative caught carrying a bundle of harmless wands, a variety typically used for shortcutting household errands like scrubbing the floor or such. The Winstone Police force had bagged him for Illegal Trafficking of Firearms, and managed to get the poor schmuck ten years in prison. <br><br>Another one, merely present in a neighborhood when an old house caught on fire, spent two weeks in special containment. They let him go, but only after figuring out that it was faulty wiring, and not the guy that could conjure create clouds of freezing fog, that was the culprit.<br><br>Nopcsa frowned, looking down at his hands. Those two things were small potatoes. They had happened to stupid newbies, idiots who deserved what they got for wandering through Winstone. The only reasonable way to approach this city was <b>Get In. Get Out.</b> Any power that loitered around here for even a second longer than that was asking for trouble. He was NOT somebody who sought vengeance for his comrades. Low level operatives were expendable, that was the name of the game. The only things that got to Nopcsa personally were the things that got to him <i>personally</i><br><br>Really, his grievance sat with the corpulent poseur behind that door. When shit had gone down at Ansonia, the police response had been... Uninspiring. The law had been less than eager to jump to the defense of the Giarrettieras, and once they found out about the involvement of Powers-<br><br>From that point on, it seemed to Nopcsa that they had essentially stopped trying to help out at all. These men, with their bulletproof vests and their arsenal of weaponry, had left them to fend for themselves in a life or death struggle. Maybe if every one of them had been Rie or Helen or whatever, that would've been fine and dandy. As it was, though... Nopcsa, Terrian, and Alyssa were in the trenches, trying desperately not to die, while this prejudiced prick sat safely out of harm's way and threw them to the wolves. As if the power to read somebody's mind would give him the advantage in a raging gun battle...<br><br>Ah, well. <i>Fuck it.</i> He wasn't here to be dreary and reserved. Just by being here, he was playing enough of their stupid games. If these bigots wanted Nopcsa here, they'd get enough Nopcsa to last them a lifetime.<br><br>He straightened his collar, making sure the iridescent embroidery fell perfectly even. He ran his fingers along his lapels, making sure they were just-so.  He looked down at the papers he'd been cradling against his side. They were in order; that would never do. He intentionally shuffled them around, making sure to put his approved form at the very bottom of the stack. Though the temptation to fold it into an airplane and fling it directly into Williams' face was powerful, Nopcsa managed to resist. Williams would have a gun, and most likely, he'd consider any sudden movements at all to be an attempt on his life.<br><br>Nopcsa placed his hand on the doorknob, and turned it slowly, deliberately. Giving a slow, gentle shove, he set it coasting open, and then ducked out of sight behind the door frame.<br><br>"Good afternoon, Commissioner. I'm the prosecutor that was requested to deal with the Odio case."<br><br>Nopcsa couldn't SEE Williams, but his thoughts were clear. <i>Who the hell is this clown, and why isn't he stepping in yet?</i> Oh, an explanation would be furnished.<br><br>"Don't bother looking around for me. I'm invisible."<br><br>Of course, Williams probably already knew that Nopcsa was bullshitting. That didn't matter to him in the least. He was going to show this man <i>exactly</i> the amount of respect that was due him.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Pause. Rewind. The indistinct monochrome figure stood up again out of the chair and walked backwards toward the bars, As he turned, his face took shape once more, mouthing in reverse. Williams dialed the volume up still further before pressing play. The boy turned around and walked toward the chair.<br><br><i>"It was his life's mission to put the Butterfly behind bars, to a point where he nearly had me convicted. However, a keen eye allowed me to cut a deal with him."</i><br><br>Pause. Rewind. Play.<br><br><i>"It was his life's mission to put the Butterfly behind bars, to a point where he nearly had me convicted."</i><br><br>Under his breath, Williams spoke the words in tandem with the boy. And then a few words of his own: "Come on, throw me a <i>bone</i>, here."<br><br>Damn well the Commissioner knew this wasn't going to hold up in court. "He wanted to arrest the Butterfly, therefore he nearly convicted me" did not reduce algebraically to the confession Williams wanted. That statement would carry through just as logically if Sharpe were a lackey of the Butterfly's. Or if he had any association with the Butterfly whatsoever. Or, come to that, if Marshall were such a single-minded maniac as to push his Butterfly vendetta onto <i>any</i> small-time crook he could lay his mitts on. Which fit pretty comfortably with what Williams remembered of Marshall.<br><br>But none of these alternatives held as much sway with Williams as the infuriating certainty that Sharpe was holding something back.<br><br>He let the tape continue playing forward into the discussion of Marshall and Sharpe's history -- Mangjeol, the Edward Diamond -- and rewatched this with a numb half-interest. He had no reason to doubt that Sharpe was telling the truth here, that the "cowboy cop" really had been a Power all along, but by this point Williams'd already gotten the shock and awe at that discovery out of his system. During the scant half-year or so that they'd both worked in the department, the Commissioner had always preferred to distance himself from the detective. To Williams' mind, his senseless predecessor Reese had been the one to hire Marshall, and the one responsible for his particular unconventional shortcomings. That Marshall had breached ethics by using his own little means of lie detection, utterly resistant to empirical testing, was just another nail in the coffin.<br><br>Williams had been only too glad when Marshall had handed in his resignation. He didn't need a wild card like that screwing with his career as Commissioner. And he sure as hell didn't need the wild card back on the table now.<br><br>Then the office door opened. Williams paused the recording and looked up from his computer, half-expecting to see Rouletabille and Marshall stroll in at that very moment -- but no, that would've been an unrealistically quick turnaround. Actually no one appeared to be standing there. Williams hesitated for a moment, briefly questioning the integrity of the new stainless-steel ball lock he'd recently had outfitted, before a voice from the hall piped up.<br><br>"Good afternoon, Commissioner. I'm the prosecutor that was requested to deal with the Odio case. Don't bother looking around for me. I'm invisible."<br><br>Williams slumped in his seat and looked at the clock. Christ, he'd forgotten about this one.<br><br>"Tell that to the laser frames every twenty feet in this building," he said loudly. "Beams pick up something the cameras don't, and this whole place goes into lockdown."</div></div>

It was also going to be his last. His manager told him yesterday that things just weren't working out and that Alan should find work elsewhere. The verdict didn't bother Alan at all since he'd hated every minute he spent in the coffee shop.<br><br><i>Jesus, who really gives a shit about coffee, anyway? It tastes like rancid nut sweat unless you load it up with diabetes-level amounts of sugar and it blasts your breakfast out your asshole at the speed of sound.</i> <br><br>He had already forgotten what the man at the counter had ordered but it didn't really matter because he had never learned any of the recipes for the drinks, nor did he fully understand how to work the machines. His hours at the Demitasse had been spent sweeping the floors, cleaning the bathroom, and stealing from the tip jar. He was only working behind the counter today because two of the capable employees had called in sick and the manager was desperate.<br><br>Alan pulled a few levers and the machine reluctantly spat a thick black syrup into a cup. He stirred in some skim milk to lighten the color and topped it all off with some whipped cream because he remembered the man at the counter had specifically said something about cream. Alan grabbed a saucer and slid the concoction across the counter to Renard.<br><br>"Here you go, boss. Next!"</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Brat wheeled into the Demitasse parking lot, narrowly missing a checkered cab that came around the corner on two nearly-flat wheels, careening past the coffee shop like a tri-colored bullet. Millsap laid on the horn and shook his fist out the window. Deafening Turkish synth-pop dopplered away as the cab slipped behind the next corner, and the senior editor threw the sedan into park. "You believe these idiots on the road?" he shot at Harris, whose eyes were fixed on something beyond the hood. "Never mind that, Brat.

In a span of time uncharitable to any potential escape route, the heavyset visitor had concluded Renard's transaction with a few warm words and steered him forcibly around to march away from the counter.<br><br>It was of course M.

Fortunately Millsap did not appear to notice this, as he was signalling to a new arrival that he should pick up the lattes from the counter. This bearded personage Renard recognized immediately as M. Goodman, copy chief of the <i>Post</i>; though the two had never previously met, Renard knew an employee of that beloved journal when he laid eyes upon one.<br><br>M. Millsap rounded back upon Renard with a smile that was unsettlingly easy to diagnose. Friendly though the editor-in-chief genuinely was, Renard could not deny that the sight of him inspired a certain <i>crispe</i> tension. In their interview after the case of the burgled Boullogne, more than half of what the detective had told Millsap had been lies feverishly concocted in order to disguise Mlle. Keigler's guilt. In the English idiom, Renard had been a "nervous wreck" from the opening handshake to the final wave goodbye. It would not have bothered him terribly if he'd never encountered the affable fellow again.<br><br>At least this time he carried nothing but the truth, but very little of that. If M. Millsap had taken the impression that Renard was working with the police in an <i>official</i> capacity, then, well... then he would have to set that misconception straight, Renard firmly reminded himself. And as quickly as possible; every minute here was a minute that M. Marshall might spend drifting further away into obscurity.<br><br>"What a pleasure, <i>monsieur!</i>" he put together, aware of sounding rather like Mme. Mangjeol.

He withdrew his right hand from his pocket, as if to shake hands with the Commissioner, though the gulf of paperwork and a few steps of distance separated them.<br><br>"That's very..." Nopcsa's tone was thoughtful, almost betraying a note of pleased surprise. As Commissioner Williams grudgingly leaned forwards to extend a hand in greeting, Nopcsa's fingers curled into a fist. His index finger remained level, pointing accusatorily towards the officer.<br><br>"Quite frankly, that's very <i>cute</i>, Perry," Nopcsa didn't shake, and drew away, lowering his hand. He put his other hand on the back of a chair, rumpling his fistful of official looking papers, and turned it sideways to the face of the desk. He melted into the seat with an overwrought sigh, only turning his head partway to glance over his shoulder at the much larger man.<br><br>"Of course I'm not invisible. That would just be silly, after all. What use would an invisible prosecutor be? I'm sure we'd have dozens of accusations about him not even being there, that some ventriloquist was making a mockery of the trial. No, that would just be stupid," Nopcsa spieled off, talking over any attempts to greet him the Commissioner made. He turned his chair again, the legs scraping on the floor. Another loud exhalation accompanied him leaning, as he bent his back over that of his seat. He met Williams' gaze despite his upside-down orientation, and then continued speaking.<br><br>"However, right then and there... I just proved that had I been a malicious power with an invisible <i>gun</i>, you would've been dead," A few locks of Nopcsa's dark hair fell out of place, dangling freely 'above' his head.<br><br>"This is all rhetorical, of course. I have no reason to shoot you, and much more importantly, you have no reason to shoot <b>me</b>," Nopcsa clarified, his tone brightening considerably before growing fatalistic again, "Nonetheless, I hope you can understand exactly why having you amateurs handle this case concerns me."</div></div>

He made it through <i>one, two, ten</i> and called it a noble effort. His gaze momentarily passed to the semiobscene sight of the prosecutor's Adam's apple, exposed, in this contrived position, from behind the stupid cravat. Williams entertained a brief notion of reaching out and throttling the prosecutor's skinny neck. He supposed he could do it with just one hand while leaving the other one free to draft a letter of contemptuous apology to Bartholomew Staudt. But on the whole it'd be tidier to take things one murder at a time.<br><br>"I see," he said at length, "that I can add you to the list of people who're just so <i>eager</i> to impress me with their devil-may-care attitude, they forgot to give a goddamn whether or not we bring in Larry Odio's killer."<br><br>He glanced briefly at the Post-It note on the frame of the monitor, where he'd carefully inscribed the prosecutor's bizarre name; his document on the man was buried too deep on the desk to gracefully retrieve at the moment. A goon from some artifact dealers called the Fascere Order, if he remembered right. "So, Mr. Nopcsa, let me say this very clearly, because I'm sure it's hard to hear just now with all the gallons of fruit bat blood rushing to your brain. I didn't appoint you.

It’s like every month or two, some new danger or crisis happens, and each time, you fuck it up!” Though Nopcsa’s words were harsh, his tone was elated. His eyes tracked the Commissioner’s, meeting his gaze directly. They lacked any sympathy whatsoever, glistening with sadistic glee.<br><br>“And that is <i>why</i> you<i>need</i> me, Commissioner. You might hate me down to a cellular level, but I can turn this all around for you,” Nopcsa’s arm pulled away, leaving him leaning directly over the desktop.<br><br>“They didn’t just pick me for shits and giggles, Commissioner. They picked me because I’m the best possible man for the job.” <br><br>“If I seem carefree, Commissioner, it’s only because I already know we have this in the bag,” Nopcsa laced his fingers together, finally setting down his paperwork, “Bring in Larry Odio’s killer? Commissioner, please.”<br><br>“Not only am I going to convict this delinquent, but on top of <i>that</i>, I’m going to serve you 'The Butterfly' on a silver platter.”</div></div>

And includes two words' worth of autoing, sorry.</i></div><br><br>There was no use pretending the prosecutor's words didn't sting the Commissioner deeply, though maybe they would have caused more pain if these weren't things he'd already told himself a thousand times over, on his own time. All the same, hearing that kind of talk in someone else's voice added a fresh layer of injury. So did the sheer <i>fluency</i> with which the prosecutor spoke, though Williams could be sure he'd rehearsed every line of it on the way in. He sat with head bowed, fists clenched at either corner of the desk, and glared up from beneath his brow; and when Mr. Nopcsa finally arrived at an appropriately self-important conclusion, Williams released his breath for the first time in thirty or forty seconds.<br><br>"Missed the memo, did you," he said.<br><br>He reached for the document Mr. Nopcsa had deposited on the desk, smoothed it out with his palm, and read:<br><br><hr><font face="Optima,Georgia"><b>NAME:</b> Nopcsa (pseudonym)<br><br><b>AGE:</b> 22<br><br><b>OCCUPATION:</b> Antique-dealer under Fascere Order<br><br><b>POWERS:</b> Mind-reading<br><br><b>INTRODUCTION TO CASE:</b> Request issued to Fascere Order, was selected by employer</font><hr><br>And so on. Nothing major of interest that Williams hadn't already learned from the preliminary dispatch, except for that much-beloved signature at the bottom:<br><br><hr><font face="Optima,Georgia"><b>APPROVED BY COUNCIL MEMBER:</b></font> <font size="4"><u><font face="Monotype">Bartholomew Staudt</font></u></font>[/font][/size]<br><font face="Optima,Georgia"><b>DATE:</b> <u>xx/xx/xxxx</u></font><hr><br>"I guess no one told you why Staudt greenlit your employer's choice. Never crossed your mind? Hmm?" And Williams spread his hands wide in a mock display of soul-searching. "I mean, unless you've just never heard of Justice Staudt before. But I can tell you why he'd round out his little all-Power court by fielding a damn mind-reader on the prosecution. You're a figurehead.<br><br>"You're a fucking <i>gesture</i>.<br><br>"You're there to shut the crowd up. That's all. Like Hooper, minus any actual authority. Jesus, you really never stopped to question the fact that Staudt, Bartholomew Staudt, signed <i>you</i> on for prosecution and some know-nothing kid off the street for defense? He's pretending to stack the deck against himself, and you're his flunky! But here's the kicker." Up until the last instant Williams hadn't been sure whether he was prepared to go down this route, but he now found himself speaking with greater confidence in this opinion than he earlier could have admitted. "That greenhorn you're up against? Illiana Silna. Remember that name. She's got more integrity in her little finger than twenty of you worthless mercs."<br><br>He punctuated this with a demonstrative jab of his sausagelike pinkie finger.<br><br>"Sharpe's a prick and the Butterfly deserves a life sentence, but I have faith in Illiana Silna. I believe she's here to do what's right. You? Here to swagger around and earn a quick buck. That's what makes you powerless. Five minutes in the courtroom and you could have the whole case blown wide open but you are nothing -- nothing -- without credibility. Say you know who killed Odio? I don't care. Figured out what this punk's got to do with the Butterfly? Write it to your mother. Why the fuck should anyone believe what you say? You're a hack. You're a <i>Fascere</i> goon, and <i>we are not interested in your help.</i> If you think Staudt put you in play for your stunning insights then you are fucking insane. Just prance around the room and make him look good, why don't you, and see if he pays any attention when you tell him what you saw in Sharpe's... in Sharpe's..."<br><br>The prosecutor never blinked. His smile widened by a hair's breadth. He said, very softly: "Go on?"<br><br>But Williams had taken in a sudden breath. A thought had struck him, and then a mob of other thoughts all crowding in for attention. The first thought, which opened the gates, had been: <i>He's a mind-reader.</i><br><br>There followed every thought the Commissioner did not wish to think. Firstly, yes, his repeated indictments of his own failures and insecurities, which he now could tell had been only too easy for Mr. Nopcsa to draw out and paraphrase. These were joined by a surge of codes, strings, passwords and combinations; a complete inventory of the items held under 24-hour surveillance in the station's vault, and the name and shifts of the officer on that duty in whom Williams placed the least trust; every establishment in Winstone known to be under Don Giarrettera's thumb, and the names of those owners who had agreed to furnish the police with information on the mob's day-to-day business in exchange for protection; the phone numbers to the private hotlines of three dozen police agencies aligned with various nation-states of the UN; the power Wiliams himself most often daydreamed of using when he was a boy in America; a near-verbatim transcript of the letter from Dacten to Larry Odio. All intermixed with a slurry of images: mopping vomit off the floor of Courtney's bedroom; Alicia in tears after he had nearly screamed at her for dismantling, in fifteen minutes of apparently cold-blooded animal purpose, the model train town in the cellar; Monica drawing him close, kissing his cheek and whispering past his ear in the darkness, six months ago at the least...<br><br>"Get out," said Williams.<br><br>The prosecutor smiled at him.<br><br>"I said get out of here <i>get out</i>," Williams roared, and with a sudden motion he barrelled up from behind his desk, seized Mr. Nopcsa's pencil-thin arm, and wrenched him toward the door. "Hey!" the Commissioner barked, and in another instant three officers from down the hall had gathered in the doorway. The closest of them went for her gun.<br><br><br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler4734461').toggle();if($('#spoiler4734461').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler4734461"><div class="quote" author="@pohatufan1" source="/post/71774/thread" timestamp="1342634494"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-10" title="Beelzebibble"><img src="http://s28638.storage.proboards.com/3328638/a/DQ7bJ6Gp3mCoPK2bkorF.png" alt="Beelzebibble Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/71774/thread"><abbr data-timestamp="1342634494000" class="o-timestamp time" title="Jul 18, 2012 8:01:34 GMT -5">Jul 18, 2012 8:01:34 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/10" class="user-link user-10 group-5" itemprop="url" title="@pohatufan1"><span itemprop="name">Beelzebibble</span></a></span> said:</div>And Williams spread his hands wide in a mock display of soul-searching.<div class="quote_clear"></div></div></div></div><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler2925968').toggle();if($('#spoiler2925968').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler2925968"><div class="quote" source="/post/69179/thread" timestamp="1316744162" author="@ninety"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-66" title="Ninety"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/y5MlxQ8.jpg" alt="Ninety Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/69179/thread"><abbr class="o-timestamp time" title="Sept 22, 2011 16:16:02 GMT -5" data-timestamp="1316744162000">Sept 22, 2011 16:16:02 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/66" class="user-link user-66 group-0" itemprop="url" title="@ninety"><span itemprop="name">Ninety</span></a></span> said:</div><img src="http://i52.tinypic.com/288tt3s.jpg" style="max-width: 100%;"><div class="quote_clear"></div></div></div></div></div></div>

The bell tinkled above the door; Harris was coming in. They made eye contact, and Brat made a quick gesture towards the barista, who was setting two cardboard-ringed cups on the counter. Goodman took the cue and went to retrieve them. The editor turned back to Rouletabille. A notepad and pencil had somehow appeared in his hands.<br><br>"Just out doing a little research, thought I might pick your brain a bit about the case - I know a sleuthing mind such as yours has been watching the details closely. An 'expert opinion' column would be just the ticket for tomorrow's byline.<br><br>By then Harris had reached their table and quietly took a seat, setting the latte in front of Brat. He took a casual sip and flipped the pad to a clean sheet.<br><br>"So let's start with the Butterfly. In your opinion, do you think he did it?"</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Beelzebibble</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">An "expert opinion" column? Renard nearly blushed, all considerations of time <i>evaporant</i> in a trace. Obviously it would not be the first time his words had managed to find some inroad to the <i>Winstone Post</i>, yet to have an entire column dedicated to his musings -- That would be a decades-old dream come true--! But Renard mustered his humility. Whatever his faults, this was a man well in control of his ego. And so he responded: "Oh, no, M. Millsap, I beg you to put any thoughts of featuring me in such a column from your mind. I am no expert in this case! Indeed I can hardly imagine I know very much more than you do. Nevertheless, if you feel compelled to quote me in some inconspicuous paragraph tucked away somewhere, I may be able to offer an opinion..."<br><br>He sipped the alleged Cafe Noisette, fought back a ghastly wince which he hoped should have been hidden by his moustache, and offered the following.<br><br>"The Butterfly and I, if I am not mistaken, share a trait in common: we are both of European stock. So, at least, I have been given to understand, for the Butterfly's inaugural thefts took place in Britain, and he spent his early career flitting about the continent before fanning out to new expanses. Now, sirs, I may tell you something about that, having observed much before I arrived here. The legendary criminal of Western Europe is, ah, a beast of a very different cloth" (Renard sensed he was mangling English idioms here, but proceeded) "than comparable figures elsewhere in the world. Our grand outlaws have a certain predilection for <i>showmanship</i>, a tendency toward posturing and to the careful cultivation of style. By comparison, even the highest-ranking villain in the Archipelago, or in America, or elsewhere, is likely to be either a business-minded mobster with his head safely down, or else -- <i>dieu nous en garde!</i> -- a gibbering fiend whose only interest is bloodshed."<br><br>The Frenchman made another heroic effort upon the alleged Cafe Noisette, and thence gave it up. "This Western European model suits the Butterfly very well, you see," he continued, "and I submit the King of Clubs as another example." One which had caused Renard himself tremendous grievance in his own time... but this was a detail perhaps best withheld from the newsmen's ears.<br><br>"As to why this difference should arise, who can say? Perhaps there is something in the fact that America and the Archipelago are young, immigrant societies, in contrast to our deeper roots, our old stories and superstitions. Other masterminds fixate upon opportunity alone, whether for profit or for carnage; <i>our</i> masterminds appear determined to generate some lasting cultural impression. Therefore this element of... well, sirs, of play-acting; this promotion of personae rather like characters from literature.<br><br>"All leading to this observation. The Butterfly has styled himself a semiheroic figure. I am not so sure about that. He purports to steal only from the rich, complacent, deserving, and if I must tell you the truth, I'm afraid I actually find that philosophy quite repugnant. Give me, please, a thief motivated by self-interest alone," (and here he thought again of Mlle. Keigler) "not a moralizing back-alley pundit. However: the Butterfly has thus far made it his tacit creed not to commit murder -- even in scenarios where murdering the victim would have made his burglary considerably easier! -- and I believe that cannot be ignored in this case. I do not say I <i>trust</i> the man, only that if he truly has committed a murder, this would entail a break from his established persona which cannot have come about frivolously. I find it highly implausible he would shed that aspect of his character 'merely' to kill an apparently random policeman. Let me not seem to denigrate M. Odio's memory, but to speculate that the Butterfly would only have felled him with some significant motive, no matter how twisted and cruel. As such, if authority fell to me I would consider it regrettably but absolutely necessary to conduct an inquiry into the person and affairs of Lawrence Odio."<br><br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler5614193').toggle();if($('#spoiler5614193').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler5614193"><i>OOC: <br>Happy birthday to mee<br>I like Renard again whee</i></div><br></div></div>

To be frank, it’s a lot more likely that Poppa Bear over there is going to maul me than vice-a-versa.”<br><br>He put his hands up to either side, level with his shoulders, and gave a noncommittal shrug.<br><br>“My power is mind-reading, and yet you people act like I’m going to summon a dragon or something. Seriously? The very worst I can do is steal your grandma’s secret recipes,” Nopcsa sighed, casting his eyes skywards.<br><br>“Really, pureed kidney beans in the brownies? <i>That’s</i> the best I get out of that one? I mean, that’s just disappointing, buddy,” His glance fell upon the furthest officer, a man with well-groomed sideburns and a strong jawline. The man’s eyes widened for a moment, his lips twitching slightly.<br><br>“Anyways, I’m Nopcsa, the prosecutor for the Sharpe case. I’m on your side, so all this alarmist japery is really a waste of time for everybody involved. If you’d be so kind, it’d probably be for the best if you all just went back to what you were doing. You know, let Williams here resume his spoken word rendition of ‘One Thing’.”<br><br>The mentalist swept his arms to either side, the palms still facing outwards, as if to shoo the officers away.<br><br>“Wait, so you put beans in the brownies and you don’t know about One Direction?” Nopcsa called after the sideburned man, “<i>Philistine.</i>”<br><br>He glanced around again, letting the theatricality drain from his posture. The woman had replaced her weapon in the holster, but she hadn’t taken her hand off of it yet. She was looking to the heavily perspiring Williams for direction. The second officer, a tall Hispanic gentleman, was seemingly having a difficult time deciding between blocking Nopcsa’s path, or clearing the way to usher him out of the building. The third and his facial hair had ambled to the end of the hallway. His posture indicated that he was reading a plaque on the wall, but Nopcsa was certain he was standing by in case things neared their boiling point again.<br><br>“You know what? Just let me just say two things, and then I’ll skedaddle, okay? Then you all can go back to your whole <i>argumentum ad metum</i> deal, and watercooler talks about the viability of tinfoil hats.”<br><br>Nopcsa slowly extended his arm before him, trying to ensure the motion was nonthreatening, and then began using his fingertips to smooth the wrinkles out of his sleeve. With dismay, he noted a few popped stitches near the seam where Williams had seized him.<br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler6395319').toggle();if($('#spoiler6395319').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler6395319">OOC: Not that dramatic of a post, but I figure Nopcsa has to dial down just a bit so that he doesn't get riddled with bullets.

Never once did he look down at his notes.<br><br>"Good, good. Tell me this, though, just for clarity. If you believe that the Butterfly is operating by some stern dictum of 'no killing', and that it would be grossly out of character for him to have done just that, even in a moment of desperation - can we then draw the conclusion that the murder was not only purposeful, but <i>premeditated</i>? The evidence certainly supports that the Butterfly had intent and motive to kill, and was not simply cornered, but this would seem to suggest a much larger degree of forethought into the act itself." More scribbling - Brat quickly flipped to a clean page and began to defile it with scribblings.<br><br>"Investigate Odio? They're doing plenty of that now. Based on what you've just told me, would you agree with those who would suggest that Larry Odio was involved in affairs that might be viewed as criminal, and that those affairs may have been a contributing factor to his murder?"<br><br>This time Harris spoke. "Careful, Brat. Don't lead him."<br><br>Brat chuckled, "Relax, Harris. He doesn't have to put that on the record if he doesn't want to."

Hint: It is the part that caused this post to be delayed by about a month!!!!!!!!!!!</i></div><br><br>Renard shifted slightly upon his stool, relieving the keyring from where it had driven up against his hip. “I do believe the attack was premeditated,” he allowed, “but, gentlemen, we must take care to divorce this question from that of the killer’s identity. Even if the Butterfly was merely framed and had no hand in this crime, nonetheless the evidence continues to favor a calculated murder. Recall the Commissioner’s press statement, and his given reason for arresting Antonio Sharpe: the boy had claimed knowledge of the Butterfly’s doings. You, sirs, know, as do the police, as do I, that it was no coincidence for the murder and the meeting with Sharpe to take place concurrently. Only two hypotheses hold merit: either the Butterfly slew M. Odio while his lackey Sharpe taunted the Commissioner’s incompetence, or else a nemesis of the Butterfly learned of Sharpe’s plan to meet M. Williams, and set a trap to ensnare Sharpe – and, ultimately, he should hope, the Butterfly as well.”<br><br>He paused to tap a few drops of bubble juice into his pipe, lit a match, and was rewarded with a tiny pinkish-gray plume of <i>fumee</i>. Then he remembered his surroundings and glanced toward the counter, at least half-expecting the pockmark-faced employee to bark out an embargo upon smoking, but the youth had disappeared apparently into the backroom, to the consternation of a slowly amassing gaggle of would-be customers.<br><br>“Both avenues require premeditation, but do they both require M. Odio to have been elected specifically as the lamb for sacrifice? As I have already said, if the Butterfly is indeed our culprit, then we should not expect him to have chosen the victim at random. As for the other branch of possibilities? Perhaps this phantom foe of the Butterfly did indeed have some vendetta against M. Odio as well, and saw here an opportunity to… to get blood out of two birds with one stone. Yet we know nothing of this <i>theorique</i> ill-wisher’s principles – such a man might have no qualms about killing indiscriminately. M. Odio might thus simply have been unlucky enough to tread into his machinations at the worst moment…” Renard blew a wisp of smoke before hastening to add, though in a slightly sterner tone of voice, “Now, sirs, you seem to have some idea that M. Odio may have invited his own demise through illicit activity. I can offer no comment on that, nor did I hope to imply such. I never met M. Odio in life, and rumors of wrongdoing on his part never trickled down to me. I have suggested the idea that he did <i>something</i> to attract attention as a target, but this could quite as easily have been a noble deed as a wicked one. If there is any point on which I must beg that you take care not to misquote me, let it be this…!”<br><br>Apropos of begging, a muffled thump punctuated Renard’s words and he saw that the dog Micmac had planted its front paws against the storefront, giving a considerable fright to those patrons nearest the window. The dog ducked its snout against the glass impatiently.<br><br>“Now, sirs,” said Renard, standing up off his stool and picking up the mostly-full cardboard cup, “in response to your last query, I may tell you quite honestly that I have not taken up this investigation in any capacity, official or otherwise. That being said, I <i>am</i> on, ah… something of an assignment, on behalf of the Commissioner. Being that time is of not forgettable import, I hope there is a way for me to ask, without being too impolite, whether we might end this session?”<br><br>* * *<br><br>By making an effort against the tense, seething pulse within his head, Williams kept his voice steady and low. “You want to say two things. Good. I have a new best friend for you. A shoulder to cry on. Her name is Mrs. Eschholz and you two are going to get on like a house on fire. You will go downstairs now, and you will say your Two Things to her. <i>She</i> will give me a call and pass them along, assuming, of course, they’re worth a fragment of my time. You and I will not exchange another god damned word.”<br><br>Mr. Nopcsa nodded, then opened his mouth with a bright expression and a finger raised exaggeratedly. “<i>This one</i>,” Williams told the three officers, quite a bit more loudly, “is under watch. He is not permitted further into the building than the lobby. He will enter the lobby <i>only</i> to speak with Mrs. Eschholz, after which he will do an about face and leave the premises. Should he attempt to move further into the building than the lobby, he will be arrested on grounds of suspected espionage. Should he be seen to loiter anywhere on the premises, he will be arrested on grounds of suspected espionage. I sure hope he’s listening to me right now and not working on his next witty retort but I am not talking to him, I’m talking to you.”<br><br>Commissioner Williams pressed one sturdy hand against the mind-reader’s back and shoved him toward the waiting Ramos and Dunn, each of whom took one of his arms. Williams nodded to Gould, who drew out her gun again for good measure, although since the mind-reader didn’t resist, she did not point it at him.<br><br>“These orders stand indefinitely. Pass them along to the lobby for the time being; I’ll draft a memo. Also, if you get a chance, please thank this man for providing me with a headshot.” Williams jerked a thumb by his side to indicate the paperwork behind him on his desk. “I’m sure he’ll love seeing it pasted on the wall behind the counter.”<br><br>He had enough time to catch sight of the mind-reader soundlessly mouthing words which looked like <i>You’re welcome!!</i> before Ramos and Dunn hustled him away from the office and down the hallway, with Gould at the front. Williams shouted after them: “And if you can’t get an empty elevator, for God’s sake, take the stairs.”<br><br>Then he slammed the door shut.<br><br>After moving about the room slowly and checking the four hidden cameras to ensure that they’d recorded this exchange, he settled down so heavily into his seat as to rattle a clipboard behind his head nearly off its hook. He wanted to lean forward and rest his elbows on the desk, but there was no space to do so without accidentally embossing some stupidly critical document or another. So he instead rolled the chair out a small ways, leaned forward to rest his elbows on his knees, and took stock of his thoughts. The teeming mob had dispersed for the most part, thank the Lord, although there were still a few stragglers kicking around trash on the street. And, in fact, there were several newcomers among them.<br><br>One was: <i>draft that memo yes If You See This Man</i><br><br>Another was: <i>pen ought to call the pen ought to tell them watch out for him too</i><br><br>And another was: <i>You idiot.</i> <br><br>No. Williams clapped a hand to his face and rubbed his round cheeks. He was not the idiot. Bartholomew Staudt was the idiot. Bartholomew Staudt was the man so steeped in his own little publicity games as to accept a prosecutor like this. Williams could only imagine how the old bastard’s heart must have skipped a beat when he found out who Fascere was offering. What a fine opportunity to pretend he was playing hardball with Antonio Sharpe. What a perfect way to guilt all Staudt’s detractors into changing their tune!<br><br>“Too bad you forgot,” Williams spoke softly, “that not everyone’s head is as empty as yours. Ain’t that a shame, Bart?”<br><br>He wondered if he really could just run Staudt straight out of office over this. Putting the mind-reader in contact with those in authority like Williams was not just an act of towering arrogance, but one that potentially endangered the entire city.<br><br>Yet still the fresh thought repeated: <br><br><i>You idiot. Yes,</i> you, <i>you fucking moron.</i><br><br>He had been so obvious.<br><br>Tipped his whole hand. Mind reading or no.<br><br>He shouldn’t have lost his temper. He shouldn’t have forced the man out of this room, or given orders to his officers with the man still present. Above all else he should not have let his fear show. He should have humored the mind-reader for as long as necessary, looping the Brothers Johnson in his head all the while, and then ushered him out politely. Let him go on thinking Williams was too stupid to notice the risks.<br><br>Because now, damn it, Nopcsa <i>knew</i>. He knew how much paranoia he’d inspired in the Commissioner. Might as well have just held up a sign saying <font size="1">GO AHEAD AND READ MY MIND, IT IS MY GREATEST FEAR THAT YOU WILL DO SO</font>. And then it occurred to Williams for the first time: god, could he even show up in court tomorrow? Did he dare? Because he could see now that Nopcsa would spend every moment of downtime idly chipping away at Williams’ brain, if not for the profit then out of sheer spite. Would the Commissioner himself be jeopardizing his own city by coming face-to-face with Nopcsa once more? But how long could he possibly have spent here, listening to the mind-reader’s prattle and dredging up, against his will, more confidential knowledge every second?<br><br>He leaned back into the wheezing leather chair, closed his eyes, and muttered in mild singsong: “Bart, Bart, you stupid old fart, why would you do this to me…”<br><br>Then the phone rang.<br><br>He didn’t need to check which light was blinking red to know that it was coming from downstairs. He picked it up, drew it to his ear, and, after a deep breath, said, “Williams here.”<br><br>“Hello, Commissioner,” came Mrs. Eschholz’s familiar wilting voice. “The prosecutor just spoke to me. He said he eagerly awaits seeing you in court tomorrow, and – well, Commissioner…”<br><br>“What?”<br><br>“He asked you to say hello to the girls for him.”<br><br>Williams slammed the phone down onto the receiver. At once he thought better of this and called Mrs. Eschholz back to apologize. He ascertained from her that Mr. Nopcsa had left the building, and thanked her. Then he slammed the phone back down onto the receiver. He next smacked one of the sagging stacks of documents, the one topped by Nopcsa’s file, off his desk, scattering the papers across the carpet. He seized the arms of the leather rolling chair with the impulse to hoist it through the window, but held back, partially out of doubt that he would do more than put a crack in the triple-reinforced glass, and partially because Officer Gould had reappeared at the door.<br><br>“Everything okay? I heard shouts…” She trailed off at the sight of the papers on the floor.<br><br>Williams blinked at her: Had he been shouting?<br><br>After a moment he shook his head. “I’m fine, Rachel,” he muttered. “No, don’t worry about it, I’ll pick ’em up,” he added, for she had made to retrieve a couple of the files on the floor. He crossed around from behind his desk, but found himself lingering, struggling to remember what he had just said. His breathing was returning, by fits and starts, to normal.<br><br>Gould took a step back from the door, but did not yet remove herself from the situation. “That guy, huh?” she said quietly.<br><br>Williams met her eyes. <br><br>“Yes. That guy.”<br><br>If she had any parting comment, Williams’ mind was already elsewhere. She at least had the kindness to shut the door again behind her, leaving the Commissioner to stand, slightly slumped, amid the puddles of paper, counting the breaths until he could trust that he would sound relaxed enough to call home and talk to his wife. At twenty-four, he reached down, cleared out a space, sat on the floor with his back against the desk, felt around for his cell phone, realized that it was hanging in a pocket of his jacket on the door, and decided that could wait.<br></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">~*~*~ 3:45pm, Johnson and Johnson Jewellers, City Centre ~*~*~<br><br>The trip back to the city centre had been an uneventful one. Since he didn't want to draw attention to himself, or rather imply that he had been around the kid's house by parking his own car in the driveway, he had grabbed a taxi both there and back. The taxi there had been fine, no conversation and a fair tip. The taxi back had been entertaining. The driver had recognised Marshall after a moment or two of thinking, then started sweating. Even years out of the business, Marshall still had that effect on people. If he hadn't cared so much about what his reputation did to criminals, he might have been annoyed. Instead, he just had a private chuckle to himself and stared out the window until they reached the main shopping street. The driver had even knocked a few dollars off the cost of the taxi. Marshall would have forced his money on the driver, but a buck was a buck.<br><br>After having to wait for ten minutes for an expert in the jewellers, he found himself sat in an office in the back of the shop. The so-called expert had already spent most of the time staring at the bracelet in confusion, then interest, back to confusion... Once or twice, he looked like he might have had an epiphany. A quick check of the computer at the desk clearly told Marshall that the expert was wrong. He started tapping his finger against the heel of his boot impatiently, glancing around the room.  At least three of the certificates on the wall behind the desk were forged. No wonder the guy was such an idiot. After another agonising ten minutes, the 'expert' had finally come across an answer.<br><br>"Sorry about the delay, sir," he started. Marshall cut across.<br><br>"Every minute yeh just wasted coulda been put toward helpin' find a murderer, pardner," he said bluntly, putting as much harshness in his voice as possible. "Now, if yeh don' have anythin' useful to show me, I'll report yeh fake certificates behind yeh wall. Spit it out."<br><br>The man had visibly paled. His fingers were shaking slightly as he handed the bracelet back to Marshall, who swiftly stowed it underneath his poncho.<br><br>"S-sorry, sir," the man started again. "It was a little difficult to determine the origin of the bracelet, you see... It, ah, it was brought to us around a decade ago. Completely unique. The man who made the bracelet was a self-proclaimed artist who-"<br><br>Marshall snorted. He'd met one too many self-proclaimed artists. One of them was finally behind bars, hopefully for good. Then again, Miss Attorney seemed like she knew what she was up to. He'd have to keep a keener eye on the case form now on. He waved for the man to continue.<br><br>"Y-yes, a self-proclaimed artist who only made one-of-a-kind pieces of jewellery. Given the materials, white gold, sapphires, some of which aren't even sapphires but coloured diamonds... We never learned how exactly he coloured the diamonds, and he passed away several years ago so we never had a chance to-"<br><br>Marshall tutted loudly, drumming his fingers against his boot again. The man wiped his brow before speaking again.<br><br>"Yes a-anyway, we had that item for several years before it was finally purchased. The bracelet was priceless, though we attached a significantly lesser value to it. It was still near the millions mark. No one seemed to want to spend that much, understandably, but we have a job to value things fairly," he explained, an almost pleading look in his eyes. Looked like he wanted Marshall to validate whether he thought was fair or not. All he did was adjust his hat and continue staring. The man let out a little sigh, but continued anyway. "It was around three years ago, we finally sold it. As is our policy, we receive the address of the purchaser and check it is valid before we finalise the purchase. More than once, we've had a drug dealer or a bank robber come in to buy something, why some of them bought anyway I was unsure, but they had no valid address so we refused the sale."<br><br>"I'll need that information, pardner," Marshall put bluntly. Even without a detective badge any more, he had learned that a strong enough glare with just enough threat in it could get him what he needed. The man swallowed loudly, the tapped a few keys on the keyboard. A sheet of paper ran through the printer. Marshall took the paper and promptly left, his poncho catching the sudden movement and flaring around him as he did so.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Quite certain that he would not work his way to the bottom of this cup, Renard debated whether to leave it on the table or deposit it at the counter, and unconsciously resolved the matter in a moment of distraction by handing it to one of the elder ladies standing in line. With a sweep of air, the scents of Demitasse were left behind for the fresh outdoors, and Micmac rushed not to his side but to the bicycle, eager to move once again. His great broom-like tail swept <i>mecaniquement</i> side-to-side and threatened to topple the bicycle into the gutter, but Renard got a firm hand on Micmac's leash as he hoisted himself up onto the seat.<br><br>At once, however, the beast's onward force strained at Renard's fingers, and within a moment he'd resigned to knotting the leash around a handlebar in order to devote both hands to maintaining his grip. He pedalled uneasily down Chastetree Lane, jerked forward at unpredictable intervals by the excited Micmac. The dog at least had enough sense to trot on the curb, well removed from the automobiles that occasionally wove around the cyclist before surging ahead. As Renard jangled past markets and offices, it occurred to him to hope he might not have said too much to the newspapermen. He <i>had</i> rather let his tongue outpace him. If anything appeared in the <i>Post</i> which M. Williams wouldn't have wished the public to know, the guilt would fall upon Renard's shoulders. But surely he'd offered nothing more than an outsider's opinion—? No, he couldn't honestly say so. It had been <i>une faute</i> to inform M. Millsap that Renard was on an informal assignment from the Commissioner. <br><br>Renard shook his head, tugging at the leash to egg on a lagging Micmac (the reason for whose uncharacteristic delay was a particularly interesting scent on the pavement). He should have exacted the editor's promise that such a detail would not appear in print... Had it been worth that risk to keep their discussion brief? It would not be, if Renard failed to find Jacob Marshall before the day ended.<br><br>A bridge loomed overhead, aroar with motors, and after passing through the cool shade beneath he was forced to squint at the sudden appearance of the inclining sun beyond the shorter row of buildings on the other side. Then a force hurled him forward so violently that in the split-second he had before tumbling off the bicycle and onto the ground Renard was certain he must have been struck from behind by an automobile.<br><br>First a stab of pain in both palms, scraping against the cement, though fortunately preserving his head from the impact. Then a bark like cannonry, followed by another, and a seizing of breath when he understood why the second bark sounded much farther off than the first.<br><br>When the stars cleared from Renard's vision, it was to see that the leash had slipped neatly from its handlebar and that the dog trailing this leash had rocketed down the sidewalk with one deafening bark after another.<br><br>"Micmac!" Renard managed in a gasping shout, for his lungs had taken a forcible winding in the fall. The dog gave no evidence of hearing him. From an automobile up ahead there came a honk which Renard took to be in sympathy, but neither did that halt Micmac in his tracks. It did, however, startle the creature Renard now saw the dog to be chasing: a small furry animal, either a squirrel or a cat. He glimpsed it for only an instant before the prey swerved into an alley, closely pursued. Renard staggered to his feet, ignoring the <i>palpitant</i> pain in his hands, called "Micmac!" again, and took several steps down the sidewalk before remembering the fallen bicycle. When he picked it up it became significantly more difficult to ignore the <i>palpitant</i> pain in his hands. Heaving for air, Renard knew there was no question of riding the bicycle in this state, so he instead hurried down the sidewalk, approximating the act of running as closely as he could, with the bicycle spinning along beside him.<br><br>His silent entreaty went unanswered, for there was no dead end in the narrow alleyway, which opened out onto the next street over. Renard stood there for a desperate moment to catch his bearings before he started down the alley and almost immediately ran the bicycle into a pile of trash bags. By the time he had emerged on the other side to Westring Street, the dog and his prey had disappeared.<br><br>"Micmac!" Renard cried, but this would be the last time he could manage it, for his heart felt as if it had ground to a halt. The street, lined with apartments rather than businesses, was empty but for two long rows of parked cars on either side; there was no one to ask. Renard struggled along for almost a block before he gave up and <i>deposa</i> himself upon a front step. He listened intently for another bark, then almost cursed aloud a passing van making far more noise than should have been permitted of any contraption outside a factory.<br><br>The van disappeared; no bark followed; Renard sat trapped in thought.<br><br><br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler9220259').toggle();if($('#spoiler9220259').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler9220259"><i>OOC: Now you know why, close to a year ago, I wrote in <a target="_blank" href="http://archipelagoexodus.proboards.com/index.cgi?action=display&amp;board=orpboard&amp;thread=2978&amp;page=3#70180" rel="nofollow">another post</a> that Micmac's razor-sharp discipline under Channery had eroded under Renard.

He had suddenly and all too easily conjured up the image of Mlle. Keigler's reaction to this <i>nouvelle</i>. It would be poor enough for her to construe this as an accident, but already he could hear her accusation that it was his fault the dog had given chase at all, that with Renard lay the blame for allowing that Micmac's rigorous discipline had slackened. If she had bruised his brittle ribcage the first time she had met him, then the next time she would splinter it -- <i>Non</i>... that was an overstatement. Still, even through the safety of the telephone this would be a memorably horrible conversation. How long might Renard postpone ringing her over this matter? Not more than a day, surely, unless...<br><br>A sound momentarily demanded Renard's attention, but this was nothing more than the rumble of a motorcycle on the street whence he'd come.

The dog must have been blocks and streets away by now; unless Micmac himself doubled back, there was no chance that Renard could catch up to him, bicycle or otherwise -- especially after such a fall. What was more (and here Renard straightened up on his stair with sudden resolve), if Renard were to locate M. Marshall and escort him to the police station, the Commissioner would be greatly pleased and might even consider himself in a debt to Renard, one which could be easily fulfilled by alerting the patrols to keep an eye out for a great black Caucasian shepherd. Whereas if Renard turned tail now and dragged himself back to the station in shame, while the possibility lurked that M. Marshall might have slipped from the city undetected, there would be no regaining whatever small measure of trust and respect the Commissioner had bestowed upon him.<br><br>His heartbeat and breath gradually returning to normal, the Frenchman pondered his next move with the utmost gravity.<br><div class="quote" timestamp="1357327616" source="/post/72725/thread" author="@evilbiscuit"><div class="quote_body"><div class="quote_avatar_container"><div class="avatar-wrapper avatar_size_quote avatar-85" title="The Evil Biscuit"><img src="http://i153.photobucket.com/albums/s217/evilbiscuit/kaiseravatar-1.jpg" alt="The Evil Biscuit Avatar"></div></div><div class="quote_header"><a href="/post/72725/thread"><abbr data-timestamp="1357327616000" title="Jan 4, 2013 8:26:56 GMT -5" class="o-timestamp time">Jan 4, 2013 8:26:56 GMT -5</abbr></a>  <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="/user/85" class="user-link user-85 group-11" itemprop="url" title="@evilbiscuit"><span itemprop="name">The Evil Biscuit</span></a></span> said:</div>Micmac can take care of himself. You still have to find Marshall! <i>Allez</i>!<div class="quote_clear"></div></div></div><br>And it was not too many moments before his mind had been made up.<br><br>With a silent apology to Micmac and another to Mlle. Keigler, Renard stood off the cement step, took up the bicycle, and wheeled it alongside him back down Westring to the alley through which he had followed the dog. On the other side he emerged again onto Chastetree, where back uphill stood the bridge under which he had taken his fall. By noting these facts Renard realized that he had more or less <i>epuise</i> his reserve of useful information, and he was now, as the Angles would say, at a loose end.<br><br>In order to properly examine his own emotional state he was required to carefully partition off his misery at the (temporary, he insisted) loss of Micmac, yet even when this had been set aside Renard found that his feelings about the task ahead were hardly any cheerier. It was rather as if Micmac's presence had lent an artificial focus, or a distraction -- no, those two were opposites, weren't they? -- still, one or the other; and it was only now, without the company of the dog, that Renard realized what a steep challenge he had been assigned. How should he know, the Frenchman bemoaned as he passed by one unpromising storefront after another, where to find a man he had never met in his life? He reached the bottom of the hill and the intersection of Chastetree &amp; Gilead with no fresh ideas, and the sky overhead had begun to accumulate some threatening wisps of pink.<br><br>Still, he thought while waiting dutifully for the pole opposite to signal his turn as a pedestrian to cross, Gilead Street was not the worst short-term option imaginable. If he followed it south, he would be moving back toward the center of Winstone, surely a sensible direction of movement in lieu of any more particular notion. And Gilead would draw him close to the neighborhood of Lions-ear Round -- once a high-class district in decades past, until the relentless march of wealth had abandoned it as a singularly <i>ecroule</i> slum. Thus a certain few blocks along Gilead, bustling with the dilapidated businesses which serviced Lions-ear Round's locals, might prove to be an ideal place for the search. Renard was pleased enough by this eminently logical conclusion that he managed to hoist himself back onto the bicycle and clattered merrily down the sidewalk.<br><br>So then obviously he just about ran into a lamppost when, some fifteen minutes later, he saw a man walk out of a shop up ahead wearing a Stetson and a billowing poncho.<br><br>Renard dismounted the bicycle and flung out an arm, the sleeve of his overcoat wrinkling back past the elbow. "Excuse me, <i>monsieur!</i>" he called in between wheezes to the man at the end of the block. "Excuse me, <i>monsieur!</i>"</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">So the bracelet was pricey. So what?<br><br>Marshall kept running that thought over and over in his head. He had information regarding the purchaser, but that wasn't likely to do him any good. Checking out the place would be great, but if whoever had bought the bracelet had even an iota of sense they would have done it through a decoy house. No matter what measures the jewellery store had taken, there was always a way around it. Theoretically, anyone could have bought or somehow claimed another house. Drug dealers, bank robbers, even a police officer or someone who had landed a random windfall from the lottery or deceased relative. And if someone had that kind of money, they'd have the money to cover their tracks.<br><br>No, simply put, he still didn't exactly have many leads. There wasn't any denying that little 'Tonio was up to something though. Or, he had been when he'd been given the bracelet. Whoever had sent it clearly thought that 'Tonio, or the Butterfly more likely, was more trouble than they were worth. They'd thought the same about Marshall himself. Not the first. He didn't care about that particularly. He was the one who got results when all of the other detectives or officers were pussyfooting around. Step up and take action, don't spend forever and a day <i>talking</i> about doing something. Idiots didn't know who they'd lost. Sure, it was masqueraded as him handing in his badge but being fired was being fired. Marshall spat on the concrete. Thinking about it left a sour taste in his mouth.<br><br>Time to find Miss Attorney. He'd left just enough clues in their last conversation to send them in the direction of the Criminal Affairs Bureau. That was the place to start tracking them down. He checked time. It had only been a couple of hours since he'd seen them and visiting hours had come and gone already. Still, they stood out a mile. Swing by the front desk and see if anyone had seen them or knew where they were going. He was about to cross a road, when...<br><br>"Excuse me, <i>monsieur!</i>"<br><br>Instinctively, his hand flew for his non-existent gun at his hip. Cursing under his breath for forgetting that it wasn't there, he turned his head in the direction of the voice. To be fair, whoever was shouting didn't seem like they were about to attack him if they were shouting for his attention.<br><br>"Excuse me, <i>monsieur!</i><br><br>And it was a man running in his direction. Older gentleman apparently, looked like he'd been ripped from some nineteen-twenties french crime novel. Marshall folded his arms, his gaze stern as he watched whoever this person was run towards him. Something clicked in his head as the man approached. French, ridiculous clothes, definitely looking a bit clumsy in his run. This had to be that Roulette guy who got that painting back.<br><br>"Can I help yeh?"</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Ah -- yes! Yes, indeed I..." Renard took stock of his words for a moment, unable to avoid glancing at the holster at M. Marshall's hip. Renard would have liked to say he was relieved to see that the holster was empty; assuredly he could say he was surprised, but the endless folds of the man's poncho (of Andean extraction, one imagined) must have afforded M. Marshall ample leeway to conceal a weapon. Looking back up into the much taller man's face, Renard found a new reason to regret the truancy of Micmac, whose <i>impressionant</i> musculature would have lent credibility to the Frenchman's physical presence. The American standing before him possessed a build superficially reminiscent of a bison.<br><br>"You see, I have been asked by the Commissioner to seek you out. He'd like a polite word, and I am to escort you to the police station if that is... ah... altogether agreeable...?"

Still, if Williams wanted to see him then he might be about to glean some information about... well, <i>anything</i> to do with the case.<br><br>The problem was, he'd been acting on his own and without a warrant so currently the bracelet and letters he'd nabbed from 'Tonio's house weren't admissible in court.

Luckily, the Frenchman apparently thought better and, with an unmistakable waver in his voice, suggested a taxi instead. Though he kept his expression harsh, Marshall felt a small smile trying to force itself on to his face. Apparently his reputation was still preceeding him, even to people he hadn't known even existed years ago.<br><br>"A taxi sounds like the best bet," he said, turning to walk. The best place to grab a taxi would be around one of the public transport hubs, the bus station or maybe the trains. As he walked away, he noted the Frenchman following him. A couple of steps behind, sure, but still following him. If Williams was trying to put a leash on him, sending this scrawny man on a bike was almost definitely the wrong way to do it. Maybe it was an olive branch? Nah. Williams was more likely to extend a fist than a gesture of peace, as far as Marshall knew. Hell, the former-detective would have been surprised if the commissioner hadn't tagged him as soon as he'd been kicked off the force. <br><br><i>"Williams must be livid,"</i> he mused as he hailed a cab. After all, having the 'renegade cowboy-cop loose cannon' (and whatever other bullshit the media had called him) blasting back into town after the murder of a member of the force was probably causing a whole series of shitstorms. For the police, it would probably be safer (in their minds, anyway) to have someone tailing him. He hadn't noticed anyone yet, but maybe Williams had toughened his hiring standards. Politically, anyone who hated Powers or suspected him of anything would be having fun either avoiding him or furthering their own agendas. If the media caught wind of him in town again, they'd probably spin some stupid story like 'Cowboy Cop Accomplice To Murder' without any facts.<br><br>Roulette-or-Ratatouille-or-whatever made a few aborted attempts at conversation, but Marshall just grunted in response. The fact that Williams was trying to find him was interesting in itself. He'd been certain Williams had been eager to see the back of him. More than eager. There was <i>some</i> reason he'd called on the Frenchman to bring him in. Was it something to do with 'Tonio? It hadn't been a secret that 'Tonio had ruined Marshall's career, and the media had warped it into some kind of witch hunt against the kid. Bullshit about Marshall was 'treating everyone like a criminal' and 'falsely accusing innocent people'. Marshall knew who was innocent, even if he didn't openly admit to why and how he knew. Apparently everyone had decided to ignore the number of people he'd let go after their interrogation. Idiots.<br><br>The taxi pulled into the police station and Marshall threw a note at the driver before exiting the vehicle. The automatic doors of the Criminal Affairs Department opened and he didn't even bother talking to the receptionist. If Williams wanted to see him, the staff would know.

Mary and Joseph, he's still wearing that ridiculous getup? Well, I'll let Perry know..." Relaxing, she picked up the phone. "How are you, Renard?"<br><br>"<i>Tout à fait bien</i>, Mme. Eschholz, but I..." Renard craned his neck to look through the door Marshall and the officer had vanished through. "I would like to speak to Perry -- ah, the Commissioner -- as well, if you don't mind. I need only a brief word with him." Then, in sudden recognition of a possible need <i>pour justifier</i> his presence, Renard added: "It was on his request I located M. Marshall."<br><br>"Fine, that's fine. He's fine," she said, waving to another policeman who had emerged from the woodwork to attend Renard. On his way out of the lobby, Mme. Eschholz added another question while dialing the phone:<br><br>"How's Knickknack?"<br><br>This seized Renard from within, and he was perhaps grateful that she must not have been expecting an answer: at a glance behind, he saw she was already holding the telephone to her ear before the automatic door slid shut.<br><br>* * *<br><br>"Here you go, sir," said the waiter, laying out three dishes on the table, then lingering for Williams' opinion. He examined the evening's fare carefully but found no complaint: all three, the soup, the salad, and the sandwich, were just as he had ordered them. Monochrome. Drawings, in fact. Three nests of dense linework straight out of a Dickens serial. Actually the soup, the salad, and the sandwich weren't sitting on the table at all: they were laid out on a gray Victorian pier atop clustering wooden arches and columns drawn in the same style. But no, as a matter of fact they were sitting on the table. Just perfect. Exactly what he'd hoped for. In the patterns between the three of them the soup, the salad, and the sandwich lay the question he needed. He started to write: M. No, W.<br><br>"Pretty good, right?" said the waiter. He dropped a stack of thin books onto the dock. The top cover depicted a scribble of a young man holding up the letter H. "I was thinking of doing these next."<br><br>Then the restaurant's fire alarm went off. Williams shook awake. Above his head, the phone was ringing. Williams hoisted up, rubbing the back of his head where the edge of the desk had left an imprint. Downstairs again. Was I really--? He picked up. "Williams."<br><br>"Mr. Marshall and Renard are coming up to see you."<br><br>Christ! "Thank you." He hung up and immediately flung himself back down to the floor to gather up the documents scattered around the desk. He glanced at the clock: nearly an hour had passed since Mr. Nopcsa's exit. I was out that long? Propped up against the desk and snoring? He slammed a stack of papers onto the desk with no regard to their ordering; grabbed another handful. Heavy footsteps outside and a metallic jingle. Williams stuffed the last few papers from under the desk into his hands, momentarily catching another unwanted glimpse of Mr. Nopcsa's leering photograph, before he clambered back into the leather rolling chair. Then there was a knock and Dunn's voice: "Marshall and Rouletabille to see you."<br><br>"It's open," Williams declared, pressing a button at his desk. The handle gave a rigid turn and in walked the "cowboy cop" himself, looking every inch as preposterous as he had three years ago. Following was Renard, also a sight in his nineteenth-century-looking coat (<i>1800s: Victorian: what was that?</i>), but completely inconspicuous next to the lanky, poncho-clad figure of Jacob Marshall.<br><br>"Howdy, Perry," he said, with all the gravitas of a gas station attendant and none of the inherent charm.<br><br>Williams stared at the man for a moment. Then: "Howdy. Rouletabille, thank you. Marshall and I need to discuss some things now."<br><br>"Oh, ah, I'll be out of your hat in a moment, Commissioner," jabbered Rouletabille, not noticing William's nonplussed look of response, "but I do have one small question first. I... ah..." But he trailed off, with an uncomfortable look at Marshall, who was watching him like a snake.<br><br>"Well? Go on," said Williams. "Or is this private?"<br><br>"<i>Non, non,</i> not at all. It's simply that..." Renard drew a hand out of his coat pocket to rub at his hooked nose. "I seem to have lost a handle on the whereabouts of my dog, Micmac."<br><br>Williams straightened up in his seat: Renard had stumbled upon a quick way to get his attention. "When did this happen? Can you give me a minute?" he added, to Marshall.<br><br>The third man nodded slowly, not looking away from Rouletabille. "Sure 'nough," he said. "Real tragedy, there," he told the Frenchman, and received a grateful look in response, though the sentiment hardly seemed genuine to Williams.<br><br>"This happened as I was touring in search of M. Marshall," explained Renard. "A small animal excited him and he -- Micmac, I mean to say! -- he slipped from my clutches. It was on Chastetree Lane. By the time I'd followed him onto the next street, I could see no more of him..." His posture sagged. "I realize you have higher priorities, Commissioner, yet felt I would be remiss in not mentioning the matter to you."<br><br>Williams had already pulled over to his computer and brought up an image search. "He's, what, a Cantonese--?"<br><br>"A Caucasian shepherd, yes," said Renard.<br><br>"Black all over, you'd say?"<br><br>"Down to the paws and the tail, where the fur turns brown."<br><br>"That's right," said Williams, making a note on the back of one of the sheets on his desk, after making a weak effort to straighten out the stack a little. "Any identifying tags? Not that I expect to see anything else half his size out there."<br><br>"Yes, m'sieur, a medal identifying him on the collar. Ah, and his leash will still be attached, I imagine." As Williams took this down, Rouletabille added: "As I say, I know you have questions much more <i>impérieuses</i> at the moment, but should any of your men happen to see..."<br><br>"I'll forward your description, and if any of my officers do see him," said Williams, choosing the word deliberately, "then they'll take him to stay at the vet and you'll hear about it right away." He put the pen down and leaned back. "Renard, I'm sorry to hear this, but if I were you I wouldn't worry. That dog's hard to miss. He'll turn up. We'll make sure of that. Just as long as no one mistakes him for a grizzly and shoots him."<br><br>Too late, he realized he shouldn't have deadpanned that. The forlorn Renard didn't seem to have taken it as a joke. Quickly Williams went on: "Thank you for putting this investigation first, Renard. You'll have your dog back before the trial's over."<br><br>"Yes... <i>oui</i>, yes, thank you..." said Renard vaguely, without looking at the commissioner. "Well, I shall be off then -- oh--" He stooped to pick up a piece of paper that Williams had missed; it'd been curled against the chair which faced the desk. "You may have dropped this..."<br><br>"That's right, thank you," a hot-faced Williams muttered, conscious of Marshall's appraising stare. He accepted the sheet from Rouletabille, who then made an exit with a distracted half-bow. Marshall watched him go, then turned to Williams, clicking his tongue once and shaking his head in indecipherable judgment.<br><br>After a beat of silence, Williams took a breath and, feeling it had to be said, allowed: "Well. Excuse that."<br><br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler7248742').toggle();if($('#spoiler7248742').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler7248742"><i>OOC: The book in Williams' dream was</i> <a href="http://i322.photobucket.com/albums/nn433/asgardreid/alphart.png" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tintin and Alph-Art</a>. <i>Probably stretching his character a bit thin to suggest that he was familiar with Tintin books as a kid, but that entire sequence was copied directly from my dream of a couple nights ago so I figured might as well go all the way with it.<br><br>Apologies for autoing Marshall a bit, though the "Howdy, Perry" was culled from the first draft of Elliot's post.</i></div></div></div>

Renard Rouletabille. Williams had actually tasked a man who couldn't even keep an eye on his dog to find Marshall? Was he desperate or something? He listened to the description of the dog, just in case he happened to see it around town and happened to have his phone on him. Rouletabille might have been an idiot but a dog running around town was not a good thing. Probably. It might attack some kids or something.<br><br>"Well. Excuse that."<br><br>"No problem, Perry," Marshall replied with an easy smile on his face. He'd also been watching Williams throughout the conversation. Not a single hint of a lie, even if he hadn't promised to go out and hunt down the dog himself. He glanced down at the desk, noting the slightly haphazard way the papers had been stacked. A couple of sheets weren't quite aligned properly with the rest of them and the top page was upside down. Put away in a hurry, probably. Was that because they had something to do with the case or..?<br><br>"Busy day?" Marshall asked casually, scratching his chin. He might as well lead in to what had undoubtedly brought him here. "Heard about the all-Power case. Miss Attorney looks like she's got a good head on her shoulders, don't she?"<br></div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Beelzebibble</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Marshall left no time for a reply to his first comment, sparing Williams the obligation to puff derisively at it. <i>Heard about it, did you?</i> Just happened to catch the news, I'm sure. Right. Pure coincidence you showing up now of all times. But the man's second comment demanded a response.<br><br>"Miss Attorney looks like she's got a good head on her shoulders, don't she?"<br><br>Then it seemed he wasn't going to push any pretense about why he was here. That might qualify as a relief, if Williams were familiar with the sensation.<br><br>He interlaced his fingers and leaned forward at the desk. "It does look that way," he allowed, "but Marshall, I'm curious what makes you think so. Let's say I'm curious where and how you and Miss <i>Silna</i> crossed paths. You've only met her recently?" </div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Yoshimitsu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Ah, you know me, Perry," Marshall said flippantly, punctuating his words with a gesture. "I keep an open ear, listenin' in on things. Bumped into her after I went to see li'l 'Tonio in your fancy cells. Staudt's really layin' on the appearences, by the way, ain't he? Greenhorn defense attorney who don't know her way around a case and a mind-reader for a prosecutor? And Hooper of all people?"<br><br>Marshall scratched his beard and looked closely at the Commissioner. Williams had never liked him. He held the same opinion that a lot of the public did: Marshall was a loose cannon and the force was better off without him. If he was being entirely honest, he didn't much care for Williams either. Anti-Power sentiment was all good and well when it was putting the dangerous scum behind bars but Williams had flung himself too far down the knight templar route for Marshall's tastes. After all, half of the criminals held in Winstone were there because Marshall himself had shoved them behind bars.<br><br>"Miss Attorney's nice enough. Had a chat with her in the Demitasse. She really trusts 'Tonio, don't she? But she's honest and loyal, ain't she? She's a force of nature, that girl. Let her into that courtroom and she'll whip up a hurricane that'll put the desert winds to shame. Wouldn't you say so, Perry?"<br><br>He wiped some imaginary lint from his hat and resumed drumming his fingers against the heel of his boot, looking at Williams expectantly. Williams had a reason for dragging him in here. He didn't mind dancing around until the Commissioner finally spat out what he wanted to say.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Beelzebibble</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"I'm glad you think so highly of her," said Williams, gathering up several of the disordered papers on his desk and rearranging them. The copy of Miss Silna's clearance form, marked with Staudt's thin signature, came briefly into his view. "I'm sure you two will make great friends. Maybe if we wrap this up by next weekend, you can go to the zoo."<br><br>He set the papers down in a crisp stack. "But I don't want to hear you've spoken one more word to her until this trial is over. Save the ice cream brunch 'til then. In the meantime, I expect you to steer clear. Do you understand?<br><br>"And that goes for the mindreader, too," he added on second thought, for the sake of completion, although personally Williams would have to admit that in any other context he'd be mildly interested to hear Marshall and Nopcsa butt heads.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Yoshimitsu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"So, Perry, if she gets lost and just happens to bump into me and ask for directions, I'm not even allowed to say, 'Sorry Miss Attorney but our Lord and Master Williams told me I'm not allowed to talk to you'?" Marshall replied with a smirk. "And let's say this mind-reader, this Nopcsa, asks me where the best cup of joe in town is, I'm not allowed to tell him?"<br><br>Marshall removed his hat and examined the brim, keeping the Commissioner in his peripheral vision. He knew it'd be something like this. <i>Oh no, the cowboy cop has returned to Winstone to fuck shit up, get him out as soon as possible</i>. Like hell. The only reason he'd brought himself back was because he'd heard the whispers of the Butterfly again. If the Butterfly had turned up again and let himself be caught so easily, there was almost definitely something going on. 'Tonio in that fancy anti-Power cell... He wasn't there because the police caught him. Something else was happening and Marshall intended to get to the bottom of it.<br><br>"I'm not gettin' involved in this case if I can avoid it," Marshall said, thinking fleetingly of the bracelet and letter hidden under his poncho. He beat the mental images back for the time being. "I don't have the authority to any more now, do I, Perry? Someone, an' I ain't namin' names here, but someone went and stripped me of my badge back in the day, didn't they? But I'm keepin' an eye out all the same. If Miss Attorney needs help, I'll help her out. Even members of the general public are allowed to submit evidence after all, Perry."<br><br>He replaced his hat, turning his full attention back to the Commissioner. He hadn't had too many run-ins with Williams back when he was on the force but something was telling him the Commissioner wasn't about to respond well to Marshall directly challenging his authority like this.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Beelzebibble</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Oh, you're keeping an eye out?" Williams retorted. "Good. Then maybe you've noticed what a clusterfuck this case is. There is already <i>more</i> than enough shit up in the air without you around. Or what, how do you think the public's going to react if they find out you're butting in on the investigation? 'Thank God, the cowboy's back, <i>now</i> we can rest easy!'<br><br>"The fact is, you're not a 'member of the general public'. You're not a disinterested third party. What you are is one more fistful of dynamite to blow this whole thing sky-high, and we're all sitting on enough gunpowder as it is. Maybe you don't care what the backlash would be if they heard you dealt yourself in on this one, but I care. I say you soiled this department's name more than enough while Reese was in charge. You're done."<br><br>Williams halted abruptly, then sighed. The mindreader had already worked him up enough for one day. Marshall might be a Power, too, but he was no mindreader, though close to it. Perry Williams of all people had nothing to fear from him. "Look..." he went on. "I don't want to make you an enemy. I don't need any more of those. My dance card's full; I'd guess yours is, too. But I can't trust you, Jacob. And it is not the right day for my heart to grow three sizes. You can't have thought I was going to tell you anything else.<br><br>"No handing out 'advice' to the attorneys -- especially not Miss Silna. No snooping around for evidence. No more visits to Sharpe. I don't care how sneaky you think you can be, <i>it'll get out.</i> And Winstone's not going to welcome you with open arms." The Commissioner leaned back into his chair and shook his head. "If I find out you've defied me on this, I'm going to have to bring you in for obstruction of justice. That's just how this is going to work. I don't have a choice."</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Yoshimitsu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">There wasn't even a flicker, even a hint of a change in colour as Williams spoke. True or not, Williams genuinely believed that news of Marshall's return to Winstone would cause a shitstorm that could destabilise the legal system, discredit the police and destroy any attempt at finding out who murdered Odio. It wasn't even just a threat about being detained, Williams was more than ready to follow through. Marshall studied the Commissioner's face as he spoke.<br><br>"I'd keep an eye on Miss Attorney if I were you," he said as he stood up and brushed some imaginary dirt from his poncho. "She's loyal, to a fault I'd reckon, and she knows something about this case. Little 'Tonio brought her in for a reason. Her heart might be in the right place but I'd wager her judgement might not be."<br><br><i>Especially if 'Tonio's one of her friends,</i> he added mentally, but chose not to share that one with the Commissioner. He paused at the door, holding it open as he turned his head to look at Williams over his shoulder.<br><br>"I ain't your enemy, Perry. Hell I ain't anyone's enemy when it comes to the Winstone police. Never have been. You bring me in for obstruction of justice and I ain't gonna hold it against you," he said calmly. "I ain't clueless, I knew no one liked my methods. I did what I did, I made the unpopular decisions and I bent the law and roughed it up so that someone else wouldn't have to if they were in my place. If that soiled the department's name, well..."<br><br>He hesitated but ultimately just stepped through the door and let it shut behind him with a <i>click</i>.<br><br>~*~*~*~4:30PM, Hotel Room~*~*~*~<br><br>Illiana looked at the cork board in front of her. After just a few hours, she'd almost managed to fill it entirely. Pictures were pinned on it, some witnesses, some evidence, a couple of copies from the Edward Diamond case. A few handwritten notes and labels were scattered across it. Seemingly every item on the board was connected to at least one other by a web of multicoloured string. She picked up the notepad that was lying next to the board and skimmed through the evidence list again, sighing slightly. <br><br><br><br>Autopsy Report - Bullet to the heart, instant death<br>Crime photo - No exits from room, no blood<br>Murder weapon - 45 caliber gun, heavy recoil<br>Charles Dacten - Family friend<br>Dacten's Letter - Warning to Odio<br>Vial of magic - Contents currently unknown, found in Odio's bedroom<br>Receipt - Several objects totalling $3150<br>Letter - Unknown sender, only says 'Coward' in printed font<br>Edward Diamond Report - Details of the Edward Diamond theft<br><br><br><br><br>"Why did you make me keep the receipt again?" Illiana asked and she glanced at the paper in question on the board.<br><br>"You never know," Yoshimitsu said from his spot on the bed. He was lying down and staring at the ceiling, looking carefree. Illiana tutted, but didn't comment. "Anything is evidence, it could come in handy at some point."<br><br>"I was wondering, Antonio was interrogated by Marshall at one point, wasn't he?" Illiana asked. Yoshimitsu sat up at this and gave her a calculating look. Or it was probably supposed to be a calculating look. Mostly it looked like his eyebrows were doing a little dance. Again refraining from commenting, she continued, "I'm wondering if they had it on tape somewhere? It might be worth a look."<br><br>"I doubt it. From what Antonio was saying, it sounded like he implicated that Marshall had some power. Marshall probably found and burned the tape as soon as he remembered there was one, probably just before he got kicked off the force," Yoshimitsu replied. <br><br>Illiana tutted again but was spared from replying when her phone buzzed, moving very slightly across the table. A quick look told her she didn't recognise the number. Not exactly surprising, given that she'd had to give her number just in case someone involved in the case needed to contact her for any reason. Still, she didn't expect someone to ring her this early into the proceedings. She accepted the call but put it on loudspeaker before speaking.<br><br>"Hello, Illiana Silna speaking."<br><br>"Howdy, Miss Attorney," came the Texan drawl.<br><br>"Detective Marshall, to what do I owe the pleasure?" She asked, glancing at Yoshimitsu. He looked just as nonplussed as she felt. How had Marshall even got her number? <br><br>"Had to go through a lot of effort to even be able to go ahead with this call," Marshall said, his voice only slightly tinny through the speaker. "We're talkin' through a million an' one bullshit proxies, or so I'm told. Was promised it'd take a team of skilled techies to triangulate either of our locations."<br><br>"That <i>is</i> a lot of effort, Detective," Illiana replied, stepping to the window. She glanced down on the off chance but there was no poncho-and-stetson wearing figure below. "I know a few people that might say it's too much effort."<br><br>"Desperate times, Miss Attorney," Marshall said bluntly. Illiana was starting to get a bit annoyed that the cowboy wouldn't call her by her real name. "Just had a little chat with Williams. He's got an unofficial gag order on me. I haven't signed anythin' so technically I can talk to you all I damn please but if he catches me, I'm off to spend more quality time with little 'Tonio than I'd be happy with."<br><br>"He's threatened to arrest you?" Yoshimitsu chipped in. "What if Illiana really wanted to know a decent bar in town and you were the nearest person?"<br><br>"Williams wouldn't know a joke if it punched him in the face," Marshall said, but there was the hint of a laugh in his voice. "Fact o' the matter is, he's got a gag order on me an' I ain't that keen on wastin' time. I got a present for you."<br><br>"A present?"<br><br>"Kinda, yeah. I'll meet you later an' you can have it, complete with circumstance an' why it's not really a present. You best brush up on your evidence law, though. It ain't gonna sing an' dance for you in court," Marshall said. "Give me the go ahead an I'll figure out somewhere we can meet."<br><br>Illiana hesitated. There were a lot of unanswered questions in the case so far, not least of which being how the body got into the bar in the first place, but this was... Marshall was being ridiculously cagey with information. He had <i>something</i>, sure, but in any other situation Illiana would automatically presume Marshall was asking her to carry a bomb or illegal drugs or something. She glanced at Yoshimitsu again and he just held up the notepad. He'd written something.<br><br><i>He's only got lie-detecting as a Power. Bet I could take him in a fight.</i><br><br>She had to stop herself from laughing.<br><br>"Okay, detective. Set up a place and we'll see you later," Illiana said before hanging up. <br><br>"Williams slapped a gag order on the good detective. Impressive," Yoshimitsu commented, throwing himself back on the bed. "Not many people like Marshall, but even so... He's pretty on the ball, isn't he?"<br><br>"Looks that way. What was that about evidence law? Is Marshall going to hand me some evidence?" Illiana asked, turning her attention back to the cork board. It still looked like a mess of string and pictures, no matter how she tried to rearrange the links between... well, everything.<br><br>"There's two basic rules of evidence law," Yoshimitsu explained. "There's like a million sub-laws and stuff but it's the two big ones that everyone follows. The first one is that any piece of evidence has to be approved by an official. Forensics departments, commissioners, chief of police, those sorts of people. Typically, evidence can't be submitted unless it's been authorised by them."<br><br>"And the second?"<br><br>"Evidence must have its relevance to the case proven. This kind of breaks the first law in some instances, but usually they're both upheld. It's like, say..." Yoshimitsu paused for a moment, probably to think up an example. "Say a piece of cloth with a handprint was found in the safe at a murder scene. You don't know when the cloth got there, even if it does have a witness' handprint on it. And let's say, for sake of argument, it turned out that the witness had shoved the person wearing the cloth. Before you found out that the witness shoved the person, it was just a piece of cloth with a handprint on it. Finding out that the witness shoved the person made it relevant and bam, it's passed the second law."<br><br>"So, in your example, the cloth hadn't been authorised by anyone?" Illiana asked skeptically.<br><br>"Who knows? I just came up with it on the fly," Yoshimitsu laughed. "I think as long as it satisfies the second law, it's legal evidence. As long as it's not forged, obviously. That'd just bring any case to a halt and get you disbarred. Not exactly a great start to your budding legal career."<br><br>~*~*~4:30PM, Winstone Penitenary~*~*~<br><br>Antonio slid the sheet of paper to the bottom of the stack, casually glancing at the bars of his cell as he did so. Still no one. The cameras were undoubtedly still training their eyes on him but if he leaned <i>just</i> so, he could hide the sheet and anyone watching him wouldn't be able to see. He'd already made a note of any and all surveillance in and around his cell. Not exactly full of blind-spots but not an all-singing-all-dancing three-sixty degree show. He drummed his fingers on the desk, musing over what to do next.<br><br><i>What tangled webs we weave when we practice to deceive,</i> he thought to himself with a small smirk. Illiana and Yoshimitsu's news (least of which being Yoshimitsu himself) was only causing him a small amount of disquiet. Mildred Hooper, if Yoshimitsu was right, may have some unknown power that let her sniff out any supernatural involvement in a legal case but there was hardly anything out of the ordinary happening on his end. He had merely engaged in a game of cards with the good Commissioner, after all. After having had time to review the information relayed to him, he considered himself in no different position than he had been at the start of the day. Illiana would undoubtedly prove him innocent and he would be back to his regular schedule shortly.<br><br>Illiana had sprung to his mind as soon as he saw he could request anyone, <i>anyone</i> to defend him providing they had a power of some variety. It was worded much differently than that, of course, but the bottom line was the same: this is an All-Power-Court and you can request whoever you like as your defense. Despite appearances, he considered Illiana to be one of his, if not his absolute closest friend. As rough a start as they had, their travels in that parallel world had given way to friendship. Antonio's first real friend in years. Maybe his first real friend ever. He didn't dwell. Friends were for people who weren't going straight to the top. Still, there was a lot to be said for his summoner friend. There was something about her, so noble and loyal and <i>good</i>. It drew people to her. It had definitely drawn Antonio to her, even if he hadn't realised it at first. Something about her nature had made him change in that world. Fighting for survival (and ruining his favourite clothes), roughing it up in the wilderness (and ruining his replacement clothes) and knowing he had only those unlikely comrades to back him up. Illiana had stood out, level-headed and strong-willed. He wouldn't say she made him want to be a better person, more that it was an unfortunate side-effect really, but he absolutely refused to over-analyse it.<br><br>Something pulled him out of his thoughts. A movement in the corner of his eye. It was different to the mechanical movement of the cameras as they panned the hallways. Bigger, for one. And louder. People. He waited a moment for them to still before he turned his head, pushing away from the desk. A shorter girl and a large, muscular man. Both wearing lab coats, of all things, despite neither of them looking like scientists or doctors. They were being accompanied by one of the police officers he vaguely recognized walking past.<br><br>"I wondered how long it would take for you to turn up," Antonio commented.</div></div>

No need to introduce the penitentiary; from the light by the phone he could see it was the station. And indeed:<br><br>"This is Williams," was the response.<br><br>"Hello again," said Ferguson, with a smile. Always worth putting a smile in your voice with Williams. Not in the hope of accomplishing anything, mind. Just to take the high road. "Need more footage, do you? I'd say they could have it ready by the time you get here."<br><br>"No, thank you, Ferguson. No need right now."<br><br>"Just an update, then?"<br><br>"I -- well, go on."<br><br>With a few swift clicks and a code typed in about one-tenth the time it would've taken him five years ago, Ferguson brought up the view of cell SC-4-14. To think there was a time when just opening Internet Explorer would have dazed him. Nothing to 'em, really, computers. The boy was slouched in an awful posture at his desk, apparently writing, though his position made it impossible to see the paper. Might have been drawing a comic book. "No unusual behavior, Commissioner, just at his desk."<br><br>"Fine. That's fine. He's not actually who I wanted to ask you about."<br><br>"Oh?" asked Ferguson, returning to the entry screen.<br><br>"Sometime in the morning, before I came in... I hear Jacob Marshall dropped by. That true?"<br><br>Ferguson's fingers recoiled from the mouse. He'd thought they might have this conversation. In fact he'd been surprised Williams hadn't mentioned it in person. To be perfectly honest, Ferguson had hoped that meant the Commissioner knew and didn't mind, but if he hadn't found out until just now... "That's true, sir."<br><br>"And I understand he sort of swung through Special Confinement while he was there. Pay a visit to Sharpe. This would have been authorized by you, I think."<br><br>Ferguson rolled back in his chair and to the side, though neither of the other officers in the room were listening in. He didn't like that "sort of". Too casual. This was not the turn of phrase of the Williams that Ferguson was used to, not from his four years as Commissioner and nor from his -- what, twelve? fifteen? years in the department before then. He smelled a trap.<br><br>"It's just as you say," he allowed.<br><br>"Okay, I thought so. Now--" (and Williams' voice was still so damnedly level) "--can you remind me, is Jacob Marshall on the clearance list for SC-4?"<br><br>Ferguson swallowed, then said dully, "He's not," into the receiver.<br><br>"Oh. Well then," said the Commissioner, "maybe we should add him. What do you think?"<br><br>At this, Ferguson blinked. "Well, if..."<br><br>"I ask for your opinion of course because in this situation your opinion is the most important one. In fact, I might as well not even bother giving orders at all."<br><br>There. Ferguson propped one elbow on the desk and held his head. <br><br>"It wasn't about disobeying your orders, Perry."<br><br>"No? Do you think maybe I don't care what it was <i>about</i>? I'm not digging for the <i>thesis</i>, here. You broke protocol and compromised the city's security, you can frame that however you want. I should be writing you up for a hearing right now. You disagree?"<br><br>"And what if I trust Marshall?" Ferguson asked a little too loudly. At this, the other officers took notice, and Ferguson hunched at his computer, slightly hot in the face.<br><br>There was a pause, then: "That's fine for you. It's just that I don't."<br><br>"You hardly knew him. Did you even work with him once in the field? I was there at the airport on Easter, you know. I saw him drop his shield and throw Guttuso to the floor the second he took aim at a child." Ferguson slid his chair back and straightened up. "You want to go ask that kid if she trusts Jacob Marshall? I'd guess she's in high school by now."<br><br>"She'd be in a four-foot coffin if Richard Guttuso had sharper reflexes. Look, I know what that meant to you, and I know that I did miss out on seeing Marshall flail for heroics in <i>all three dimensions</i>. But unless you're ready to play apologist for his putting someone's life on the line just about every time he left the station, and lying to the squad the <i>entire</i> time he worked with us, then I don't think we're about to have a productive debate."<br><br>"You're certainly not going to persuade me that he's a wicked man, Perry."<br><br>"I certainly don't have to, Liam. What I have to do is keep Winstone safe, and that includes the prisoners on your watch. Jacob Marshall is barred from entry to the SC block. I have now said that expressly for some reason even though it goes without saying because <i>he is not on the clearance list.</i>"<br><br>"Well, what did he even do?" Ferguson demanded, before he could stop himself; it wasn't even a battle and he still couldn't keep from putting up a fight, old fool that he was. "Just <i>talked</i> to Sharpe, didn't he? D'you think I let him in without searching him first?"<br><br>And the Commissioner said, "Talking is more than enough trouble from him. Ferguson, I'll give you a pass on this one, but you're asking to take a few months at home if anything like this happens again. Marshall goes and rescues a cat in a tree, I'll buy you and him both a drink. But the next time he comes calling, you know your orders."<br><br>That was the last from him. Ferguson set down the cream-colored receiver and slowly sat back. No one else in the lobby was looking at him. After a moment, his wrinkled hand went for the pack in the upper drawer. Seemed it was well past time for a smoking break. But no sooner had he stood to leave than a young pair in white coats swept in past the metal detectors. Ferguson was surprised the man didn't bash his head on the doorframe on the way in. He wasn't so much tall as <i>big</i>: a man scaled up ten percent in every angle. The woman was normal, if a bit above what Ferguson was used to seeing in that outfit. Nice ginger hair. Possibly in pharmaceuticals. His grandson had told him that's where the pretty girls were going these days.<br><br>"Good afternoon," she said, and surprised him, with an accent that suggested... Kent? Surrey? He didn't have an ear for it any more. "Or -- evening? Would you call it early evening by now? We're running about half a day off."<br><br>After glancing out at the grey-pink sky, Ferguson replied, "It's no hangup to me, miss. How can I help you?"<br><br>"Well, we'd like to talk to Antonio Sharpe, actually," she said, pulling mildly at the strap of her purse.<br><br>"Heard our names should be on a list," announced the young man. He was still hanging back by the door as if concerned the other officers in the room would jump him for making any sudden movements. Probably a shrewd guess, at that.<br><br>The woman added: "That's Dr. Tartar, and I'm Dr. Tisher." She handed her ID across the counter. Yes, Kent, actually. The man stepped forward as well, though still looking uncomfortable, and offered his own card. As he took it, Ferguson thought to seriously consider whether the large man had heard the wrong things about the Winstone police department. With both their cards at hand, Ferguson consulted the clearance records on the computer.<br><font face="Arial"><font size="4"><br><hr><b>Tartar, Neville</b> - <i>SC-4 - Sharpe, Antonio</i><br><b>Advisory:</b> Previously administered psychological treatment to SHARPE in Britain. <br>Will visit along with his colleague TISHER.<br><b>Registered by:</b> Denham Landsvale, xx/xx/xxxx<br><hr><hr><b>Tisher, Helena</b> - <i>SC-4 - Sharpe, Antonio</i><br><b>Advisory:</b> Previously administered psychological treatment to SHARPE in Britain.<br>Will visit along with her colleague TARTAR.<br><b>Registered by:</b> Denham Landsvale, xx/xx/xxxx<br><hr></font></font><br>Ferguson eyed the blond man now looming over the counter. "So, not Sharpe's dentist, huh?"<br><br>The man laughed a little too loudly for Ferguson to believe. "He gets that a lot," the woman said with a smile. Ferguson, who certainly didn't see in himself a comedy mastermind, nodded wryly as he handed back the cards. Though, even forcing a laugh did seem to have put Tartar a bit more at ease.<br><br>In any case, Ferguson thought with a certain fierce eagerness, the Commissioner plainly couldn't take him to task for admitting these two. He'd see them to Sharpe himself. "Everything's in order," he told them firmly, and stood from his chair. "And Sharpe is in his cell now, if you'd like to follow me. Spalding, can you--? Thanks," he said to Officer Spalding, who was already taking a seat at the other computer behind the counter. <br><br>"We'd be glad to see him right away," Dr. Tisher agreed.<br><br>After passing through security (where a paper poking out from Tisher's purse caught Ferguson's eye before the purse rolled along out of sight: a brochure with a bright green logo like a stylized three-branched shrub), the two doctors joined Ferguson at the entrance to the side corridor which wound around rather than through the main confinement complex. "This'll be something of a walk, I'm afraid," he told them as they passed into the tall, windowless hall. "Special confinement's on the other end of the main facility," <i>and we prefer just the one public entrance,</i> he thought, but felt no need to add. "It's faster to go right through the main confinement area, but I don't imagine you'd like the scenery."<br><br>"Suits me fine, the walk," said Dr. Tartar, who was stretching his legs as he walked behind the other two. "Not sure if you'd guess this, but I'm not too keen on airplanes..."<br><br>Ferguson chuckled.<br><br>"How about you? Ever been up our way?" asked Dr. Tisher. "Or are you not a flier either?"<br><br>"Oh, no, I never minded it. Puts me right to sleep. Yeah, I've splashed around your way. I used to have family over in Ireland." Still did, he supposed.<br><br>Dr. Tisher smiled at him. "And you'll go back there?"<br><br>He thought about this, looking down at the slightly misaligned tiles as they walked. "I'd like to," he allowed, "if I can get around to it..."<br><br>She nodded.<br><br>"And how does Antonio fly?"<br><br>He looked up again at her with a frown. Her smile, too, had disappeared, and he could tell there was more meaning in this change of subject to her than he could make out of it. She watched him seriously. Behind them, the other doctor had stopped stretching his legs and was walking as quietly as a man of his size could.<br><br>"I'm... not sure..."<br><br>"No, I don't suppose you would know how he came to the Archipelago," she said thoughtfully. "We'll have to find that out. And I guess we'll see how he is on airplanes, too, won't we?" she asked over her shoulder.<br><br>"Hope so," said Tartar. "Hope it's not too much for his nerves."<br><br>"That's right..."<br><br>"Sorry?" asked Ferguson, now certain he'd fallen a few paces behind in the conversation.<br><br>But the red-haired doctor had another question for him. "How has he been, officer? He's reacted poorly to confinement in the past. Have you noticed any unusual behavior?"<br><br>Ferguson reviewed carefully. "No..." he said in a moment. "I don't think so. He's been very well-behaved. Solitary confinement, of course."<br><br>Dr. Tisher's intent look hadn't moved from him. "No actions you might construe as attempts at...?"<br><br>Ferguson looked back at her.<br><br>"Self-harm," Dr. Tartar finished.<br><br>"No!" Ferguson blurted out immediately. "Absolutely not! He's been perfectly fine. It's not as though..." And then he trailed off. He'd been about to protest that there was nothing Sharpe could hurt himself with in his cell, but you could certainly inflict a certain amount of pain on yourself with a no. 2 pencil if you felt so inclined... Ferguson thought back to the footage of the boy hunched over at the desk, scribbling intensely. Had he been able to clearly see that it was paper Sharpe was writing on? Had he been able to see Sharpe's other hand at all?<br><br>"Not as though what?" asked the other man.<br><br>Ferguson shook his head. "I can promise you both, the boy's been fine."<br><br>Dr. Tisher smiled once more. <br><br>"Thank you, Officer Ferguson."<br><br>They said little else until they reached the end of the corridor, and exited into SC block 4. When they reached Sharpe's cell, the boy proved to be sitting at his desk still, and Ferguson was relieved (stupidly relieved, he thought) to see that the boy had been writing after all. He looked up at them with lukewarm interest. Ferguson had to say, that face didn't look like the face of a disturbed youth. More just sort of snotty. But the officer could admit that he was the only one in this gathering of four with no professional insight into the mind of Antonio Sharpe.<br><br>"I wondered how long it would take for you to turn up," said the boy.<br><br>"I'm sorry we disturbed you, Tony," said Dr. Tisher, gesturing toward the papers on the desk. "What are you writing?"<br></div></div>

It's clean, the furniture is adequate and I'm fairly comfortable. I gave it four stars. It would have been five if I hadn't been wrongly accused."<br><br>It was only a matter of time before these two turned up, he reasoned. They'd been annoyances in his life since he was barely fifteen. Fifteen, with all the money in the world and the brains to always complete his objective. No challenge was too great, as far as he was concerned. The bigger the better, in fact. It was just unfortunate he'd been noticed by the wrong people, in his opinion. To be noticed at all was both impressive and a disaster at once, but these two... Always there, just lurking around the corner. Undoubtedly on orders, but that was no less annoying. <br><br>"I assume you two have some reason for visiting me, or is it just a social call?" Antonio asked, his lip curling ever so slightly.

"We're just here to let you know that you're safe. You won't be here for long. I'm testifying tomorrow on your behalf. It's bad enough that they're holding you now without a proper psychiatric evalutation - pardon me, officer--" (and here she nodded toward Ferguson) "--but to commit someone of your mental condition to a prison sentence would be outright unjust."<br><br>"Not that we believe you're guilty, mind," Neville Tartar chimed in. He was hanging back slightly from the bars of the cell.<br><br>"Of course not. But it would be too easy for someone like Justice Hooper to make you a scapegoat in the public eye. The mental health defense simply isn't robust enough here in the Archipelago, and it pains us deeply to see the court prey upon those most vulnerable who pass through its--"<br><br>"Now, hold on, please," Officer Ferguson couldn't help but interject. "We've got an insanity defense, you know. Though in this case I'd hardly see--"<br><br>"No, indeed, you could hardly see that clause being used here." Dr. Tisher crossed her arms, and her smile had vanished, but she kept an even tone. Ferguson supposed someone in her line of work could keep an even tone if they were declaring that the Martians had landed. "That's because it's a reductive, hyperbolic, and entirely outdated legal provision. Suppose Tony did conspire to murder Lawrence Odio..."<br><br>"Which no one here believes," Dr. Tartar added.<br><br>"...Is the court to find that he was in a period of raving madness at the time? That he'd lost all sense of good and evil? Your insanity defense is all well and good for excusing spouses with hatchets, but it fails to take into account the broader, more nuanced story of sustained emotional and behavioral disturbance that explains so much delinquent behavior, especially in the youngest among us." Dr. Tisher smiled again, but this one seemed much more fixed than her last. Ferguson couldn't shake the impression that he was acting in a dialogue that had been rehearsed to precision. "And that is why Dr. Tartar and I will be seeing to it that even <i>in</i> the event--"<br><br>"The unlikely event."<br><br>"--that Tony is found guilty, he will be committed to the care of our psychiatric institution." Dr. Tisher turned her attention back to the boy in the cell. "We want nothing more than to see you home in Britain again, Tony dear. We'll have you back on the virtuous path. You'll be secure, independent, and gainfully employed in no time at all."<br><br>And here she drew out the brochure Ferguson had noticed in her purse earlier, and gave it to the officer. Beneath the glistening green logo, that stylized three-branched shrub, the laminated brochure bore the words<br><br><hr><font size="5" face="trebuchet ms"><b>PLAINSUIT PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL</b></font><font face="trebuchet ms"><br><br></font><font size="4"><font face="trebuchet ms">DEPRESSION - BIPOLAR - ANXIETY - ADDICTION - DEVELOPMENTAL<br><br><font size="2">At Plainsuit, we are solely dedicated to providing best-practice, research-based care and innovative diagnostic and treatment services for adolescents and adults at every stage of their recovery in order to address a variety of behavioral, emotional, and cognitive concerns.

On the back was a phone number and address for their main facility in Birmingham, England, as well as smaller coordinating offices in several other countries including the Archipelago.<br><br>"I'd be very grateful if you'd keep this at the front desk, officer," said Dr. Tisher. "We hope to be kept informed in the chance, however remote, that any troubling behavior arises during Tony's stay. And Tony, you must feel free to call us at the Archipelago office if they'll allow you the use of a phone. Our lines are open at all hours. We want to make sure you feel safe in this unsettled time. You'll always have a friend in us."<br></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Antonio kept silent as the individuals in front of him spoke. It was a waste of time. He stood there and listened, and it was the same spiel every time. Swoop in with promises of psychiatric help, one-on-one therapy, some vague promise about rehabilitation. Anyone who was actually gainfully employed in the field would already be picking at the holes in what the good doctor was saying, but it had just enough terminology that most other people ate it up. He rolled his eyes when she, what did her badge say, Doctor Tisher, handed over the leaflet after her rant about proper procedure.<br><br>As if she knew anything about proper procedure.<br><br>And if she hadn't already destroyed any attempt at credibility, <i>Tisher</i> had brought along the brute. Too big to fit though doors and in a lab coat that was fitted in <i>just</i> the wrong places, too tight around the shoulders but too wide around the waist. Why had anyone let this pair through the front doors? Was a lab coat all that it took to attain admission? He made a mental note. For all Williams might believe his police force was to be reckoned with, they were clearly lacking somewhat in the intelligence department. He clicked his tongue as Tisher finished her speech, leaving a moment before responding.<br><br>"It's very kind of you to visit me while I am incarcerated, <i>friend,</i>" Antonio said evenly, though there was something insincere in his tone. The police officer probably would not notice, but he had no doubts that the two doctors would. "However, you can inform your... what <i>is</i> the technical term now..."<br><br>He made a point of smirking.<br><br>"<i>Supervisor</i>, that while I am touched by his interest, it is misplaced. I am perfectly fine as I am, and I have no plans to allow him to extend his <i>care</i> to me," he continued, crossing his arms and falling back into a defiant posture. "If our business here is concluded, I'm sure the good officer can show you the way out."</div></div>

So I guess writing is okay sometimes. Still, I don't recommend it.</i></div><br><br>This part, now, at least this didn't seem rehearsed. Certain that Sharpe's reply hadn't been what the red-haired woman was expecting, Ferguson quickly looked to Dr. Tisher's face. He was disappointed to see her pleasant expression hadn't faltered, though now that he saw it, there <i>was</i> a hardness had come into her eyes. The big fella, Dr. Tartar, making eye contact with no one, busied himself scribbling in a pocket notebook that looked comically undersized in his hands.<br><br>"I completely understand, Tony. You know your needs best, of course. I hope you'll keep us in mind, all the same." Dr. Tisher straightened her purse strap over her shoulder. "It's wonderful to see you again."<br><br>With that, she turned and strode back through SC block 4 toward the exit for the corridor. Not taking his eyes off the page, Dr. Tartar raised his pencil in an offhand salute to Sharpe and followed. Ferguson quickly hurried after them into the corridor and resumed pace with Dr. Tisher. She was walking briskly enough that it was Dr. Tartar, despite his longer legs, who lagged behind, and Ferguson's stiff joints were hard-pressed to keep up. He noticed now that the woman's smile had pretty well wiped itself away. "Technical term," he heard her mutter.<br><br>He said out of obligation: "if we can help you any further..."<br><br>"Of course, officer," she replied, gesturing to the brochure in his hand. "As I said, please do hang on to it. We'll be staying on here in Winstone for the extent of the trial. We're certainly not about to leave Tony in the cold."<br><br>Ferguson frowned. "Seems to me the boy made his wishes clear."<br><br>Behind them, Dr. Tartar clapped his notebook shut with timing that could only have been in response. "And how many lads like him you ever met who knew good advice when they heard it?" he demanded. "Of course he said no. You don't rush things with a kid like Tony. Tell him what's best and watch him fall over himself trying everything else. Got to come around on his own, hasn't he."<br><br>Ferguson couldn't say this wasn't just about the measure of Antonio Sharpe, but Dr. Tartar's condescending speech about the insanity defense had put him in a state eager to poke whatever hole he could in their reasoning. "Then all of that about 'you know your needs best' - what was <i>that</i>?" he put as a challenge to her.<br><br>She turned a weary eye to him. "Officer Ferguson, would that I were free to disclose our full diagnosis of Tony's condition, but surely everyone here can recognize the <i>acute</i> narcissism from which so many of his other difficulties arise. To a child like Tony, the world is no more than one grand story in which <i>he</i> features alone as hero, agent, and centerpiece. He wants - in fact, needs - to believe himself the nexus around which wraps everyone else's hopes and desires. From beyond this wall of deluded affirmation, it's quite inconceivable to him that the others he sees might be so much as equals - and so, of course, inconceivable that they might help him to improve himself. A child like Tony will never accept an outstretched hand on the first offer. Better to pick our battles than throw up spears at his first line of defense."<br><br>Ferguson drew a slow breath. It was a hard argument to contend, but he couldn't resist pointing out: "I don't much hear psychiatrists talking in terms of siege warfare."<br><br>Dr. Tartar laughed out loud at that, a deep, choppy burst against the narrow and colorless walls. "Then it's true," he said, "you've not met many lads like him."</div></div>

Between that and the smell of the floor cleaner, Illiana found herself reminded of the nightless eternity inside hospitals. It wasn’t the best way to whet her appetite, but she needed something to keep her strength up.

She stalked in a circle around the refrigerated display, occasionally glancing at a sandwich or salad as if checking their expiration date.<br><br>“I mean, think about it,” Nopcsa gave the lever another two pumps for emphasis, bright blue goo overflowing his cup, “They’ve got me, a member of the Fascere Order, prosecuting a thief!”<br><br>“Hey kids, stealing is bad!

        <div class="content"><div class="message">There wasn't much of a selection, Illiana had to admit, as she looked through the options on the shelves in front of her. Sandwiches in every variety, provided the target consumer enjoyed generic meat with generic salad. Not exactly the healthiest options in the world, abd even though she had just stopped in for an evening snack, she was still a bit hesitant to pick anything out. Yoshimitsu was smoking outside, she glanced over her shoulder and saw him with his phone to his ear, and she was pretty sure he would need something to eat too. He might have been moving slowly because of her, but his metabolism was still a mystery.<br><br>Someone's phone suddenly started blaring obnoxiously loud, shaking her out of her daze through sheer irritation.

It wasn't until someone started singing along that she turned her head. The singing, off-key and badly timed, she noted, was coming from a man in a white suit. He was singing, committing to the song even though the lyrics he was singing weren't matching with the original voice, and he was providing more of a dischord than a complimentary voice. <br><br>The swagger he was exuding was what Illiana honed in on. There was a confidence in every step, every single footfall of the polished shoes he was wearing, despite the over-dramatic gestures he was making as he belted out the notes. She might not have had Yoshimitsu to confirm his identity, but the aura that was coming from this stranger told her everything. It wasn't a natural power. There was something in the aura she could feel, something cold and clinical, like being in the operating theatre, sterile and devoid of anything else. The entire feel was artificial, forced, deliberate. She turned back to the sandwiches on display, running her fingers through her fringe to keep it from her face.<br><br>This man, and she knew now that he <i>had</i> to be the prosecutor to the trial. Nopcsa, her brain supplied, and he was talking now. Sauntering up as though he knew her, but her mind was supplying one thing on a mantra.<br><br><i>Mind Reader Mind Reader Mind Reader Mind Reader Mind Reader Mind Reader Mind Reader</i><br><br>He was messing with the slushie machine and she was processing his words while trying to keep her own head in some sort of order. The fact that she was dealing with a mind-reader was completely new, something she had never encountered before, and she had seen a lot in both this dimension and the other. She had fought with dragons and demons and even her own friends, but someone having free access to her inner thoughts and feelings... She could feel her hands trembling as she reached for a random sandwich.<br><br>"Well," Nopcsa said, and she glanced and saw the grin on his face. It wasn't inviting. It wasn't friendly. "Unless..."<br><br>"Unless what?" She asked, keeping the waver from her voice. If he was being antagonistic somehow, she had to do <i>something</i> to throw him off-balance. Even if she had no idea how to do that. "If you're here to slander my race with claims of murder, then you've said enough. Unless you have something worth saying, I'd leave it until court."<br><br>It was weak, and she knew that, but at least it was <i>something</i>.<br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler2369334').toggle();if($('#spoiler2369334').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler2369334">It ain't great, but it's what I got right now</div></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">”It’s funny that you think you’re an actual player in this, Illiana. But then again, that’s the best way to use your pawns- convince them that they’re the ones with some kind of agency.”<br><br>”You know Antonio better than anybody else. And when’s the last time you’ve seen him willing to put somebody else’s well-being before his own? In Antonio’s mind, the only person that matters is himself. You? You’re just a bargaining chip,” Nopcsa glowered at Illiana, before going back to rummaging through a bin full of granola bars.<br><br>“What?” The sound of Illiana’s voice surprised herself.<br><br>”Do you really think he’s pick you over a professional attorney, unless he thought that he’d come out better? I mean, I can name thirty professional defense attorneys in the Archipelago who’d be willing to take his case. And for a nominal fee, the Fascere Order could have made any one of them a Power so that they could partake in the trial. Antonio has the money for this... And instead, he picks a greenhorn like you!” Nopcsa gestured dramatically, accidentally flinging his granola bar across the room, “Sorry.”<br><br>”Is it starting to sink in yet, or do I have to spell it out for you? This whole charade was designed to lull you into a false sense of security. Why do you think Williams was being so genial with you, a <i>Summoner</i>? For fuck’s sake, last time he spotted Summoners in Winstone, he threw them in the slammer just for being here. And that less than two years ago,” Nopcsa’s eyes narrowed, “You don’t do a one-eighty like that unless you’ve got an ulterior motive.”<br><br><i>Where is he going with this?</i><br><br>”Don’t rush me,” Nopcsa raised a finger, “So, anyways, I’m going to tell you exactly how the trial goes, sure as spit.”<br><br>“We’re going to have this big dramatic trial where it looks like I’m going to win, that Antonio’s going to be put behind bars for life, and all that good stuff. Anyways, in the last minute you manage to make some key point and come from behind, and the jury acquits him of murder,” Nopcsa cheered sarcastically.<br><br>”Yay Illiana! Justice was done! Our system works, and it’s all thanks to you! Now, would you mind stepping into a side room for an interview?” Nopcsa waved his slushie around like it was a reporter’s microphone.<br><br>“So, you go with them- And click-click-” Nopcsa pantomimed slapping handcuffs across her wrists, “You find yourself arrested as the new primary suspect in Odio’s death. And there’s no way to get out, because the All-Powers Gimmick Trial means that they’ve probably got security crawling over every single inch of the courthouse.”<br><br>Illiana reflexively took a step away from the mindreader.<br><br>”Why, you ask? Well, I did some reading up on the victim. Microfiche is a hell of a thing,” Nopcsa lowered his voice, droning as if he was flatly reading from a newspaper, “In the Winstone Post, March 17th, 2006, there was a fundraiser held by the WPD, for the victims of the Salcester Incident.”<br><br>“I’m <i>fairly</i> sure you’re aware of what happened there. Anyways, Odio was quoted by a reporter at the event as saying, and I quote, ‘It’s impossible to really convey how horrific the entire deed was, and I can’t even imagine what kind of monster would do such a thing. If a Summoner died for every man, woman, and child that died that day, I wouldn’t lose any sleep over it.’”<br><br>Nopcsa shot an imaginary basketball into the bin of granola bars.<br><br>”SWOOSH! There’s our probable cause!”<br><br>He pointed directly at Illiana.<br><br>”And why would they do something like that to you, when you’ve clearly done nothing wrong?”<br><br>Casually leaning back against the coffee counter, Nopcsa continued.<br><br>”Remember last time Summoners got taken into custody in Winstone? Miko made a fool of the entire WPD by catching them with their pants down, and busting them out. This time, ol’ Perry won’t make the same mistake. He’ll be calling in every task force, police unit, and military squad he can get his hands on. And they’ll be waiting for the most wanted man on earth to come to your rescue, just like he did for the other two after the Ansonia Incident.”<br><br>”Williams believes very strongly in justice... But of course he’d be willing to trade somebody who murdered one man for somebody whose death toll is in six digits. Antonio gets to walk free for his part in catching the most wanted man on earth, Williams achieves the greatest coup possible for any political figure in the history of mankind, and you probably get set free a few days later no worse for wear.”<br><br>Nopcsa’s grin grew.<br><br>”I mean, your people will be out an Emperor, but I’m sure that’ll all sort itself out.”<br><br>He pushed to his feet, and began walking away. Without glancing towards the cashier, he tossed exact change for his drink onto the counter.<br><br>“If you want to do what’s best for your people, Illiana, you’ll skip town tonight. If you go to that trial, you’ll just be playing right into their hands. You might say Commissioner Williams seemed nice when you talked with him, but-” Nopcsa tapped his cheekbone, “I’m a mindreader. I’ve been in his head, and I can tell you the exact number of times he thought through this plan. Right now, your best move is getting out of dodge.”<br><br>Nopcsa shrugged.<br><br>”But hey, if you want to throw away the future of your entire race, it’s up to you.”<br><br>He opened the door to the gas station, and walked directly into Yoshimitsu.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Yoshimitsu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"That would be all well and good, Mister Nopcsa," Yoshimitsu said as he entered, shoving the mind-reader to one side so that he couldn't make a quick getaway. He glanced around the shelves as though he was actually interested in the selection of candy bars, keeping Nopcsa in the corner of his eye. The mind-reader hadn't moved, but neither did he look particlularly scared. He stopped and turned his head, pinning this suit-wearing prosecutor with a level gaze.<br><br>"If you weren't talking shit."<br><br>He casually ran his fingers through his hair and took a few steps towards the prosecutor, glancing back and seeing Illiana's shocked expression. Whether shocked by Nopcsa's words or his intervention, he couldn't tell.<br><br>"Here's the thing, Mister Nopcsa," he said, his tone even and his voice clear. "What you're saying would have made sense two years ago. I would have believed what you're saying to the letter, because that was the state of affairs. Williams <i>hated</i> Powers back then, and he hasn't exactly been fond of them ever since, but he has shown respect for them. He's given them the berth when they've required it, and been hard on them when they've deserved it. He's a hell of a lot more level with them nowadays, compared to what he was like two years ago."<br><br>Yoshimitsu paused and thrust his hands into his pockets, giving the cockiest smirk that he could.<br><br>"You know Williams from two years ago, and you barely knew him back then," he said, letting his posture relax. "The Williams back then wouldn't have even <i>dreamed</i> of letting a Summoner into the house of a murder victim, let alone a house that still had the victim's family present. You're trying to spin that story, but the evidence stacks against you. You're seriously trying to tell us that Williams is willing to let innocent civilians potentially fall victim to violent antics, when he's let Illiana into their home? All to catch someone who has proven capable of overpowering his entire force?"<br><br>He stood for a moment, and he felt the ruffling in his head. It was the sort of fiddling that made colours switch and a mild lightheadedness, something that was enough to make him think something was wrong but not enough to know exactly what was going on. Yoshimitsu kept his posture relaxed, despite his urge to tense up against the intrusion. Whatever dirt Nopcsa was trying to dig out of him, it wouldn't be enough. Unless the mind-reader managed to sort through exactly what had happened, and that would be a headache in itself, and ignoring the jumble of thoughts that Yoshimitsu had every minute, he'd be fine.<br><br>"So, about Vincent."<br><br>Yoshimitsu's eyes locked with Nopcsa's. Shit.<br><br>"You need to be really careful about what you say, Nopcsa," Yoshimitsu said quietly. Any of his friends would have recognised that tone. The quiet tone, his friends called it. The tone that people didn't argue with.<br><br>"He died kinda pathetically, didn't he?" Nopcsa continued, and Yoshimitsu was willing the mindreader to stop, <i>wishing</i> he would stop before he said the wrong thing. "After all that you did to try to cover for him, and he still came charging in-"<br><br>Nopcsa's voice cut off when Yoshimitsu shoved him up against the wall, forearm pressing hard against his neck, right below his Adam's apple. He was pressing hard enough, <i>just</i> hard enough, to be cutting off some of the air that Nopcsa was breathing. Not enough to bruise, and Nopcsa's expression said all that he needed to know. He wasn't taking this seriously. Fine.<br><br>"You won't do it though, will you?" Nopcsa challenged, and Yoshimitsu felt that same ruffle in his mind. <i>Either get out of my head or submerge yourself.</i> "You don't kill people. That's your one rule, isn't it? You hurt, you maim, you manipulate, but you don't kill. Why should I be scared right now?"<br><br>Yoshimitsu increased the pressure on Nopcsa's neck, certain that he was cutting off air supply now. Allowing just enough to breathe, but not enough to be comfortable, or even secure in their likelihood to live. He watched Nopcsa splutter for breath, spit flying from his lips and his face turning red. Even still, he could see that the mind-reader wasn't scared. He expected Yoshimitsu to drop him. He expected a lot.<br><br>He lowered his arm and let Nopcsa fall to the ground, but leant down next to him, putting his hand on the back of the mind-reader's neck. Nopcsa was getting his breath back quickly, and his confidence wasn't far behind.<br><br>"You should be scared. You haven't gone deeper into my mind," Yoshimitsu said, quietly, calmly and controlled.<br><br>"No, that's why you should be afraid of me right now," Nopcsa said, finally getting air back into his lungs, and definitely recovering that superiority.<br><br>"Try being afraid of me. Go deeper."</div></div>
