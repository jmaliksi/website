        <div class="content"><div class="message"><i>Brisbane, Australia</i><br><br>“Do you like rum, Halley?”<br><br>Three people stood in front of a shelf of various spirits in an unremarkable but busy liquor store. One, a warm, hospitable young man, in his mid-20s, arms covered in sailor tattoos and a perpetual tan, examined a bottle he held in his hand, and brushed some messy strands of brown hair out of his eyes with the other.<br><br>“Like it? Nothin’ beats a cool mai tai by the sea!”<br><br>Another one, a tall, scrawny woman, also in her 20s, had various piercings on her face, her share of tattoos, and an eccentric haircut that most would call a “mullet” but Halley would say, “Come on, you make it sound so uncool!” Her left fingers drummed on a large heavy satchel she used for transporting mail and parcels.<br><br>“Haha, good! Then we’ll have some mai tais tonight before we leave for the Archipelago.”<br><br>“Dad, what’s a mai tai?”<br><br>The last person was a small girl, 10 years old, with long waves of dark colored hair and a bright, inquisitive look in her eyes. She looked at every product in the store with wonder, asking about everything new she saw. Her father chuckled and started walking toward the checkout counter.<br><br>“It’s a fun drink that you won’t get to have until you’re much older, honey.” He ruffled her hair and paid for the bottle and led everyone outside to start heading toward the shore. “Halley, have you been to the archipelago?”<br><br>Halley strokes her chin for a second, trying to recall. “I don’t think I have?”<br><br>“You’ll like it. Lots of great people, lots of beautiful things to see. Had a lot of good friends there, I miss them now and again sometimes.”<br><br>“You have a ship, why don’t ya just go and see them again yourself?!”<br><br>He smiled again, this one a pained smile full of bittersweet emotions. “Ah, well, it’s not quite the right time yet. For every friend I’ve got there I’ve got a few other people who probably would cut off my head if they could.” They got to the harbor and stood in front of a modestly-sized wooden boat with a dragon’s head masthead, the name <i>Shahrazad</i> carved into the side of the bow.<br><br>“Sam, you’re a man full of mysteries.”<br><br>“Haha, then let me clear up one of them for you, Halley. You don’t have to call me Sam anymore, I’m not going to be living in the shadows anymore; when you’re done with your job, I won’t have to anymore.”<br><br>“No, please… Call me Hector.”<br><br><br><font size="1"><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler7908874').toggle();if($('#spoiler7908874').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler7908874"><i>OOC:<br>Anyhoo, consider this the start of the grand comeback, and the start of the passing of the torch of sorts. The best entry to make here would be with a character who's never known Hector. also, he's got a habit of picking up, uh... lovers... every stop he makes, and likes to romance them on the boat for a few weeks before he drops them back off when he's done with his trip. (Some things never change, I guess) So if you wouldn't mind that approach, there's an in you can take. Otherwise PM me??<br><br>ETA: I should add that I'm pretty sure Hector would have a deckhand or two helping out with the ship. It's not a huge ship by any means, but it's definitely a big enough ship for someone and their kid to live in. If you're interested in that job, again, PM me.<br></i></div></font></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">A deckhand peeked out from the boat and extended a board so that the three could walk onto the ship. Shortly after setting foot on the <i>Shahrazad</i>, a shaggy black and white mutt appeared from inside the ship and barreled towards the young girl. "Harlock! Hey, boy!" She took the dog into her arms as he licked her face excitedly.<br><br>"Heh, nice dog ya got here." Halley kneeled down to pet the dog, overwhelmed by all the attention it was getting.<br><br>"Haha, we found him aboard the ship one day. We don't really know where he came from, but we don't mind stowaways too much around here, especially when they're this cute." Hector pulled out a bag of fresh dog treats and dangled one in front of Harlock. "Hey boy, we brought some kangaroo treats back for you from Aussie land. Sit! Speak!" Harlock obeyed every command perfectly and accepted his reward with eagerness. "Good boy, Harlock."<br><br>Hector stood up, arms akimbo. "So, mai tais? I've got a stocked bar in the boat. It ain't much, but--"<br><br>"Ah, hush! I used to be a bartender, I can make it work!" Halley took the bottle of rum and Hector led her down into the boat and into the bar. His daughter stayed on the boat, now engaged in a jaunty game of catch with Harlock.<br><br>"We can make a few drinks, grab some chairs, and chill on the boat and watch the sunset..."<br><br>Back on the deck of the boat, the ball went sailing overboard and landed with a loud splash in the water. "Oh no!" She gasped and quickly scrambled back onto the shore and waded into the water to retrieve it.<br><br>"Nice family you got here." Halley paused on the way to the bar and kitchen area to examine some pictures hung on the walls of the passageway, namely one that formed the centerpiece of the arrangement. It was a photo of Hector, in an elegant antique captain's coat and crouched down on one knee, his daughter, and Harlock. They were locked in a tight embrace on the deck of the ship.<br><br>"Ahh, yeah. I love Pleiades. She's the apple of my eye, I can't believe how big she's gotten. I feel like such a lucky guy to have a wonderful ship and a beautiful family." Hector looked at the arrangement on the wall, misty eyes getting lost in the picture for a moment. "Me, my little sailor, Harlock, Ari the deckhand... having adventures around the world and on the seven seas. It's a good life."</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"You don't mind stowaways too much?" A girl's voice came calling out from inside a crate in the corner of the kitchen, high and questioning. A moment later, she poked her head out from her hiding spot, her brown eyes big and pleading. The girl slowly rose to her feet, revealing that she was only dressed in a conservative red tank top and matching sarong for a swimsuit. Tied loosely at her hip was a silver yo-yo that gleamed in the sunlight that shone in through the portholes. Her figure made it obvious she was only in her early teens, and she barely came up to Hector's chest.<br><br>She offered her hand in greeting, her small hand dwarfed by Hector's huge salty mitt. Despite looking so diminuitive, she shook his hand with enough enthusiasm to make his shoulders shake.<br><br>"I'm Didn't N!Qweba, and I'm pleased to meet you! Please don't feed me to any sharks!"</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Cendra</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Flits of black, white and blue darted here and there around the Brisbane harbor. Some might have thought it was odd to see so many there, but really, butterflies loved the salt and other minerals the area had to offer. <br><br>Lorenna walked up and down the length of the shipyard nervously. She had been keeping an ear open for anyone heading to the Archipelago for a few days now. Unfortunately most of the ships that had left were either full or had some unsavory angle to them she wasn't willing to risk her life with. Black curls tumbled over her shoulders. Some blew across her face as she looked down at the letter in her hands reading it again.<br><br><i>Hey there Little Butterfly,<br><br>I know it's been a while. I didn't think it would take me so long to get things set up, but you know how work can get sometimes. However! I'm happy to say that our home is</i> finally <i>ready to move in to!  You're going to freak out when you see it... in a good way. No more details though! I don't want to spoil any of the surprises for you. <br><br>I called your mom last week. Everyone is doing just fine. They're worried about you of course, but they're getting through things well enough. No one's bothering them. I made sure. <br><br>Anyway, get your butt over here ASAP!  We have sooo many things to catch up on.<br><br>Love you lots!<br>MidKnight <br><br>P.S. I got you covered on the money side. Just find a good ship and</i> be careful<i>. See you soon, Sis!</i><br><br>Lorenna couldn't help, but smile as she read the words again. She was going <i>home</i>. She hadn't been able to say that in a long time. <br><br><i>Archipelago...</i> <br><br>A picture of the islands and a boat with dragon's head as its masthead floated gently into her mind.<br><br><i>Shahrazad...</i><br><br>The shape of the letters were a bit fuzzy and kind of tickled her head, which was a little weird, but butterflies didn't really read after all. <br><br>More pictures and feelings flashed in her mind as she hurried to find right the ship. <br><br><i>A little girl and her dog....<br>A man...<br>A woman...</i> <br><br>“A family maybe?” She thought to herself. A pang of sadness hit her chest, but was quickly put away for a feeling of excitement instead.  That could be perfect if they had a place for one more. <br><br>Skidding to a stop, Lorenna reached the boat just as the little girl was about to go back on deck from retrieving what appeared to be her dog's ball.<br><br>“Hi, there! Are your parents around?” she panted out to the little girl. She didn't know what the proper etiquette was for boats, but she felt it would be weird to go on board without permission even if just to get an adult's attention.  </div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Loogs</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">“Huh?” Pleiades was about to climb back onboard the ship when she heard a shortness of breath and a voice calling her. She turned around and met Lorena’s gaze with the kind of jaunty enthusiasm towards strangers you inherit naturally from your sociable drunken sailor of a father. “Hi! My dad’s up on the boat, do you want to talk to him?” She called out to the boat as loudly as she could. “DAD!!! DAAAAAD, SOMEONE WANTS TO TALK TO YOU!!”<br><br>~*~<br><br>Hector and Halley had just stepped foot in the kitchen when Didn’t made her presence known, startling Halley. “BWAAAH!!” She stared wide-eyed and slack-jawed at Didn’t. “WH-“<br><br>Hector simply chuckled and accepted the handshake. “How did you end up in my crate of old shipwreck junk? It’s not exactly the most comfortable place to take a nap in.” He lifted her out of the clutter of old, rusty, grimy objects and placed her on a proper stool from the bar area. “Don’t worry. I’m not gonna feed you to the sharks. In fact, I’m gonna give you a more comfortable place to rest than where you’ve been.” He wandered over to a little mint-colored fridge, adorned with magnets from all over the world, and placed a hand on the handle. “Are you hungry, sweetheart? Did you get lost? Is there someone who takes care of you?”<br><br>He was about to open the fridge and bring out some leftovers from last night’s dinner to offer to Didn’t before he heard Pleiades’ voice beckoning him back on the deck. Hector hastily opened it and quickly thrust a container of fish stew into Halley’s hands before dashing out of the kitchen. “Microwave’s on the counter over there by the stove, would you heat that—“<br><br>“Uh-“<br><br>“—up for our new houseguest while I go tend to this—“<br><br>“But wh—“<br><br>“—Thanks Halley, you’re a peach, be back in a sec!” Halley could only stare blankly at the container and only caught a glimpse of Hector as he hustled up the stairs and out onto the deck. Helpless and bewildered, she then looked back at Didn’t as if she were some form of alien and eventually tottered her way over to the microwave.<br><br>~*~<br><br>“Whatcha need, sailor?” Hector emerged from the hatch and jogged over to Pleiades.<br><br>“Some lady wants to talk to you.” She pointed to Lorenna and upon successfully summoning the parental unit, climbed back on board the ship and resumed play with Harlock.<br><br>“Oh? More guests? Who might you be?” Hector smiled and waved in a warm, inviting manner. “Do you need some help with something?”</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Cendra</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">“Yes, please.” Lorenna gave a friendly smile and nod to the girl. She hadn't expected her to shout for her father, which caused a little blush of embarrassment to tinge her cheeks at having made such a ruckus. <br><br>The father soon came jogging up to his daughter. He seemed a bit intimidating at first with his arms covered in tattoos, but her fears were dissuaded at the friendly manner he greeted her in. <br><br>“Hi, There! I'm Lauren!” The alias name slipped smoothly off her tongue. She'd been using it for the past years or so. It was basically like a nickname by now. She waved up at the man. He wasn't as old as she was expecting, maybe just around her big sister's age.<br><br>“Some help would be great!” her voice had a note of relief, “I've been looking for a reliable ride to the Archipelago so I can meet up with my family there. Do you happen to know of any good boats heading that way?” She knew, of course, that he was heading that way himself, but in her experience it was always better to make things the other person's idea.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Didn't closed her eyes happily, and shook her head as Hector questioned her, the fine braids of her cornrows swishing back and forth.<br><br>"Nope, nope, nope, nope! I'm not hungry, I'm never lost, don't have anybody to take care of me, aaand there was only three questions, wasn't there?"<br><br>The girl bounced up onto the island in the middle of the kitchen, spinning in mid-movement so that she landed seated on it.<br><br>"So, Halley..." She made a valiant attempt to meet the courier's gaze, "Were you named after the comet?"<br><br>Didn't shrugged.<br><br>"People make <i>such</i> a big deal out of it, but I think I've seen it-" She went silent as she began counting on her fingers.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Loogs</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">“The Archipelago? We’re headed there right now actually, so you can catch a ride with us.” Hector walked down off the boat to greet Lorenna, extending a hand to shake with the young girl. “Nice to meet you Lauren, I’m He—uh, Sam. Sam Charbonneau. We’ll be stopping at Bryn Tawel, so I can drop you off there, and then it’s up to you to find a ride to wherever in the Archipelago you’re looking to go.” He led her back up the ramp onto the boat.<br><br>“This is the <i>Shahrazad</i>, the place we call home. We have some good times here, when I’m not on a treasure diving job.” Hector skipped across the deck, arms outstretched and taking on the job of tour guide with gusto. “Or fighting off dragons.” He twirled around the mast and winked. “Though sometimes those can be good times too.”<br><br>~*~<br><br>“Ahh, yeah… I was.” Halley glanced at the microwave just as it beeped three times to signal that it finished its job. She fetched a spoon from the rack of clean dishes in the sink and opened the microwave. “I was born the year it came back around. It was so bright on the night I was born, my parents thought it was some kind of auspice. Like the stars aligned just right and it was supposed to mean good things for my future.” Halley cracked open the lid of the container, letting the contents vent for a moment. She caught a whiff of the stew and made a low sound of intrigue. “Ooh, that smells nice. So… I guess if you’re not hungry… You wouldn’t mind if I just kinda…. Helped myself to this?” The question was really a formality, however, as Halley had a mouthful of fish by the time she finished asking.<br><br>Pleiades skipped into the kitchen, having changed into a mint-colored loose sundress with salmon-colored ribbon accents for the occasion. “Hey Halley, Dad says he’ll be back in a bit, he’s giving someone a ride to the Archipelago and he’s showing her around the boat right now. Who’s that?” She pointed towards Didn’t and hopped onto a spare stool.<br><br>“Didn’t,” Halley grunted between mouthfuls of food. Oh boy, more kids. Definitely Halley’s forte, for sure.<br><br>“She didn’t what?”<br><br>“No, that’s her name! It’s Didn’t!”<br><br>“Oh! That’s a good name. My name is Ple—um, my name is Miriam,” Pleiades introduced herself and gave a little waving gesture. “Are you one of Dad’s friends or Halley’s friends?”<br></div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Cendra</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">“Really?” Lorenna beamed up at the young man and returned the firm handshake with her own. Granted, it wasn't as firm as his, but her parents had taught her never to give a “fishy” handshake.<br><br>“That would be amazing.” She adjusted the light brown messenger bag she had secured on the opposite shoulder and followed h him up the ramp.  “My sister should be able to pick me up from there I think. I'll just have to let her know before we set out, of course.”<br><br>Lorenna chuckled as Sam twirled around the mast and winked. <br><br>“Treasure diving and dragon fighting! This might be more excitement than I bargained for!” She put her hand over her heart in feign shock. <br><br>“Oh! Speaking of bargaining, how much <i>is</i> passage on this fine dragon slayer's ship?” She rubbed the back of her neck with her hand, a little embarrassed. "This is my first time traveling by boat, so I'm not quite sure how everything works."   </div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"It's okay, I'm not very hungry right now. That friend of yours... He's really hospitable, isn't he?" Didn't lowered her voice, conspiratorially, "Or is he just trying to get rid of leftovers?"<br><br>It was then that the younger girl showed up.<br><br>Didn't paused, thoughtfully, as the newcomer questioned her.<br><br>"I don't know your dad, and I don't know Halley, I think... But I'm your mom's friend! We've had so many adventures together!" She offered proudly.<br><br>The other girl pursed her lips, and slowly began backing away. Didn't saw Halley begin reaching for something, though she couldn't tell if she was going for her cellphone or some sort of weapon.<br><br>"Pleiades Nyktori?" Didn't offered, and both of her new acquaintances only grew tenser. Miriam turned and glanced over her shoulder, as if getting ready to flee, and the courier began tensing. Didn't wasn't sure if she was going to lunge over and tackle her, or just screen for the little girl to make a break for it.<br><br>"Uh, sorry!" Didn't raised her hands, fingers splayed, and took a step away from the others, "I... guess Pleiades isn't your mom? It's just, you look so much like Pleiades, that I guess you've got to be related to her somehow? I... I can let myself out, if you guys want."</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Loogs</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Halley’s eyes widened and her breath became shallower and shallower until she made a sudden lunge at Didn’t, pulling her aside and holding a finger to her lips. “Alright, you listen here,” Halley hissed, coming off as rather draconic between the whisker-like septum curl and the fanglike snakebite rings. “I dunno who you are, or where ya came from, but you know a little too much for my tastes. From now on until I say otherwise, this is Miriam and we’re guests of her father Samuel, capiche?” She wagged a stern finger in her face, then turned to Pleiades. “Keep an eye on our friend here. I hafta have a word with yer father posthaste.”<br><br>~*~<br><br>“How much for passage?” Hector laughed. “We don’t really charge for rides if it happens to be somewhere we’re already headed. We appreciate any spare change you can kick our way, but really, the only real condition is that you just pay it forward, kid.” He slapped a hand on Lorenna’s shoulder affectionately. “I used to live on other people’s charity. I’m just paying off my cosmic debts. When you meet a stranger who needs your help, just make sure to—“<br><br>“Sam, c’mere, I need a minute with you.” Halley peeked her head out from the hatch. “Kinda urgent.”<br><br>“Uh… Lauren, I’ll be back with you in a sec.” Hector followed Halley into his bedroom, closing the door behind him. “What’s going on, Hale?”<br><br>“That kid. Something’s up, I’m not sure how, but this kid knows Pleiades and she might have ties to Vathalé. We gotta make sure she doesn’t blow our co—“<br><br>“Halley, I’ll handle this. She may very well have ties to Pleiades, Vathalé, the summoners—but in the end she’s still a child. I’m a dad. I’ll handle this. You go get our friend Lauren settled in here and whip up a few drinks.”<br><br>They went their separate ways; Hector to the kitchen to speak with Didn’t, Halley to the deck to offer hospitality to Lorenna. He walked over to the two girls and knelt down. “Didn’t, sweetie, I’d like to talk to you for a sec. Don’t worry, you aren’t in trouble, I just want to ask you a few questions so I can get to know you better, okay?”<br><br>Hector led her into one of the spare living quarters and sat her down on the bed. It was a tiny little room, not many furnishings besides the small bed with paisley-patterned royal blue bedsheets and pillows, a trunk covered in stickers from all over the world, and a nightstand with a drawer and a lamp. On the wall facing the bed there was only a porthole and a beautiful watercolor painting of a floating market in Bangkok in an elegantly minimalistic picture frame.<br><br>“This is where you’re gonna be sleeping while you’re here with us. It’s cozy, and the waves are usually gentle enough to rock you to sleep. If you need anything like a glass of water, knock on Ari’s room next door.” Hector pointed in the direction of the room. “Or come find me.”<br><br>“You seem to know my daughter… Where… did you two meet?”<br><br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler1264184').toggle();if($('#spoiler1264184').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler1264184"><i>Do a bit of autoing if you have to, yall</i></div></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">“Sure thing.” her voice trailed off as Sam disappeared down the hatch. Lorenna looked about the boat as she thought. <br><br>Sam seemed to be a nice guy. Very friendly and personable. The woman that called him below, however, seemed a bit frazzled. It could have just been some kind of trouble with the boat, but as Lorenna was learning, better safe than sorry. When the hatch was opened again the woman climbed out and a small white butterfly fluttered down inside before it was shut tight again. <br><br>“Hello,” Lorenna gave a friendly wave. “Everything's okay I hope?” </div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Oh, I don't know your daughter," Didn't shrugged, "It's just that she looks exactly like her mother."<br><br>She threw herself onto the bed, the springs in the mattress squeaking loudly at her rough treatment. Propping herself up on her elbows, the girl met Hector's gaze.<br><br>"Pleiades is your wife, right?"<br><br>A loud groan came from beside Hector. He turned, and saw that he'd accidentally yanked the door to the room off of its hinges.<br><br>"No, no she is not," He maintained his gentle grin, "But everybody has a twin somewhere, they say. Here, it's just Miriam and me. Her mother, well-"<br><br>"Is the door going to be okay?"<br><br><i>Oh thank God.</i><br><br>"Oh, it's fine! Happens all the time!" Hector breathed a sigh of relief, "I'll go get my tools and patch it up."<br><br>As he turned to leave the room, Hector mused over the fact that he'd finally found a situation so dire that damage to his beloved ship was an acceptable alternative.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Loogs</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">“Oh, everything’s fine. Sam just had to take care of a few last-minute tasks before we set sail.” Halley grinned and absent-mindedly cracked her knuckles when she heard a loud noise coming from inside the ship. “He’s got it covered though. Don’t ya worry about a thing, doll. Wanna come inside and get settled in?”<br><br>Halley led Lorenna into the ship and walked her to one of the unoccupied living quarters, opening the door. “Sam says this’ll be your room to sleep in.” This room was another small room with modest furnishing; the bedding was patterned with a sunset-colored gradient, a faded green trunk lay at the foot of the bed, and another nightstand to the right of the bed with a lamp on it. “He says go ahead and leave all yer stuff in that trunk, and then you can meet us up on the deck. I’m gonna go start making drinks. See ya in a bit, kid.”<br><br>As Halley slipped out of the room and made her way to the kitchen, she bumped into a visibly flustered Hector carrying a toolbox. They scurried into his room quickly and Halley asked, in a hushed voice, “So what happened? Is everything alright?”<br><br>“Yeah, we’re fine… for now. That kid’s not a threat to us, but she’s certainly, uh, odd. But we better get going ASAP before our plan gets blasted to bits.”<br><br>“What the heck was that sound I heard just a few minutes ago?”<br><br>“Oh, I pulled a door a little too hard and ripped it off its hinges. I’m about to go fix it right now. No big deal. This old girl’s seen worse.” Hector twirled a screwdriver around in his hand. “No need to fret for now, though. Get some drinks ready and I’ll meet you out on the deck.”<br><br>~*~<br><br>One by one, Hector unfolded a few chairs and placed them portside overlooking the shore. Meanwhile, Halley, with an ornate silver tray in hand, allotted drinks to the party, starting with a mint julep drink for Pleiades, which drew a concerned look from Hector.<br><br>“Uh, Hale, you—“<br><br>“Sam, relax, there’s no booze in it. I mix some bitchin’ nonalcoholic drinks, too.”<br><br>Hector expressed relief, and then raised an eyebrow. “Is that right?”<br><br>“Yeah, back in my bartendin' days the teetotalers and the designated drivers would tip me extra nice if I offered them somethin’ a bit swankier than just a cola.” Pleiades, examining the mint leaf garnishes curiously, took a sip and grinned while making an exuberant noise of content. Halley shot Hector a wink and a finger gun as she passed him a mai tai. “Looks like ya dude Halley’s still got it.”<br><br>As Halley finished passing out drinks, she noticed Hector fiddling with an antique teal radio he had placed on an upside-down crate next to his chair. “Puttin’ on some tunes?”<br><br>“Ah, no, it’s—“ Hector turned the knob carefully, static fading into various broadcasts and then back to static again. “It’s kind of a long shot, we’re pretty far out—“ He muttered a few curses under his breath while he twisted the knob further. “—gah, fuck—but maybe, maybe it’ll—“<br><br>“<i>…and as we gaze out…the northwestern horizon…</i>”<br><br>“Holy shit, no way!” Hector tuned the garbled voice into a resonant clarity. “It actually worked!”<br><br>“<i>…bserve Cygnus soaring gracefully across the night sky. Let us take a moment to—</i>“<br><br>Hector scowled, shook his head, and rolled his eyes. “Aww, we have like, the <i>worst</i> view of Cygnus down under, come on, dude.” He settled down in his chair, picked up his drink, and took a swig.<br><br>“What the heck is this?” Halley asked, taking a seat next to Hector and listening closely to the mellow, comforting voice drifting through the tinny speaker.<br><br>“Oh, it’s this radio show I’ve been getting into lately. Dude talks about stars and space; he’s quite a romantic about it. This is his evening show, <i>The Blue Hour with Navi Cassiopeia</i>.”<br><br>“<i>…so let us ponder the future of humanity, and the exciting opportunities it could bring if we manage to overcome the obstacles that lie up ahead. Out there, nestled in the wings of the swan lies a tiny little planet, designated Kepler-186f by NASA I believe, that orbits the star Deneb. This planet, you see, shares many similarities with our humble little Earth…</i>”<br></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">“I wonder what it’s actually like, out there...” Didn’t tipped her chin towards the night sky with a forlorn sigh, “I don’t know if there’s anywhere on earth I haven’t seen yet, and every bit of it, every living thing, every single moment, it’s all miraculous But hearing that there’s so much more, entire other earths to see, it makes my heart weep.”<br><br>She took another sip of her drink.<br><br>“This is really, reaaally good.I have no idea what it is, but I like it,” The wanderer took a light sip from her glass, savoring the flavor, “You know what this makes me want? I know this one French chef, he’s been making pastries his whole life. He’s so good they’ve got him making them for the king. And he makes the dough so flaky that it feels like you’re eating air, and so buttery that the richness sits on your tongue for minutes after you eat them. He makes these folded cheese-filled desserts...”<br><br>Didn’t sighed again, this time a much happier note.<br><br>“Just right- He gets the savory and sweet perfectly balanced. I wish we had a tray of those, fresh out of his oven,” She winked, “I might even share some with you guys!”<br><br>She sat forward in her seat, tipping it up on its front legs.<br><br>“How about you guys? What’s the best place you’ve ever ate?”</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Cendra</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Lorenna lay on her red beach towel on the deck. Her eyes were closed as she enjoyed the rocking of the boat. Listening to the voice through the hum of the radio was actually kind of relaxing as well. She didn't know the names of many of the stars or other heavenly bodies, but she was pretty familiar with their patterns. It was almost all the butterflies would talk about when they got ready to migrate. So, in a way it was something familiar taking her back home and to her childhood.<br><br>There was a gentle tickle on Lorenna's nose and she fought to hold back sneeze as a soft, but sad humming nudged at her mind. She chuckled and sent a gust of breath to shoo the small white winged creature off her nose. It fluttered in front of her face as the hum intensified. <br><br>“Alright, alright, lets see if we can get you some sugar water, huh?” She whispered. As she walked toward the group she could hear Didn't going on about her delicious food from a king's chef. She had to admit, she girl had a vivid imagination. <br><br>“That sure does sound yummy!” she said with a small smile as she came to stand next to person in question. <br><br>“Well, I've never eaten a place,” she winked at Didn't, “But I think my dad's cooking will always be the best food I've had. Even if it was a little rough when he first started his experimenting. We'll just say if there was a house somewhere made out of brick-bread, I wouldn't be surprised if he was their supplier at one point.” She giggled a little at the memory. White and black speckled wings of the butterfly pushed it off of Lorenna's hair. It fluttered around the group for a moment before it came to rest on the edge of Miriam's drink. <br><br>“Oh, that little guy has been hanging around me. I guess he got stranded on here when we took off.” Lorenna crouched down to observe the younger girl's glass. “I think he likes your mint.” She smiled fondly.  </div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Loogs</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Halley kicked back in her chair and sipped her mai tai casually. “Best place I ever ate at? Hm…” She started fiddling with her gold septum curl as she racked her brain for an answer. “Oh, I know!” Halley snapped her fingers and leaned forward. “There’s a place back in Pagong City—‘cross from where I grew up, little ma n’ pa operation, ya know—that’ll serve ya the best sinigang na bangus you’ll ever cram into yer mouth hole, hands down, mm-hmm.”<br><br>She closed her eyes, conjuring up a childhood memory of a piping hot bowl of the dish after a long day at school. “That fish stew ya had in there, Sam? Almost took me back. Pretty good stuff ya cooked there.”<br><br>Hector laughed. “Aww shucks, I’m flattered.”<br><br>“Whaddya say we get together again sometime and have ourselves a little potluck, Pinoy-style?”<br><br>“I’d say that sounds like a solid plan, Halley.”<br><br>“Haha, fuck yeah!” Halley and Hector sealed the deal with a high-five. “I’ll bring the lumpias, and for dessert we can make haluhalo for the kiddos.” She looked over at Pleiades and winked. Children ain’t that bad, so long as you got someone who knows what they’re doing as backup. <br><br>Then Halley glanced over at Lorenna and Didn’t. “Hey, you guys are invited too. Any pals of Sam are pals of mine.” She flashed them a thumbs up as she took another long swig of her drink.<br><br>Meanwhile, Pleiades was fascinated with the white butterfly hovering around her drink. “Ooooooh. Butterflies are so pretty.” She remained motionless and held her glass still, examining the insect now extending its proboscis to indulge in some of her drink. “Hey little guy, you like my drink? I’ll let you ha—“<br><br><i>BARK BARK BARK!</i><br><br>A barreling ball of fur knocked the drink out of Pleiades’ small hand and frightened away the poor butterfly. Her best dress now drenched in mint julep, the young girl screamed at the excitable mongrel lapping at the spill. “HARLOCK! STOOOOOP IT!!!” Harlock turned his attention to the fleeing butterfly, barking and chasing after his new friend and leaving the humans to clean up his aftermath.<br><br>Halley burst out in raucous laughter, and initially Hector joined her before being cowed by his daughter’s flinty glare. “DAAAAAAAAD!!!” Pleiades shrieked and burst into tears, unable to tolerate the chaos any longer.<br><br>“Oh, sailor, don’t cry, I’m sorry…” Hector knelt down to comfort her, wiping the tears from her cheeks. She wailed inconsolably in her father’s arms. “Come on, let’s get you changed into something dry and we’ll have Hale make you another drink.” They disappeared into the hatch together, leaving the three others on the deck.<br><br>Once Halley’s cackling died down, she realized that she had once again been left alone with the minors. “Ahaha… ha… oh. So, uh…” She picked up her glass to take another drink, a measure taken to buy herself a few extra seconds to think of something to say. “You, uh… You kids do anythin’ interesting in ya spare time?” Her eyes darted nervously, first at Didn’t, then at Lorenna, then back at Didn’t, and then at the hatch pleading silently for Hector to come back quickly. “You, uh… got any, uh… like, hobbies or anythin’?”<br></div></div>

Instead, the deck hand, Ari, was climbing out.  <br><br>They spoke as they brought their long lanky body onto the deck of the ship, "I finished getting the supplies stowed away for the voyage. There was a lot of noise top deck so I thought I'd see what was going on..." Very tall actually. When they'd made it all the way out of the hatch, they stood over six and a half feet tall even while hunched, and slightly embarrassed around all the strangers. <br><br>As the deck hand spoke, those watching could just catch a split tongue articulating their quiet words. They glanced at Didn't, Halley, and Lorenna all in turn with large green eyes that if you would first describe as cat eyes, but something about them just wasn't feline, "Hello..."<br><br><a href="/attachment/download/49"><img src="http://s28638.storage.proboards.com/3328638/t/3SsynNYDvWSljZmfDhue.jpg" alt="Sandersonias murderer.jpg"></a>     <a href="/attachment/download/50"><img src="http://s28638.storage.proboards.com/3328638/t/Cod1TpUxJ6yqAvSWbsIG.jpg" alt="12948353_10153519019277592_1480306828_o copy.jpg"></a><br><br><br><img src="" style="max-width:100%;" alt=""> </div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Hey, hey!" Didn't gestured to the manic canine as it bounded around the deck, "Pup! Dog! Warlock?"<br><br>The dog continued frolicking excitably, bumping into people's legs and knocking crates askew, just generally causing chaos. As it rounded a corner, paws scrabbling on the slippery deck, Didn't dove into its path, skidding on her knees. She caught Harlock by the bandana around his neck, spinning halfway around before she slowed him down.<br><br>"Hush, hush... Shhh-" Didn't put her free hand on the dog's chin, "You made Miriam cry... You really should settle down."<br><br>Didn't met the dog's gaze, a gesture that normally would be taken as a threat by any canine. However, Harlock's body seemingly went limp, his rump thumping down on the wooden deck as he sat involuntarily. His tail went still, his eyes losing focus.<br><br>"That's a good boy, Garlock... Warlock?" Didn't glanced over her shoulder, "What's his name again?"<br><br>It was then that Hector's deckhand appeared. Didn't merely craned her neck to take in the full height of the sailor, but otherwise seemed unsurprised by the lanky newcomer.<br><br>"Hello! I'm Didn't, in case you didn't know I'm Didn't?" </div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Well, it wasn’t Hector, but it was good enough for Halley. “Oh hey Ari, what’s up? Miracle seeing ya come out onto the deck. <i>This</i> dumb mongrel over here—“ Halley hooked a thumb in Harlock’s direction, “—crashed into Miri and her drink went flyin’—don’t tell Miri, but it was fuckin’ hysterical—so Sam took her inside to get changed.” Halley gulped down the last of her drink and stood up from her chair. At a solid 5’11, she still only came up to about Ari’s chin. “I made some drinks, ya want somethin’? I, uhh, I forget if yer old enough for booze…”<br><br>Finally, the hatch creaked open and Hector emerged with Pleiades, now wearing a comfy lavender T-shirt with a cartoony swordfish on it, and cherry red shorts. “Oh, Ari, you’re out and about! Nice to see you comin’ out to say hello!” Hector greeted them with a quick hug; even his large towering 6’5 build stood at just short of Ari’s nose. “These are our new friends Didn’t and Lauren, and Halley’s catching a ride with us to the Archipelago.”<br><br>“Hi Ari, how’s your snake doing? Can you bring it out so we can hold it, pleeeease?” Pleiades begged, trotting toward Ari with her hands clasped together.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Ari scrutinized the quiet Lauren and the small girl who they believed had called themselves Didn't? "Nice to meet you." None of them seemed outright threatening, and Ari trusted the captain's judge of character. The Sharhazad had carried many passengers in the short time Ari had been its first mate. <br><br>Satisfied, Ari gave Halley an answer, "Yeah, I'll take a drink." Though only seventeen, Ari had dedicated most of their childhood to living a life at sea. Only Hector and Pleiades were aware of this though. <br><br>Speaking of the captain, there he was with young Pleiades. Ari accepted the brief embrace with a small embarrassed smile, "Halley introduced us. It will be interesting going back to the Archipelago."<br><br>They let the captain take his seat before turning to Pleiades, "I don't know Mirriam..." They toyed with the girl, being sure to use the names they'd all agreed on beforehand, "Pilli is a rather shy fellow. And there are all these new people around." <br><br>"Pretty Please?" Implored Pleiades.<br><br>It was getting on past dusk. A nocturnal sort of fellow, Xochipilli would be starting to stretch his metaphorical legs about now, "All right." Ari gave a genuine smile now. And dropped down into a crouch. <br><br>Taking their right arm, Ari slid their palm against the deck in an intricate serpentine fashion that mirrored the snake tattoo wrapped around it that continued across Ari's chest and neck to stop just bellow their right eye. At unknown beats, they would thump the deck with the palm of their hand as they wound it in front of them. In the failing light, the sound summoned a black iridescent river from beneath a pile of rope near the ship's bow. The river wound itself across the deck to Ari, where everyone realized it was a large snake. Its powerful head slid right up to Ari's hand and continued to wrap and climb up their arm until the snake was perched comfily around Ari's shoulders. <br><br>Ari stayed kneeling so Pleiades could reach the shimmering reptile.<br><br>"This is Xochipilli, my oldest and closest friend." Ari introduced him to their passengers, "You may call him Pilli." <br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler2616895').toggle();if($('#spoiler2616895').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler2616895"> <br>OOC: Just for player knowledge, Ari is not just gender neutral or fluid, but just genuinely isn't sure what gender they are. I use 'they' to keep it easy and consistent while writing, but I also have characters that only call Ari she/her, or only him/hi, others like to switch it up in the same sentence or give nicknames. Ari answers to them all and likes to experiment with how they represent their gender and identity by patterning off others. (it's quiet cute) Ari's character growth comes from learning about themselves since they didn't get the chance to when they were younger. So I encourage you to have characters act accordingly. More will undoubtedly be revealed as we progress. :3<br><br>Xochipilli is a black goldenchild reticulate python. <br><br>P.S. Excited to be here!<br><br><br><br><br></div></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Didn’t bounded to her feet, and raised a hand in greeting to the serpent.<br><br>“Hi, Pilli, it’s great to meet you!” She attempted to touch the immense snake. Its glassy eyes went distant for a moment much like Harlock’s had, but it quickly regained focus. Xochipilli reared back, avoiding the girl’s touch. It twisted around Ari’s shoulders, quickly slithering around to put the deckhand between himself and Didn’t.<br><br>“Aw, he doesn’t like me...” Didn’t took a step back, crestfallen. She bit her lip, “I mean, you did say he was shy, but maybe he’ll warm up to me?”<br><br>Xochipilli, for his part, wound tighter around Ari’s arm, loose enough not to harm their dearest companion, but obviously unsettled. He kept his head level, warily eyeing her as if preparing to flee.<br><br>It was then that a nasty grinding crunch came from belowdeck. The entire ship rocked to the starboard, throwing people from their feet and sending boxes scraping across the deck. Didn’t bounced and rolled, slamming into the wooden rail hard. She slumped to the deck with a wheezing gasp, the wind knocked clear out of her.<br><br>As the more surefooted of the sailors clambered up from where they’d been flung, they saw a huge shadow beneath the waves, almost as long as the Shahrazad itself. The bulky aquatic beast turned away, plunging deeper beneath the surface. The leviathan flipped its sinuous tail, the fin shining a silvery grey as it broke the surface and doused the deck in a spray of salt water.<br><br>A moment later, it had vanished back into the depths, leaving the boat still rocking from the aftershocks of their collision.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Ari sprung into action, too occupied by the sudden threat to the ship to notice the disturbance between Xochipilli and Didn't.<br><br> "Go get the captain, first mate." Though Ari was technically the first mate of the Shahrazad, Pleiades was Ari's first mate, and the nickname had stuck. <br><br>While some of the other passengers were still clambering up, Ari was bounding towards the bow of the ship with Pilli winding alongside. They acted almost as one unit. At the front of the ship, Ari had flung open a dry box and was weaving slip knot after slip knot to the ends of five harpoons and corresponding floats. Taking the weapons, Ari climbed up and out onto the Shahrazad's draconic bowsprit. Pilli followed and kept Ari's bare ankles anchored to the ship, and the lines to the floats from tangling. <br><br>"I didn't get a good look at the size, and it might have just moved on, but just in case..." Ari's eyes roved the waves, "Plus, I bet we look pretty cool, huh Pilli?" They asked without ever looking up from the ocean. <br><br>Putting impressing people aside, Ari's first mission was to keep the Shahrazad and her occupants safe. </div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Hector charged out from below deck, a large harpoon gun decorated with embellishments similar to his Tiamat Blade in his hands, and a coil of rope around his arm. “CAPRICORN!” he shouted as he stormed over and looked over the railing, eyes scanning the water for any sign of the beastly threat.<br><br>Pleiades, though a bit startled, nodded and gathered the houseguests and the dog, rushing them toward the hatch. “Come on, we gotta get inside!” Aboard the Shahrazad, ‘Capricorn’ was code for a possible sea creature attack, and it was the cue for Ari and Pleiades to implement safety protocols while Hector went to engage the threat directly.<br><br>Hector quickly glanced over his shoulder at Ari. “You’re taking the forecastle?” Ari nodded dutifully. “Cool, I’ll take the quarterdeck then.” He took his position, and tied a safety line for himself around the mizzenmast. Once he was secured to the boat, he lifted his harpoon gun and pointed it at the water, ready to pull the trigger at the slightest splash of a tail.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Didn’t scrabbled to her feet. She paused to thoughtfully rub at a forming bruise on her lower back, wincing at the touch. Nothing broken, but she would probably be sore for- Well, until she wasn’t? Her musings were interrupted by the ship lurching forward with a loud crunch, like somebody had slammed on the brakes. Didn’t caught herself, taking a sturdy grip of the railing and a wide stance.<br><br>”It’s going after the keel!” One of the sailors called out. Hector- No, Sam, maybe? His voice carried a note of panicked protectiveness, like a man whose home was about to burn down. <br><br>It seemed like the crew were old hands at dealing with monster attacks, but Didn’t wasn’t going to let their hospitality go unreciprocated. When a sea serpent goes after your host, it was just good manners that you lent a hand. Like helping clean up the dishes after dinner.<br><br>“Let’s do this!” Didn’t reached under the back of her swimsuit top, and produced what appeared to be a toy magic wand with a clear sparkly star at its tip. She took the trinket in both hands, and raised it grimly until it was level with her eyes. With a flick of her thumb, Didn’t switched the device on. The star began glowing, and tinny, canned music began playing.<br><br>As a rendition of “Bippity-Boppity-Boo” that was just enough notes off to avoid copyright infringement chimed along, Didn’t switched her grip to a single hand, and began twirling the wand. The light from the star seemingly lingered in the air, forming a glowing cerulean wake. She began running along the deck, ducking past Hector and Ari, leaving a contrail behind her. Didn’t drew near the bow, and took a deep breath as she approached… This was going to be risky.<br><br>Didn’t bounded up onto the railing with a spin, and stumbled, teetering directly over the jaws of the gigantic fish below her. As she flailed her arms, she managed to grab hold of the trail of light her wand had left, as solid as a rock. Didn’t steadied herself against it, and took a deep breath. Tucking the wand away again, she clambered up onto the luminous platform she’d conjured.<br><br><i>Don’t think about the fact that there’s no boat beneath you, that if you fall, you’re going to get eaten…</i> Didn’t steadied herself on her precarious perch, and looked down at their attacker. It was a mammoth fish, easily longer and thicker than a schoolbus. Instead of the more typical fish anatomy, it had a long sinuous body lined with a single fin, above and below, like a colossal eel. The leviathan’s most distinctive trait however, was the solid bony armor plating that covered its head. The bone formed a cowl, sweeping forward from its gills and forming into a set of jaws resembling nothing more than an organic beartrap. The beast shifted and bit down again with an immense crunch, as the wood began splintering from its assault.<br><br>The girl untied her yo-yo with one hand. She closed one eye, then the other, trying to get an exact read on the distance between herself and the sea monster. Didn’t flicked her wrist, the yo-yo zipping down and then snapping back into her grasp.<br><br>No need for a shout, it would only take a thought- Didn’t lashed out towards the monster, the yo-yo’s cord far too short.<br><br><i>Overdrive</i>. The whirling cylinder instantly ballooned in size, its string exploding into a thick rope, and the yo-yo itself surging to the size of a millstone. It hit the waves with a hiss, showering the deck in seawater. The immense projectile plowed into the leviathan and sent a visible shockwave through the water.<br><br>The fish rolled away, its mask of bone marred with a large crack. It snapped it jaws ferociously, and lashed its tail, circling to find another angle of attack.<br><br>“It’s clear! Take the shot!” Didn’t snapped the yo-yo back into her grasp, already having dwindled it back to its normal size. </div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Hector was caught off guard by the gargantuan, flail-like weapon striking the leviathan’s armored head. <i>Who could be—</i> He turned around and spotted Didn’t swinging her yo-yo around the boat. She was shouting at him to make an attack, but Hector deferred the attack of opportunity to address the more pressing matter of the child who was now squarely in harm’s way. “Kid, what are you doing out here?! Get back inside, it’s too dangerous for—“<br><br>He came to regret taking his eyes off the aquatic beast when its tail slammed into the Shahrazad’s hull and sent him tumbling across the deck and hanging off the side of the boat by his lifeline. A rushing wave of water generated by the assault forced its way into his breathing passages, the salt of the ocean scraping against his throat as he clambered back aboard the ship and hacked out the water from his lungs.<br><br>Hector noticed his rope fraying in the middle from the sheer force of him being flung out of the boat. Another attack like that and the Shahrazad might actually capsize, taking everybody down with it. Close call. <i>This is bad. I’m not gonna take any chances.</i> The Tiamat harpoon gun started glowing in his hands, the divine power of the ancient artifact quickly spreading into his body. The blood red aura washed over his skin and lingered for a moment, before crackling violently and causing his skin to erupt and ossify into layered, lustrous crimson scales harder than diamond. Hector felt the changes racking his body and let out a strangled howl as he felt parallel slits carve into either side of his neck, gills forming within them. Fins protruded from his limbs, his back, and the sides of his torso, and his extremities became elongated, a thin membrane of webbing forming between his fingers and toes.<br><br><i>Aaah. I’ve done that for years now, and it never gets any less painful.</i> Just as he regained his composure from the intense transformation, Hector spotted a monstrous dorsal fin slicing through the surface of the water from the corner of his glassy, iridescent eye and trained his weapon on it. “Ari, heads up! It’s skimming the port side!”<br><br>Ari dashed over to the left with a harpoon in hand ready to launch. His deckhand was accounted for, but where was… “DIDN’T!” Hector scanned in every direction looking for any sign of the girl, but to his horror, she had vanished without a trace. <br><br>---<br><br>Below the deck, Halley, Lorenna, and Pleiades were huddled together in the shelter of the common room, clinging to the large sofa securely anchored to the ground. They felt an impact and the boat rolled to the side sending books and other objects flying off the shelves. Outside, the roar of the tumultuous waves reverberated in everyone’s ears. “Kiddo, are you sure we’re gonna be alright?” Halley squawked, gripping the armrest tightly and glancing over to Pleiades with a terrified expression on her face. Underneath the table in front of them, Harlock was trembling and whimpering with his paws over his face and his tail tucked firmly in between his legs.<br><br>“Yeah, my dad deals with this all the time.” Slightly less fazed, Pleiades pointed at the wall across from where they were seated. Flanked by a framed tempera painting of a fjord landscape (signed <i>Pleiades, August 2013, Tromsø, Norway</i>) and an Icelandic flag, a large orca skull hung stark and intimidating with runes carved into the bone in two straight lines down the center. “He said that skull is a good luck charm from a really powerful wizard and it keeps us safe from monsters.” Well, it was <i>supposed</i> to, at least. For years the talisman had been working as her father had promised it would, but in the heat of the moment Pleiades always feared that <i>this</i> time it wouldn’t be enough to stop the boat from sinking.<br><br>They heard a loud banging sound as the leviathan struck the boat again, followed by a cracking sound that made Pleiades’s stomach drop. It was the sound of wood splintering, one she was very familiar with—Dad’s kind of clumsy, he’s always punching holes in the wall accidentally with his elbow or banging his head on tables while retrieving a stray toy from underneath—but this was much louder than her father’s usual maladroit antics. Harlock yelped, barreled out from under the table, and leaped onto Pleiades’s lap. She wrapped her arms tight around the dog and buried her face in his wooly coat of fur. <i>I hope Dad and Ari are going to be okay…</i><br><br>“There’s gotta be something we can do to help!” Halley looked around the room for a weapon or something that could be used as one, but she knew that against a creature of such size and magnitude, she would be more of a liability than anything. <i>Wait a second…!</i> Suddenly struck with an idea, Halley plunged her hands into her messenger bag and began feeling around for something. She first pulled out an ornately carved wooden clock. <i>Nah, that’s not gonna work.</i> She shoved it back into her bag, and swapped it for a very expensive diamond-encrusted bottle of cognac aged several hundreds of years to perfection. <i>Wolfgang’s gonna kill me if anything happens to this thing.</i> Gingerly, Halley returned it to the bag’s bottomless confines and fished out another object. This time, her hand was grasping a palm-sized, polished bronze disc, something resembling a Roman numeral two etched into its surface, attached to a long chain.<br><br><i>The hell? I don’t remember accepting this for a delivery…</i> Halley remained fixated on the trinket for a few seconds. <i>This one of Fascere’s doodads? Did they forget to grab it outta here before they gave me this bag or somethin’?</i> She set it aside inside her pocket and continued her search for something useful to go out and help with. At last she procured, with some difficulty, what appeared to be a very large tranquilizer gun.<br><br>“Oh <i>hell yeah</i>, now we’re talkin’.” Halley examined the gun further, to figure out how to fire it. <i>The guys at Ruby Hydra said this thing was for huntin’ BIG big game like dragons and gryphons and shit… Their client’s not gonna be too thrilled when they get their shipment and they realize all the ammo’s gone… Fuck it, I’ll figure somethin’ out later.</i> She pulled out a few tranquilzer darts; the barrel was the size of a tall energy drink can and the needle akin to a rail spike.  Halley shook the dart, watching the fluid inside slosh around in the glass tube. It definitely looked like the kind of thing that could kiss a sea serpent goodnight.<br><br>She started loading the gun and turned to Pleiades, who had been wondering what exactly Halley had in mind. “I’m goin’ out to lend your pops a hand.”<br><br>“Halley, no! You’re gonna d—“ Before Pleiades could stop her, Halley scrambled out the door with the heavy tranquilizer gun slung over her scrawny shoulder. She was about to run after her but instead lost her footing and grabbed the table to catch herself as the boat staggered abruptly. Pleiades heard a dull thud and a clamor from the hallway, accompanied by an “I’M FINE!” and a rapid stomping growing more distant until she could barely hear the sound of the hatch door squeaking open.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">    Ari had stood shocked for a moment at Didn’t’s stunt until the captain’s warped commands rose over the Sharhazad’s railings. He must have transformed when he went over. In which case, he would be all right. <br>	A splash moments later, told the first mate that Didn’t was, in fact, NOT all right. Unless the child had some other fantastical tricks up her sleeve.<br>	<br><br>    “Shit!” Ari was already on the other side of the ship, “Pilli, get Didn’t.”<br>	<br><br>    There was a hiss of resistance. Xochipilli had not enjoyed his first encounter with the new passenger. She made his head foggy, and interrupted his bond with Ari, who could just as easily sense these thoughts.  <br> <br><br>  <i>  </i><i>	‘That's strange... but she hasn’t done us any harm. In fact, she’s only tried to help. She is a passenger of the Sharhazad. Please, go!’</i> <br>	Pilli acquiesced at Ari’s mental urging and parted ways to slip over the side of the ship, and plummet inelegantly into the foaming sea. There was a buzz in Ari’s mind where Pilli’s connection resided as the snake approached Didn't. Very interesting, but there was no time to waste.  <br>	<br><br><span>    </span>That was one thing taken care of. <br>	<br><br><span>    </span>Ari looked off the port and saw the leviathan flanking the Sharhazad for another strike, just as the Captain had said. It was a formidable creature. The floats were still attached to the harpoon ropes, but Ari wasn’t sure if they would be enough. No time like the present to find out. <br>Ari coiled up and raised the harpoon to strike as the beast swam into range.<br><br><span>    </span> They had just begun to feel that frozen moment of calm that settled into their body before the strike when the hatch to below decks slammed open. The tattooed woman came clambering out. Halley was her name, if Ari remembered correctly. <br>It was enough of a distraction for the fish to slam back into the Sharhazad, nearly causing Ari to be bucked over board, and sending Halley onto her side. Something went spinning across the deck from her hands. <br><br><span>    </span>There was another ominous creak from the ship that set Ari’s teeth on edge.<br>“Get back below deck! I’m not a damn babysitter!” Ari vented across to the prone Halley. <br><br><span>    </span><br>Ari’s command went ignored as Halley scrambled back up and after whatever it was she had dropped in the collision. <br><br><br><span>    </span>There was a large splash of water about fifteen meters off the port. The fish had circled back out for yet another strike, and Hector was no doubt doing his best out there. <br><br><span>    </span><br>Halley had found whatever it was she was looking for. She stood up holding a strange looking handgun, “Just trying to help!”<br><br><br><span>    </span>It took Ari a moment to realize what the gun truly was. Ari had seen few tranquilizer guns, and never one like that. It didn’t matter, because Halley was right. It was help, and Ari knew exactly what to do, “Stay there!” <br><br><br><span>    </span>Ari slapped a large hook from their belt onto the end of the rope in favor of the harpoon, gave it a couple of powerful preparatory swings and then cast it high into the rigging of the Sharhazad. The hook caught effortlessly on the gaff of the main mast. They coiled up once more, this time into the rope, and launched off across the main deck in a wide arc. They prayed Halley was a decent shot. <br><br><br><span>    Since making it topside, </span>Halley’s emotions had ranged from panicked, to relieved, to confusion, and finally over to disbelief in a matter of moments, but she stayed put, “What are you do-? Oh no! Oh hell no!” <br><br><br><span>    </span>The dismayed courier was swept off of her feet into Ari’s free arm. <br>They were flying back across the deck, “You wanted to help. Get ready to fire that thing.” <br><br><span>    </span><br>Still a tad shocked, Halley fumbled with the tranquilizer, unsure of how to fire it while swinging through the air in someone’s arm. <br><br><br><span>   </span> Ari gripped the railing with their toes to give another mighty push that sent them swinging out over turbulent water. <br>Halley gaped at the monstrous creature that was closing rapidly on the Sharhazad and the mutated Hector clinging madly to it. Missing this thing would be like missing the broad side of a barn. <br>At the apex of their swing, Halley fired at the beast beginning to crest out of the waves while trying not to imagine it jumping and swallowing them out of the air like mosquitos over a pond, or worse yet, hitting Hector with this thing!<br><br> <span>    </span>The two had no idea whether the tranquilizer had found its mark. They had been sent in an ear ringing wild spin back to the deck the moment Halley had pulled the trigger. <br><br><span>    Ari let go of Halley the moment they were back over the deck. The tumble across the deck shattered the numb pricks across her limp firing arm. Halley screamed. It was very much dislocated. <br><br></span><span>    Across the deck Ari had simultaneously skidded and crashed to a stop still clutching the rope. They hauled themself up and ran back over to Halley, "Are you okay?!"<br><br><span>    "My shoulder." Halley gritted out<br><br><span>    Ari breathed a fraction of relief. Dislocated shoulders was something they could handle. All that time swinging around on ropes, Ari knew all about dislocated shoulders, "Take a deep breath. I'm going to set it quickly."<br><br><span>    Halley's eye were wide with fear and pain, but she began to suck in air. There was the sickening sound of bones locking back into place. Halley's consciousness began to fade; the adrenaline fighting with the pain. <br><br><span>    Ari continued to keep Halley stabilized, only able to hold their breath and wait for either the fish to strike again, or Xochipilli and Didn't to reappear safely. </span></span></span></span></span><br></div></div>
