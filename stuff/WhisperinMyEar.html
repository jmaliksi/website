        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Wreckage was all that was left... Not literally, but figuratively. Her research was all gone, wasted by a group of hooligans. Her funding was reduced to chicken feed, punishment for a failure most grave. The respect her fellows had for her... Null and void. Gone away. Possibly for good. She sighed, and took another sip of her coffee. That's why she was here now... Venice, of all places. Following a lead. She balefully looked around, squinting into the sunlight of the perfect summer day.<br><br>A flicker of blue caught her eyes, and she snapped to attention, her eyes glowing eerily as she followed it through the crowd on the other side of the canal. It bobbed around in the midst of the masses, and started to turn a corner. Blaise slumped back in her seat. It was just a woman wearing a blue hat. Not the contact she needed to find here. Maybe it wasn't the right approach that she was taking? She began thinking of how to work a charm that would filter the light to help her better find the shade of hair the woman had in the photograph.<br><br>She held the photograph up, examining it again. Aqua blue locks, cut short with two neat braids in the bangs framing her face. Glasses sat on the bridge of her nose, her eyes an intense shade of cerulean... This girl, Aquara Oceanara, was the key to what she had been seeking. If she found her, she might be able to finally get some of that old glory back.<br><br>Meanwhile, many of the people passing by the small café took time to gawk at a seemingly uncaring woman, sitting at a table all alone in a meticulously clean lab coat. If they looked long enough, they'd notice the two thin, stoppered beakers in her hair, filled with some odd fluid. Subtlety and tact were things that Blaise had never researched on a social level.<br><br>OOC: Oddly enough, it seems that Chords became a launching point for many RPs. It's launched three thusfar, although in this one, it's second to the aftermath of Humanus.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message"><i>OOC - Really? What were the other two?<br><br>And you didn't reject Blaise after all! Niiiice. Now, do I bring Terrian in at some point and let them go at it, or do I overwork the King of Clubs by dragging him in and possibly establishing some connection between him and the Parmigianino Institute? Or do I throw in Rhometer and Higgledy-Piggledy for the hell of it once I can better understand what their effect would be on the topic? OR DO I DO SOME COMBINATION OF THE ABOVE. TIME WILL TELL.</i></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">OOC: Regardless of what you say Lee, I'm going to post anyway. =]<br><br>BIC:  Aquara stepped off of the ferry that just docked in beautiful Venice.  <br><br>"Did you have a nice trip Ma'am"  A man said with a heavy Italian accent.  <br><br>Smiling, ignoring the smell the filled her nostrils "Yes thank you" Bowing her head she walked off the wooden pier into the busy streets.  She procured a book from her back pocket.  <i>What is it I am looking for?</i>.  Aquara adjusted her glasses, and her beautiful blue eyes looked down the various streets that surrounded her.  <br><br>"Hmmm...." Aquara said softly to her self.  She ran her fingers through her short blue hair and itched her head.  She proceeded down the street full of people in front of her, passing a small open café.  She looked to her right, and seen a woman relaxing, seeming to be looking for a certain someone.  Shaking her head she continued forward looking for her destination. </div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"YOU!" The woman shouted, her voice intense and driven. She threw herself from her seat, grabbing Aquara by the shoulder, and barely dodging a punch that shot by her head with enough power to blow through a wall by jerking to the side. She ducked, avoiding another reflexive blow, this one a rising elbow that would have shattered her skull in multiple places. Jumping back, Blaise raised her hand to Aquara, hopefully stopping her from attacking.<br><br>"Sorry, my apologies. What occurred here was merely a misunderstanding, a most gruesome faux pas. Excuse my boorishness. It seems that I have been searching for an individual with a rather astounding resemblance to you in this very region, and my quest has grown rather beleaguering." Blaise paused, and inhaled deeply.<br><br>"Upon noticing you, I seized my opportunity, and ceased your movement in the most expeditious manner possible. Unfortunately, instead of conveying a burning desire to converse with you, I instead appeared to be some kind of deviant member of the proletariat or some manner of adversary to you... That is not my intent, as you have already perceived." She stopped this time biting her lip slightly. She attempted mentally to run an identification charm, only to have it fizzle.<br><br>"So it is indeed you. Aquara Oceanara. I am commonly called Blaise Euler, and am most delighted to have finally located you."<br><br>OOC: Verbosity is Blaise's game, as a few of you already know. I enjoy writing that portion of her personality, and will try to do it correctly from now on.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Aquara lowered her fists "Blaise Euler is that right? And what business do you have with me?"  She straightened her hair and adjusted her clothes.  <br><br>"I have business to attend here, why don't we talk and walk... its more efficient." <br><br>OOC: There isn't much for me to do here... </div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Efficiency. It would appear that you already have some notions as to the manner of person that I am, and they're faily accurate." Blaise smirked slightly, and waited for Aquara to indicate the direction that they were headed. Once she did, Blaise fell into stride beside her.<br><br>"Anyways, I've been receiving minute morsels of information about an event that occurred almost a year ago. Something called the Humanus Tournament, which I heard that you were in." Blaise's voice betrayed no emotion at this point, though her eyes had a spark to them.<br><br>"I found that I was able to scry on the precedings without mishap, but after the event had concluded, all of my attempts to locate any of the contestants were met with failure. This is most unfortunate, as I observed something about Flora Isobel, the swordswoman, that makes me most anxious, and I haven't been capable of divining her location." Blaise stopped talking, gasping for breath while she tried to maintain alongside Aquara's powerful, tireless strides.<br><br>"It was only by the most advantageous of happenstance that I saw your name on a list of flights to Venice. Figuring that you might have some inkling as towards the present whereabouts of Miss Isobel, I came here to inquire of you." Blaise's voice rose to a hopeful note at the end of the sentence.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Albatross Trevelyan</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Hmph... I do not know where Isobel is..." Aquara said hastening her walk, "Though, I wouldn't mind going up against her again."  Aquara let out a maniacal laugh, "I just love to fight, and the new moves I learned.  The techniques I've gained. Hahaha"  she lifted her hand to just outside her mouth.  "No one can beat me."  Aquara turned to Blaise, "Do you know how to fight Blaise, your dodging skills are excellent, but do you know how to fight when you have nothing to hold back." Smiling, "Ever since I was just a child; Martial arts has been a part of my life.  I mixed my techniques: Kick boxing, Gymnastics, Karate, Jujitsu, you name it, I have some sort of move in my arsenal!"  Laughing again, she stopped walking suddenly, "I am headed to an important Marine Science University here in Venice.  You can join me if you want, and we will discuss Isobel if like."  With that Aquara continued forward in her direction. </div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">OOC: Gonna wait for more entries for a little bit, and see what crops up.<br><br>Oh, and Photu, the three RPs to stem from Chords are as follows: Whisper in my Ear, Chains Lips and Voices, and Triannual. Chords was referenced in one other one, but it's not connected to that one's main plot.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">hermes</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Ryuu bumped in Aquara, with Aya right beside him. Aya gave the girl a 'perfect ten' evil eye. "Watch where you're going mortal." Aya said in a low voice, while Ryuu pulled himself to his feet, apologizing. "Sorry about that, I should have been paying more attention." He made a slight bow, "I'm Ryuu, and this is Aya." He said, then turned to Aya. "Can we please not kill anyone right now? It is crowded..." He said in a low voice.<br><br>Aya looked at him for a long moment, her expression softening, and eventually she nodded. Ryuu let out a shallow sigh of relief, and kissed her gentle on the forehead. "Thank you." He whispered, then turning back to Aquara and Blaise. "Um, I'm sorry if we got off on the wrong foot. How about I buy some coffee or something to make up for it?" He asked hopefully, standing protectively in front of Aya. Her silver hair and blood red cats eyes marked her clearly as a vampire, though she was from the noble class, anyone with interest in the supernatural could probably recognize that.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Albatross Trevelyan</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Aquara shook her head slightly, surprised by the sudden bump of a stranger... yet again.  "Excuse me," she said frustrated, "It seems that I am "running" into everyone today..." <br><br>Aquara accepted the apologies, though her reflexes almost getting the best of her, "Your lucky that I didn't react, I would've gotten very violent," Aquara laughed, "I already to an aggressive toward another individual, I think I have grown used to it by now." <br><br>"Coffee? If its alright with my newly met friend, then I would be more than happy to sit down for a cup of Joe." </div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"I'm not exactly the combatative type, I admit. Of course, such being said, it is not any indication of weakness on my part. First and foremost, Aquara, I am, and have always been, a researcher. There are many and diverse methods of observing my subjects, but the only manner that has satisfactorily achieved my projected goals is a first-hand approach," Blaise took a deep breath, and continued talking, seemingly unphased by Aquara's bravado.<br><br>"In rather more simplistic terms, I find that my line of research stipulates, on some level, that I be drawn in conflict with greater frequency than the typical individual. Thus, as logic dictates, I have honed my skills to a razor fine edge, to become better capable of carrying out my job." <br><br>"Most certainly, I would be delighted to accompany you on such an occasion!" Blaise paused, meeting Aquara's gaze for a moment. "Although the typical mundane science holds little mystique for those of us of a more mystical persuasion, biology still does not yield to our most advanced techniques willingly. Even I, with my intellectual leanings, have learned only the barest fundamentals of the field."<br><br>Blaise's rare moment of humility was interrupted by their collision. Deciding it would be for the best of Aquara handled the conflict, Blaise began evaluating the two that they had encountered. One was clearly some subspecies of vampire, although being active in the late afternoon and in a region with so much running water clearly eliminated the traditional Romanian archetype. The other individual had an odd aura about him that Blaise couldn't quite place. Blaise continued eyeballing him even after Aquara had made peace with them, watching for some sign of his supernatural capabilities.<br><br>"The appelation that is typically attributed to me is Blaise. Surname Euler. And although I would generally put my emphasis on expedience over pleasure, I suppose that I could deign to imbibing some sort of liquid peace offering," Blaise said, her tone cordial.<br><br>OOC: And yes, I know what she's saying. I only use words I know, though I think I played a little fast and loose with a few of them. <br><br>Photu should be joining pretty soon, so maybe we'll collide with him at our next stop.<br></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message"><i>OOC - Wait, I forgot how well this works for me. In fact this is exactly what I've always wanted to do. Okay, sweet. Introducing here a mechanic that Terrian and his Triannual duplicate have already hinted at rather heavily, and which they'll be explaining more fully at the end of that RP, I predict.</i><br><br>"So," said Terrian. "Let's see if this works."<br><br>He and his duplicate were standing in a tiny flat in Venice, surrounded by piles of books: Italian novels, books of poetry, plays, programmes from operas, travel guides, and every imaginable dictionary and lexicon of Italian. Terrian's duplicate was dressed simply. He had spent the last six months in this flat, living on little, exploring the city and its language. Terrian had come to visit not only to sample that knowledge, but to try something else.<br><br>"Very well," said the duplicate.<br><br>He took a step forward, precisely onto the point where Terrian was standing. In another instant, he wasn't there at all -- but Terrian's mind reeled with a thousand new memories -- reabsorbing a duplicate had never been such a shock -- it was as though an entire different life was being superimposed on his own. He stood for a moment and relished his new experiences: the gondolier who sang as he rowed, the merchants on the cobbled streets, the monasteries...<br><br>Then he remembered his goal. He sifted through the memories of this other Terrian, watching his actions, discerning his behavior. If left outside for that long, he had found, duplicates started to develop their own personalities. He wanted to reproduce that same personality in a new duplicate.<br><br>So he took a breath, and stepped forward. Behind him there was a duplicate.<br><br>"Come e?" Terrian asked.<br><br>The duplicate did not smile, but he said, "E perfetto."<br><br>* * *<br><br>And so the duplicate had stayed in his flat, to continue his studies, eventually to move elsewhere in Europe (Provence, perhaps, he said, to learn French), and after consideration Terrian had suggested it would be convenient if the duplicate took on a nickname, and apprehending that he was the first in a series the duplicate had christened himself Alpha.<br><br>Terrian was booked for a week in the city and would meet Alpha later in the day for dinner, but at the moment he was eager to test his new Italian fluency, and so he set off into Venice by himself. He had the empowering experience of ordering his coffee in perfect Italian, before settling into a chair outside the cafe and watching the passersby.<br><br>That was when he noticed four unusual-looking people walking together toward the cafe. One of them was almost supernaturally pale, and...<br><br>And. Shit.<br><br>"<i>Maledizione</i>," he muttered floridly, and hastened to move his chair around to the other side of the table, so as not to show his face to the newcomers, one of whom he recognized as none other than Blaise Euler. The crazy researcher from the Parmigianino Institute. Somehow, after he and a duplicate had annihilated her uplink and their friend Helen had knocked her unconscious, his hopes weren't high that she had fond memories of him.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Ryuus eye's flashed red, and his hair briefly tinted silver, as the young woman spoke. Though he quickly reasserted control over himself, brushing off her casual arrogance as impatience and ill temperment. "Well, I think this one would be already actually." He said, eyeing a cafe across from them, while restraining Aya with an arm on the shoulder.<br><br>"This table looks alright," Ryuu said, sitting down at a table across from a rather dashing young gentlemen who had a bit of a nervous look about him. Ryuu gave himself a mental shrug, and looked around for a waitress. A quick hand signal declared his intention to buy, and he turned back to his newfound guests. "So, what takes your fancy?" He asked politely.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Certainly. It's rather implausible that any other establishment convenient to our itinerary would have enough of an advantage in either frugality or excellence that it would be prudent to opt for them instead of our present, most immediate option," Blaise used her hands to sweep her lab coat under her as she took as seat beside Terrian.<br><br>"To be completely candid with you, I am quite lacking in preference when it comes to selecting fare to consume. In my... previous occupation, I seldom had much in the way of options beyond that of the greatest convenience," Blaise shrugged, the test tubes clicking together. Taking advantage of the pause that offering the selection of her drink to the others had offered, she leaned over to Terrian.<br><br>"I've observed you in your routine for the two weeks preceeding this one. Simulacrum, would it be an inconvenience for you to inform me of the next occasion upon which I would be capable of procuring a conference with your derivation? It's an issue of the utmost urgency," Blaise whispered, ignoring the reactions of the group around her to her seemingly random approach to a stranger.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Terrian, who had been staring raptly down at his cup of coffee, looked up slowly at Blaise Euler in the pretense not to have realized that her last wall of words had been directed at him. After rummaging through her statement as best as his short-term memory could reproduce it, Terrian came to the tentative conclusion that it didn't seem as though she was asking whether he'd prefer to be knifed in the chest or the neck. In fact, insofar as he could slog through her slew of ten-dollar words (he wasn't even clear what a "simulacrum" was, although it sounded vaguely like the kind of word he ought to know), Terrian thought she might be asking him for a meeting.<br><br>Still. That might translate to "When's the most convenient time I can throttle you and dump you into the canal?" So Terrian employed his signature cunning and presence of mind to produce the safest answer.<br><br>"Penso che vogliate qualcun'altro," he said brusquely, before turning his gaze back down to his coffee.<br><br><i>OOC: "I think you want someone else." Hopefully. I know of Italian only what I remember from a year of study when I was like ten, and what online dictionaries can confirm for me.</i></div></div>

Ryuu asked the young man, though he obviously understood and could likely speak English. He thought it most likely he wanted to avoid contact with the woman, though for what reason he couldn't fathom why. He smiled at Aya, motioning for her to sit down. "Why don't you put it on for a while? There is no great need for you to protect me now."<br><br>Aya scowled for a long moment, though she did it without rude contortions of her face, and finally nodded. Ryuu pulled a rosary from his pocket, and Aya draped it from her neck. The oppressive pressure that had been coming from her vanished, and her red eye's and silver hair turned a deep green, and a very light, nearly pink red respectively.<br><br>She smiled, darker aspects of her personality evaporating. She moved a chair closer to Ryuu, and clung to his arm defensively. Ryuu rolled his eye's and kissed her on the brow. "Its good to see you again." He said, Aya nodded vigorously, uncharacteristically ignoring everyone else while she focused on him. Ryuu nearly blushed, when the waiter came by. "Ah!" He said cheerfully, "Fragolina di bosco, da passare al filtro, ed nocciola da passare al filtro." He looked at the others, "And what would you all like?"<br><br>OOC: Ryuu first asks if Terrian is sure, and says that she seems quite sure of herself. (Not that exact wording.)<br>The order if for a Strawberry Filtered Coffee, which is Aya's favorite, and a Hazelnut Filtered Coffee, which Ryuu is quite fond of.</div></div>

She picked the menu up, holding it upside down, and flipping it over confusingly.  "I knew I should've read that manual on the way here..." Aquara paused tapping her chin thinking.  "How do I ask for a coffee again..." <br><br>Aquara turned to Ryuu, "Could ya place an order for me, I don't even know how to speak this language.  I want a coffee cake, and some french vanilla coffee..." she said with a friendly tone. </div></div>

A moment later, she responded to his statement.<br><br>"Doubtful. On both a genetic and spiritual level, you are virtually identical to the derivatives that he produced in a prior-" Blaise paused, realizing that the word 'conflict' would likely trip some kind of alarm bell for the gentleman. "Conference. So, it seems that your reticience is stemming from some other factor."<br><br>Blaise was growing impatient. She had recorded telepathic signals between Terrian and his copies during the incident, and this individual clearly had a subconscious telepathy routine up and running. Unless there was a whole race of people who were identical, and only certain ones with powers like Terrian, he should be admitting to something by now... She'd have to resort to magical force, soon, if he wasn't going to confess his connection.<br><br>OOC: Dangit, Blaise! Do you want to go in the scrap heap again?

        <div class="content"><div class="message"><i>OOC: Yay, Blaise! Do you want a pat on the head? Forget about what the common rabble does and think about nothing but Terrian! Anyway, time for him to realize something I've known since Blaise first spoke to him. I love having more knowledge than Terrian Brogue. That always leads to good times.</i><br><br>Terrian gently added sugar to his coffee and stirred it without looking at Blaise Euler. Clearly there was no convincing her she had the wrong guy. But... this phrase, "you are virtually identical to the derivatives that he produced"... Now Terrian could guess what "simulacrum" meant. She thought she was talking to a duplicate. In fact -- Terrian mentally shook himself, he should have picked up on this immediately -- that  bit about observing his routine -- she thought she was talking to Alpha. Having apparently concluded in her observations that Alpha wasn't the original, she now had no reason to suppose that the original himself should have come to Venice.<br><br>Terrian, whose mind always worked fastest when it was forced to improvise wildly, processed all this as he set his spoon down on the table. If Blaise Euler thought she was talking to a duplicate, well, that had to constitute an opportunity. For what exactly, it was too early to tell, but Terrian had pulled off enough scams in the last few years to know that any lie was a good lie if you didn't think it was the right time to tell the truth.<br><br>So when he finally looked back at Blaise Euler, his response was, "Okay.

To the others, it would sound like she was speaking about pointless drivel with the man, instead of her intentions. She always had to be cautious about them.<br><br>"The most expedient way to state it is that your archetype has accrued a significant debt with me. His antics at the Parmigianino Institute essentially annhilated virtually a year of confirmed information, and if you were erudite when it came to the behaviors of researchers of the paranormal-" Blaise clenched her fist, "You'd know that beyond the initial data repository, we seldom duplicate our work until it is ready to be published. Piracy is too prevalent for any other manner of conduct. And it just so happened that Mister Brogue struck right before I was prepared to conclude my studies."<br><br>"In a simpler manner of speaking, omitting the cause of my grievances against him, Terrian Brogue owes me several months of labor, or at least significant aid in my studies," Blaise tried to look him in the eyes, to see what his true opinion was on the situation.<br><br>OOC: BLAISE, LOOK AROUND YOU. GO PLAY WITH AQUARA. SHE'S A NICE GIRL. STOP MESSING WITH THIS TERRIAN FELLOW.<br><br>Terrian is good at hijacking RPs, isn't he?

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Ryuu snapped his fingers in front of Blaise face, "Sorry, we all appericiate your need to keep things private under those circumstances. But I have twofold comments to make. First of all, everyone at this table has a supernatural level of ability. Which generally includes hearing, so if you want to have a personal chat, I'd suggest crossing the street." He said, shrugging helplessly.<br><br>"Two," Aya continued for Ryuu, "This man is flesh and blood. If he was a construct, Ryuu and I wouldn't be tempted to feed on him." Ryuu nudged her sharply in the ribs, no need to tell everyone at the table he was some weird vampire metamorphasis case. She grunted, and blushed. "Sorry," She whispered, sitting back down. In this instance, it was so incredably low, it was really only Ryuu who heard her.<br><br>Ryuu gave the waitress Aquara's order, then scratched at his head as she walked off.<br>"As for matters of debt. You do supernatural research, I don't find it unlikely your base was trashed for good reason. I've had my own bad experiences with that type of lab and research, so I'm afraid I'm inclined to support whatever action this man, Terrian was it? Whatever Terrian decides to do about the situation." Ryuu smiled as the waitress returned with the coffee, "Ah, grazie!" He passed the coffee's to Aquara and Aya respectively, and sat silently sipping his own for a moment.<br><br>"So," He said, addressing himself to Terrian, "What do you wish to do?"</div></div>

He was now sitting at a cafe table in Venice with a paranormal scientist who wanted to keep him as her pet for a few months, two -- vampires or werewolves or <i>something</i> that went bump in the night -- and another lady who looked nice enough but who was probably going to turn out to be, shit, some kind of psycho ninja assassin at this point.<br><br>Then he remembered what exactly the pale man had just asked him.

Aya sighed, "You never let me have any fun." She put the rosary back on.<br><br>Ryuu shook his head, his arm around her. He looked down at Terrian, "Uh, look. She likes the hunt. If you run away scared, she's gonna chase ya and bite ya. Just because its fun for her. She won't kill you though, neither will I. We, uh, well we're not stupid. Some are, but we aren't. There's no reason to kill a human you feed on, blood sustains us, not life." He shrugged helplessly, then leaned over.<br><br>"Just for the record, I'm not technically a vampire. I still prefer steak, beef, pork, good stuff. Anyways seriously, back to the table, unless your good with Aya making you a blood donor. And I should point out, either of us could easily catch you, no matter how desperately you run." He helped Terrian to his feet. "Your best bet here, is just to lose your fear of her."

"This so rich, and it practially melts in your mouth..." Aquara said seemingly undisturbed by the fact that two supposed vampires had just disappeared from the table. <br><br>"So," Aquara said directed at Blaise, "You wanna keep that--er--Terrian guy as a researcher for a few months?" She snickered, "It doesn't seem likely that an orginization wouldn't leave some form of copy tabulations of there research.  It seems as that is a 'unwise' choice on your part." Aquara sipped at her coffee gently, as not to burn her lips or tongue, "It seems that, you should let him off easily, because it is his fault that he destroyed research, but it should've been the responsibility of the institute to make records of any important pieces of information."</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">hermes</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"That is to say," Ryuu said, continuing for Aquara as he basically force marched Terrian back to the table. "That its your own damn fault for not backing up your research to a personal hard drive or the like. Keep it in a vault if you feel...insecure. But the only way to be assured of data's continued existence is to make copies." He shrugged, "Security or progress hmmm?" He then rolled his eye's, "Why didn't you store the data to an arcane log anyways? You can't destroy what exists in a seperate dimension. Or, not accidentally, and not without great effort."</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"You all seem to be incapable of comprehending the predicament. When dealing in the arcane, knowledge is quite literally power, the most potent device for virtually any task imaginable. Obviously for any individual that is capable of summating two addends, that means that any mage interested in turning a profit needs only to turn their pursuits towards privateering."<br><br>"You seem to be of the opine that it's a small feat to barricade information against intruders, but nothing could be any more remote from the actual situation. I must shield my data against individuals who can be anywhere, who are capable of doing anything. While transdimensional storage may be a hinderance to the typical human hacker, for those of a less mundane persuasion, it's trivial," Blaise ignored her coffee, the drink going cold as she rambled on about security.<br><br>"Mayhaps the best way to demonstrate the concept for you is a comparison that colludes somewhere between the experiences of the present parties. Magic is a hybrid of martial arts and modern computer science. It is akin to martial arts in that it is a learned course of actions, taught to be remembered, not a tool for instant use. However, on the other hand, like the modern advent of digital technology, it grows exponentially in both overall capacity and versatility."<br><br>"A new school of magic, when created, is a significant event. Just from the individuals wishing to be educated in said school, one could become wealthy enough to never need to work again. Include the teachers of older schools, compensating the creator for the use of her research to improve and solidify their own methods, and it becomes worth more than most people could even begin to fathom," Blaise took a sip of her coffee, not caring about its taste or temperature. She just needed to wet her lips so that she could continue her speach.<br><br>"With that stated, it only makes sense to fortify one's notes as much as one is capable. My clipboard, the center of such wards, was always on hand and secure against theft. Any duplications would just have been more vulnerabilities to exploit."<br><br>"Essentially, when all is said and done, this man's progenitor did the equivalent of immolating the manual for a new style of martial arts and the blueprints for a new line of computer while breaking into my residence," Blaise stopped speaking, her chest heaving from talking for so long with such rapidity. She took a swig of her drink, and wiped her lips with a napkin.<br><br>"I still retain a majority of the information in my mind, but due to the neccessary steps to submit a school to the High Guild of Mages, I have been impeded in my progress by several months."<br><br>OOC: BLAISE, STOP BEING SO MOUTHY!

"Vampires? Really?"<br><br>After the man helped him back into his seat, Terrian picked up his mug, realized he had already finished the coffee, set the mug back down, and looked at the man. "So, hey, listen, I forgot to thank you for telling me that you're -- what was it? -- inclined to support whatever action I choose. Really nice thing to say. But. Now stop me if you hear anything you don't like. Considering the fact that you've manhandled me, threatened me with bodily harm, and blown my cover <i>twice</i> all within the past five minutes, I feel like telling me how supportive you are of me makes you into something of a <i>giant raging hypocrite</i>."<br><br>Terrian's eyes passed over the other vampire and the silent woman, who still seemed nice but you just could not tell these days, and he looked to Blaise. She, if no one else, had probably parsed out the confession hidden within his gripe about having his lies exposed twice. Just to be sure, Terrian clarified, with a gracious smile even, for no other reason than to spite the man. <br><br>"Blaise Euler," he said. "The original. At your command."<br><br>Without breaking either his gaze or his smile, he added, "And for the record, my duplicates are shocked and <i>horrified</i> by the accusation that they wouldn't taste good."</div></div>

There is no diplomatic clout to gain with us by claiming such a thing, but rather, quite the opposite," Blaise closed her lips tightly, walked directly up to Terrian, and put her hand against his forehead roughly. She paused, her eyes moving back and forth for a moment, before turning away from him again.<br><br>"Verified. It does seem that we are dealing with genuine article. It was the utmost folly for me to presume that because the doppleganger wasn't authentic upon my first scan that it was not neccessary to scan 'Terrians' again upon each encounter.

However, I'm exerting my authority to demand that you accompany me for at least our excursion today."<br><br>"Aquara is correct.

Taking initiative, she headed down the main street of the city, heading towards one of the largest buildings apparent in Venice.  Aquara feet were lightly stepping over the bricks in the road, which made the streets of city, to keep its antique look.  <br><br>"Watch out, if you step on the white ones, you die!" Aquara said smiling.  She jumped backwards expertly, and landed on one foot, on a red brick a few feet back.  "We should arrive at the college shortly"  she said reassuringly.</div></div>

He didn't really mind.<br><br>Ryuu carefully kept an eye on Terrian. He knew the boy didn't want any help, from him lease of all, but he felt compelled to watch out for him despite that. This Blaise character didn't seem to be remotely trustworthy, and Ryuu had a suspicion that Blaises curiosity might stray outside of the purely academic and into the more harmful variety.<br><br>The kind that involved copius amounts of blood, screaming, and vivisection. Ryuu's eyes flashed red for a moment, then subsided to their normal color. He shrugged, the cracked his neck, and ventured a question. "So why are we headed to the college anyways?

If the situation is as I have perceived, then said individual is the subject to such an assortment of heavy-handed obscuration enchantments against the utilization of scrying that it may very well be more efficient to utilize a mundane exploration of Venice to acquire her location,” Blaise produced a polaroid photograph from her pocket, and then handed it to Terrian.<br><br>A woman, apparently in her early thirties, was striking a dynamic pose, sword extended. She was apparently at the pinnacle of physical condition, her muscles toned well, and her figure bordering on an inhuman perfection. Her eyes blazed with battle-lust, a large golden hilted saber clutched in one of her gloved hands. Her hair, curly black and down to the middle of her back, was secured into a ponytail with a leather cord. At the edge of the frame was what appeared to be a defeated opponent, a thoroughly muscled man gaping in awe at his now empty hand, a gigantic cleaver of a blade lying on the floor beside him.<br><br>“That was the best image of her that I managed to persuade her younger sibling to part with. I explained to her that I was amongst the ranks of the local police organization, and the head of the investigation into her sister’s disappearance,” Blaise paused, looking around to see if any of her comrades took objection to such deceit.<br><br>“Anyways, the woman in the photograph is Flora Isobel. She is a master rank fencer that was famous worldwide, but disappeared after the event called the Humanus Tournament. Her age is thirty-seven, her birthdate is October Sixth, at five-oh-two AM. As of her evaporation into the unknown, she was one point seven nine seven meters tall, and had a weight of fifty five point fournineseven kilograms. Her cornea are a shade of cornflower blue, and the impression of the friction ridges on her digits was left loop. Her favorite meal was homemade conchiglie with squid ink, prepared with a shellfish sauce according to her now deceased mother’s recipes, served with a small glass of Chardonnay from the Piedmont province,” Blaise spieled, then licked her lips, wetting them.<br><br>“I trust that you’ve committed all of her identifying characteristics to memory, Mister Brogue. It would be prudent to show our companions Ryu and Aya the photograph, as they have not yet made the acquaintance of the woman.”<br><br>“The reason why this expedition necessitates your assistance, Terrian, is as I have declared earlier. Due to my arcane perusal of Venice, and even the planet as whole, having failed, that leaves me the solitary prerogative of… as the mundane state it, ‘schlepping’ about this metropolis until I happen upon Miss Isobel.”<br><br>“And who better to coordinate such an exploit than you yourself? Having verified yourself to be a master of such things at the Parmigianino Institute, your cooperation may prove the difference between success and failure,” Blaise paused as the group happened upon the entrance to the college. Two gigantic marble sculptures of dolphins supporting fish upon their noses flanked an immense white gate, hewn from the same stone as the statues. Blaise gestured for the others, Aquara striding ahead of her.<br><br>“Besides, Mister Brogue? If I were to be unsuccessful at being reinstated at the Institute due to a lack of results in my investigation here, I’m quite positive that my superiors would consider the whereabouts of the owner of a certain mystically enhanced handgun to also be of interest.”<br><br>OOC: Oh, Blaise, so hard, and yet so rewarding to write.

For all you know, <i>any</i> handsome devil could have made off with that gun," said Terrian, raising his hands in a gesture of mock denial. He knew he wasn't going to fool Blaise Euler with that comeback, and of course he understood that she was making a legitimate threat. But he couldn't help himself; he said it anyway. Why expose the ugly truth when he could brush it away with a joke instead?<br><br>Besides, Terrian was starting to see redeeming qualities in speaking with Blaise. She seemed to have positively no sense of humor whatsoever, but there was fun to be had there. He would play along with her for the moment. Why not? It amused him.<br><br><i>And there you go,</i> that familiar voice in his head started off, <i>making believe you're in control of the situation, just to console yourself. You didn't miss the part where she basically claimed your soul, did you?</i><br><br>Fair enough, but Terrian thought Blaise would be willing to see reason on this point. If he could persuade her to settle for a duplicate in the long term instead of the original, he could fulfill his debt to her and still walk free. And now that he thought of it... wouldn't she and Alpha just fall head-over-heels for each other?<br><br>So he'd help her out on this one. Whatever the feelings between them, he figured he could at least trust her. Which was less than Terrian could say of the two spooks. He cast a wary eye over the pair of them as the group passed into the shadows cast by the giant dolphins.

We're both quite capable of enjoying a steak, its only our predatory nature that compels us to drink human blood." He gestured back at Aya, "And that's mostly her anyways, I'm still human. Mostly." He frowned, and sighed, once against thinking about his unique and highly complicated position. Aya then distracted him, by biting slowly into his neck.<br><br>Ryuu tried to cast a look at her, but she was busy. He cast an apologetic look on Terrian. "Sorry, she isn't very sensative, she mostly considers humans to be lesser species. But in any case, this demonstrates a good point, being bitten by one of us won't harm you in any manner." He raised his hand as the objections came to Terrians lips, "We aren't going to bite you, and you wouldn't turn into a vampire if we did. You're thinking of the common scum that inhabit this planet. She's different."<br><br>Ryuu didn't need to be a telepath to catch Terrians next thought. <i>What about you?</i> Ryuu smiled, and poked Aya several times in the forehead, to dislodge her. "I'm am what I am, not because she took from me, but because she gave to me. Without her, I'd be dead, and we wouldn't be having this discussion." He said, slipping his arm around her waist.<br><br>"As for you," Ryuu said, looking at Aya. "If you drain much more I'll pass out." Aya licked her lips and wrinkled her nose at him, "Its your own fault for tasting so good." Ryuu rolled his eye's, and moved to walk more evenly with Blaise. "I'd just like to inform you, that if any harm comes to that boy, I will not hesitate to kill you. No stolen object is worth a man's lifeblood. I will be staying around to make sure that he does remain unharmed." He looked at Blaise with red eye's, "I hope I've made my point."<br><br>He fell back beside Aya, and resumed a thoughtful silence.</div></div>

Aquara adjusted her jacket, and stepped into the swiveling doors, proceeding to the lobby of the establishment. <br><br>As usual, the college was full of spry young students, carrying books of sorts, some even freshman's, glancing at brochures that lined the lobby.  Aquara picked one up, linked to there Marine Biological studies.  "It says here, that we are to head," Aquara said pointing down a random hallway, "There, down to the left, make another left, go down that hallway, and make a right.

However, if you're being totally forthright about the magnitude of the aquatic menagerie maintained here, it appears that even one such as myself would be able to attain quite a large parcel of fresh observations," Though her smug, self centerred ways hadn't changed, there was a glimmer of childish excitement in Blaise's eyes.<br><br>OOC: Blaise, back, beligerent, bitchy.

She's my buddy. We go way back. Right, Blaise?" He cuffed Blaise weakly on the arm. She responded with a steely stare.

That, still, does not give base for the assumption that you will not incur injuries in the duration of your repayment," Blaise produced two items from her pockets, apparently a small notepad and some kind of flash drive. She palmed them as they entered the main aquarium enclosure.<br><br>"Naturally, I would not deliberately mar your physical, mental, or spiritual aspects. However, do not denounce me as some manner of equivocator if you incidentally pulverize a digit." Blaise settled her coat about her like a roosting bird, seemingly drawing into herself while the white fabric rumpled up around her.<br><br>"I must confess... This is resoundingly more resplendent than what I had been anticipating. It appears that although the outside architecture is merely servicable with the most basic of flourishes, whomever crafted this chamber evidently had quite the artistic muse, bordering on afflatus," Blaise glanced around the room, her trained eyes noting the contours of the gigantic enclosure, and the many subtle details that had been worked in. The water had many varieties of tropical fish swimming about, swirling patterns of vibrant life.<br><br>Living coral was at the bottom of the tank, forming a sort of miniature atoll that the room itself was centered around. A platform of white and transparent blue tiles encircled the water, the tank itself extending beneath it, as was visible under their feet. A clear wall, made of thick glass, rose up along most of the inside edge, allowing the students and visitors alike to lean over the gently sloshing waters. Cerulean walls rose up, gradually tapering inwards, finally shading into a glass dome that crested the structure. A compass rose was etched into the glass of the massive central pane, ornate lines spiraling about it and a solar face beaming down from the very core of the etching. Blaise ran her tongue along her teeth, casting an irate glance skywards. They were an hour too late, the sun being off center to the elaborate display, and now courting the western point of the design.<br><br>A central platform, crafted from a smoky white glass, sat over the middle of the atoll. Four cables, each a vibrant white and the thickness of a grown man’s arm, lashed out from each compass direction, anchoring it from the walls. Two similar lines extended down to the main platform, ten feet below, with a series of stairlike treads between them.<br><br>“You had been selected to perform a lecture here, no? It seems that I have underestimated much about both the people here, and your expertise… To craft such a locale, purely by utilizing mundane means…” Blaise seemed distant until Aquara’s comment snapped her back to the matter at hand.<br><br>“Well, indubitably, yes. Her locale is the most necessary, after all, but I would also be greatly appreciative if I could fathom more of the state that she was in upon your last moments together. I could effortlessly scry on the events of the tournament up until she declared her desideratum, and then all manner of anarchic interference set in upon all of the reads I was receiving…” Blaise clicked her tongue.<br><br>“So now you have understanding of why I require your assistance. Of all of the participants present and conscious for the end of the ceremonies, you’re the only one that I could discern to be accessible, reliable, intelligent, and possibly cooperative. Whatever observations you managed to gather in those few moments… This, I abjectly solicit of you.” Blaise met Aquara’s gaze, and then lowered her eyes. Her voice was lower, and more humble, than it had been yet today.</div></div>

He did all his best counting on them. Besides, if Terrian had a nickel for every time the Yakuza had threatened to cut off one of his fingers... Well, he wouldn't have any nickels but he <i>would</i> still be sporting a full set of digits and that was basically how he foresaw things staying.<br><br>He was awe of the room; it was probably the most expensive feat of architecture and decorating he had ever seen. But -- really -- it was wrong to even draw comparison between this place and the expensive joints he'd seen in his time. With those, all the opulence had served no purpose but to show off how much money the owners were reeling in... Terrian could see that the splendor here, in this room, was in service of a higher ideal.<br><br>He couldn't help himself. As much as he wanted to take in every detail of the architecture, he couldn't keep his eyes away from the fish. He rushed to the inner wall and pressed his hands against the glass, beaming. A flat, arrowhead-shaped beauty, some kind of angelfish perhaps, was pecking about in the upper coral. Its black scales were set about with alternating white and electric-blue rings that concentrated around a point near the back fin. A little neon gem. If not for the glass and Terrian's resolution not to lose any fingers, he would have reached out to tickle it.<br><br><i>OOC: It's an <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://40.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lsbqow34EK1qm9r09o1_500.jpg">emperor angelfish</a> for the curious.

He sighed again, the woman didn't care about anyone but herself. Until she'd met him anyways, she was interesting, cold, self concerned, and almost certainly evil. <br><br>We make such a great match, Ryuu thought sarcastically. At least she doesn't really want to bite Terrian, that'd really freak him out. Plus he doesn't exactly smell like a feast....<br><br>"Do you ever shower?" Ryuu asked suddenly, "Or have you recently been exposed to something rank? Because seriously, you stink, or maybe thats just the fish..."<br><br>Ryuu shrugged thoughtfully, a little confused now.<br><br>"Oh by the way, Aya is on the ceiling, she may be contemplating a prank or something of the like, so be careful."</div></div>

Snapping her fingers, “The Lord of the Lamp.  Well, if memory serves she wished for something called…”  Aquara had to pause again and try and remember what it was that she wished for, “Ah, yes, Omniscience.  Well, the Lord of the supposed lamp, was kind of… an, well, you get the idea.  He provided no protection, mentally, and it caused Flora to freak out, and become catatonic.” Aquara said, talking somewhat with her hands, waving them about, “After all that, we were poofed back to normal life,” Snapping her fingers, “Just. Like. That.” <br><br>Aquara checked the clock on the distant wall, “It appears that my Lecture is to start, if you will excuse me” She reached the podium, looking at a bunch of empty chairs.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">“I appreciate your assistance, Ms. Oceanara. It appears that I am currently indebted to you,” Blaise smiled faintly.<br><br>“This information… I had surmised as such from my solitary scrying and investigation into such matters, but I found a confirmation from a party attending said events to be necessary to the verification. Illusions and other such duplicitous actions are simplistic to enact when it comes to arcane viewing. As atypical a view as it may be for me to evince, typically, it is best for the mundane eye to bear witness.” <br><br>“Now that I have procured this information, I should be able to proceed to the next objective,” Blaise slipped a hand into one of the pockets of her lab coat, and started to turn away from Aquara, “As should you, I suppose. Naturally, I can understand the priorities of a woman of academia, and a such, will not begrudge your rights to carry out an intellectual discourse. Do go on. I shall be taking notes.”<br><br>Blaise turned on her heel now, resuming her momentum. She came up behind Terrian, who was regarding something slimy and brightly colored beneath the glass. She put a hand on his shoulder, eliciting a surprised reaction from the man.<br><br>“Mr. Brogue, I do believe that it would only be equitable for the compensation of my dispossession to begin at this present time. I, as implied earlier, would enjoy partaking in the lecture that Aquara is holding very soon,” Blaise pulled her hand from her pocket, revealing a small grey bar.<br><br>“As such, I impart the next process in our hunt for Flora Isobel to you.” Blaise offered the device to Terrian, pushing it roughly into his palm after a moment of hesitation.<br><br>“Your task is to locate a computer with a Universal Serial Bus, or USB, port, and to affix this jump drive to it. Assuming that said computer is internet capable, said drive should otherwise handle the task automatically.”<br><br>“Upon completion, you are to return here.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Terrian held up the gray device to inspection, then pocketed it. "Actually, you know what, I'd kind of like to hear her stuff too," he said. "I'll leave a duplicate here. He'll pass the word on to you if I come up with any problems, yeah?" At Blaise's accepting nod, Terrian smiled. "Okay then. Wish me luck! For <i>who knows what horrors might lurk within these</i> all right all right, here I go."<br><br>Students, faculty, and other attendees were moving into the room and seating themselves before the suspended podium. One young man, joking with a few of his friends, carried an open book bag. Terrian cast a quick glance inside as he drew near. There was a small ringed notebook protruding out. Perfect. While pushing past, Terrian discreetly plucked it out of the bag and tucked it into his jacket.<br><br>Once out of the room, he moved around a corner and out of sight. A duplicate emerged and, with a wave, promptly started pushing right back into the room to rejoin Blaise.<br><br>To give the dupe enough time to settle into place, Terrian stayed another moment around the corner. He took out the notebook and examined it. Well-worn. Covered in messy Italian handwriting. Also a few rough sketches that seemed to depict layers of something or other, marked off with long words. Terrian frowned, trying to put his newly-acquired Italian skills to use. This penmanship clearly wasn't meant for anyone's benefit but the writer's... But Terrian could make out a decent amount. The notes were for a marine geology class.<br><br>Fair enough. Silently singing the praises of the diligent Alpha, Terrian ripped all the pages out of the rings and discarded the latter. He tucked the crumpled pages back into his jacket. He was now a fresh-faced young professor of geology here at the Marine Science Institute.<br><br>He looked up at the signs hanging over the intersections between halls. Why, there was a computer lab not too far from the aquarium. Following the signs, he returned part of the way they'd come in, then turned off onto a new hall. Computer lab, just up ahead. Perfect. And... As he approached, he saw a black-haired girl swiping a card in order to unlock the door. <br><br>Terrian stopped short. Less perfect. Should have tried to nick someone's school ID back in the aquarium. He looked around. Oh. All right.<br><br>He hurried up to the elderly security guard who had just emerged from a bathroom. "Listen -- hi, sorry, excuse me -- want to do me a huge favor and let me into the lab? I think I left my card in the apartment."<br><br>The guard blinked. "What's your--?"<br><br>Terrian tactfully appeared not to have noticed this question and plowed on. He pulled out the disheveled notes and brandished them before the guard. "I'm running late. Got about forty-five minutes to type all these up into a Powerpoint for my next seminar. In <i>two languages</i>. You think you could help me out?"<br><br>Apropos of languages, it occurred to Terrian that English was probably not this gentleman's first. But that only seemed to have helped his pitch, because the security guard was obviously too taken aback to put up any more resistance. "Yes, of course," he got out, and led Terrian to the lab. He swiped his own card and opened the door. "There you go."<br><br>"Thank you so much," Terrian beamed. The security guard nodded and let the door shut. Terrian turned around.<br><br>Not exactly as impressive as the aquarium, but then how could it be. It was still a nice room, done up in a thematically appropriate blue-green hue. Reference bookshelves lined the walls, interspersed with large wave patterns in the wallpaper. Long, curving tables wound across the spacious floor, carrying what must have been about sixty computer terminals altogether. And, by the input window displayed on all of the unused monitors, a username and password were required. Another obstacle. But, unlike the door, he'd more or less budgeted for this one. Holding the notes in one hand, he approached the computer before which sat the black-haired girl whom he'd seen enter the lab earlier. She was wearing headphones, watching a video on the screen.<br><br>As he was walking past, his foot caught on one of the wheels of her rolling chair. He stumbled forward a bit and threw down the notes. They fluttered here and there, scattering all over the carpet.<br><br>"Ah, God!"<br><br>The student took off the headphones and looked around, startled. "Oh, I'm so sorry!" she said at once. As Terrian had guessed, there was a distinct Italian accent in her English.<br><br>"No no, it's all my fault. Wasn't looking where I was going. Christ..." Terrian ran a distressed hand through his hair and stooped down as if to begin picking up the notes. As soon as the girl had also leaned down in her chair to help, the distressed hand instead pulled the jump drive from his pocket and pushed it into one of the USB ports behind the monitor.<br><br>A light on the device glowed green. A small popup window appeared on the screen, entitled "Parmigianino.exe". Within the window, a status bar began to fill from black to blue.<br><br>"Really -- you don't have to help. Let me get those." But of course the student was resolved to help gather the dispersed, wrinkled papers. "No, seriously," Terrian said, "they're in kind of an order..."<br><br>"They're in order? Oh no," the girl said, looking at the sheets she'd already picked up. "I must have messed you up, then -- uh -- are these all right? They looked like they'd fallen together..."<br><br>Terrian stole a glance up at the screen. The progress bar wasn't even a fifth of the way complete.<br><br>He bent back down to the floor and looked over the handful of notes the girl was holding out. "Um, sort of. They need -- There it is. You want to just grab that one under the table? And..."</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Blaise turned away from the remnants of the group, and quickly set about procuring seating. A profusion of chairs had been arranged in orderly columns, facing towards the podium high above the water. Ms. Oceanara was ascending the steps with a consistent tread, each movement identical to the previous, albeit mirrored horizontally.<br><br>The scientist found an unoccupied vantage point near the front, and hastily seized it before a man with a white beard managed to fully descend. He ceased in midmotion, his shirttail brushing Blaise's lap. He muttered something in Italian under his breath, and then slowly rose up and hobbled away.<br><br>Blaise unfurled her notepad with a deft flick of her radiocarpal joint, revealing a page halfway filled with notes in flawless penmanship. She drew a graphite pencil from behind her right ear, the point fine down to a molecular level, and put it to paper.<br><br>“Good afternoon, everybody!” The microphone squealed loudly, and Aquara recoiled, her braids swinging. She leaned forwards again, and turned a knob a few degrees, “Sorry about that. Good afternoon!”<br><br>There was a few muttered greetings, but for the most part the audience was silent. It seemed less that they were unfriendly, and moreso that they just had been expecting a more formal introduction.<br><br>“I’m glad that I can be here today. I’m Aquara Oceanara, a field researcher from the southern coast of California. I’ve specialized in hands-on work with the larger predatory animals in the ocean, such as the Great White and orcas.”<br><br>“Hands on work?” A slightly derisive sounding comment came from the back.<br><br>“Yes. I’ve always felt that it’s unhealthy to pull animals out of the water in order to tag them, and that the stress could be harmful to individuals in already endangered species. So,” Aquara’s devilish glint returned to her eyes, “I go into the water with them, and do the measurements and tagging there.”<br><br>There was a brief moment of total quiescence. Somebody dropped a pen with a clatter. And with that, dozens of hands shot up.<br><br>“Yes, you in the front?”<br><br>“Have you ever been bitten?”<br><br>“Typically, no. Sometimes,” Aquara shifted her posture slightly, easing up, “Sometimes yes. When they go for you like a prey item, or get upset at something you've done, that’s when things get <i>really</i> interesting.”<br><br>"Of course, that's all somewhat moot for the more reasonable of us. Modern technology is making it possible to tag them and measure them without you going into the water, or the subject coming out. I'm sure, given a few more years, techies will have come up with some way for us to observe everything in the ocean without ever even going near the shore," Aquara leaned forwards on the podium.<br><br>"That's what really brings me here today. I'm speaking as a scientist, but not about the hard realms of science. This isn't about math or measurements or weather patterns or anything else so easily counted, so easily put into the realm of human comprehension. That's something they do an excellent job of teaching you here."<br><br>There were more murmurings from the student body, and some grim discussion amongst the staff. Blaise allowed herself a frown, betraying her substantial melancholy.<br><br>"I'm here to wake you all up. You're taught day in and day out about oceanography. It's routine. Get up, go to class, learn. You don't find yourselves gaping in wonder at the things you're studying."<br><br>Aquara stood up, and stretched with a loud sigh.<br><br>"Think about what we do every day. We, of all people, have no right to be apathetic. Astronomers can gaze into space for months, and never lay eye upon as much splendor and intricacy as you or I would find swimming about in a single cupful of seawater. The ocean, quite simply, is the greatest mystery and greatest wonder that humanity has ever, and may ever, encounter."<br><br>"What we do is a struggle against that fact. We dedicate our lives to straining the seas, pulling out what knowledge and data we can, and then filing it all away in books and papers. We do our best to fill out the hows and whys of everything that happens in the hydrosphere, without even thinking about the most important thing. We don't think 'Wow.'"<br><br>Aquara cleared her throat, the silence within the room almost unnerving.  "Taking this all into consideration one would try and glean the reason <i>why</i> the university has asked for me to speak to all of you today."  She peered throughout the room looking at all of the young students faces, some, filled with a visible inspiration, others skeptical.  "I'm here to tell all of you, that you can learn the hard facts of every species within the planet... but ask yourself, would you <i>truly</i> understand its purpose?" she paused, "Would you be able to combine concepts and facts to bring a true realization of the mysteries locked within the underwater realm?" </div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">At 96% complete, the student made to straighten up. “I think that’s all of it,” she said. Terrian nodded with an uneasy glance at the progress bar, but then let out a soft “Oh!” and pointed at the protruding corner of a final sheet of paper which he had, some seconds ago, discreetly slid beneath the tower case. As the student hurriedly stooped to retrieve the page, Terrian reached up and around to pull the flash drive out from behind the monitor. No sooner had the progress bar registered 100% than the program vanished off the screen and the little plastic ingot disappeared into his hand.<br><br>After tucking the drive into his pocket, Terrian accepted the pages the student had gathered. “Some of them are still out of order,” she cautioned.<br><br>“That’s fine, I’ll finish them off,” he said. “Thanks for helping.”<br><br>“Oh – no – I’m sorry,” said the student in her accented English. “I’d rolled out too far… I wasn’t paying attention. It’s my fault…”<br><br>“Forget it!” Terrian exclaimed. He reached out a hand again, this time for her to shake. “And if you’re still feeling guilty by next semester, well then you can make it up by taking the Marine Geo intro. As long as you can fit that in around Chem, I mean.” He punctuated this last comment with a rueful smile designed to suggest that he was well used to students being drawn away from majors in marine geology by the irresistible lure of the department of chemical oceanography.<br><br>“I hope so. It was nice to meet you, Professor Stockton!”<br><br>When the girl had seen him off with a gentle wave and equipped her headphones once more, Terrian retreated to a safe distance amid the sinuous tables and considered his options.<br><br>If there was one thing Terrian Brogue knew about himself, it was his limits and that was why he did not need to deliberate on the matter for more than an instant before admitting that it was <i>thoroughly</i> beyond his power to march the flash drive directly back to Blaise. No, the need to pop this bad boy into another computer and see just what it’d accomplished had caught any and all competing priorities in a steely vise grip. Who could say what information the drive had acquired during its brief connection to the Internet? Terrorist records? Bomb coordinates? <i>Secret Blaise files??</i> This was all too much for Terrian’s imagination to work through without a little guidance from reality.<br><br>But for that he needed a computer – actually needed to sit and look at a computer for at least a few minutes – and if that had been available from the start, then he wouldn’t have needed to run up all those shenanigans with Sofia. He settled into a rolling chair of his own, glared at the login window for a moment, and then began to rearrange papers in the stack more or less at random, just to seem as if he were doing something, while looking up and down the rest of the room. Perhaps a quarter of all the terminals in this space were occupied, most of them by students who looked quite engaged, whether watching videos as Sofia was, typing rapid-fire on the noisy keyboards, or copying text into their notebooks. Terrian rubbed his chin with the side of an index finger and sighed. Another limitation of which he was quite cognizant was the fact that there was no way in hell he was going to just walk up to one of them and politely ask if he might borrow their computer for a second. Quite apart from the implausibility of a self-styled professor being unable to log into one  of the many unclaimed computers on his own, Terrian had no idea what the flash drive would reveal. Compromising photographs which featured multiple varieties of farm animal, for all he knew. That would be a bit of a “toughie” to explain away with a bewildered late-teen whose first language was not English looking over his shoulder.<br><br>The snap of hardcover books suddenly shut reached his ears from the next table over. Two dark-haired youths were getting up from their stations. Terrian watched with only mild interest as a pair of identical popup windows materialized on their screens, yet noticed that while one of the boys promptly clicked a button in response, causing the popup window to vanish and the display to revert to the login screen, the other boy only zipped up a book into his backpack and paid the computer no heed as he followed his companion toward the door. <br><br>Terrian stared at the popup window, where a large bold two-digit number was ticking down. Then he got up and approached very hastily, dropping a couple of pages back onto the floor. The counter fell from <b>10</b> to <b>09</b> just as he reached the computer and read the text in the popup window:<br><br><div align="center"><font face="Helvetica"><font size="3"><i>Siete sicuro che volete uscire?</i></font></font></div><br>“<i>Per niente</i>,” Terrian muttered, and clicked the red X.<br><br>The popup window evaporated. The student’s desktop, however, remained. Terrian sat back in the chair for a moment to marvel at his own perceptiveness and quick thinking, then went back to gather up the fallen pages once again, hoping that Sofia was not going to look over and conclude that here was the least coordinated human being ever to attain a teaching position.<br><br>Fortunately the flash drive’s new contents were quite a bit less damning than he’d feared although in fairness it had to be said that snapshots of covert pony antics would have at least been more interesting.<br><br>Actually only one file appeared to have been added to the flash drive, a document blandly dubbed “results.txt”, which, when Terrian double-clicked it with trembling fingers and throbbing heart, opened to reveal:<br><br><hr><font face="Courier">Imelda D’Ortogna<br>St. 37<br>Ospedale Civile S.S. Giuseppe e Russo<br>Via Carrocci 482, 71076 Venezia, Italia<br>+39 041 265 8111</font><hr><br>Terrian stared at the file for a moment.<br><br>Then: “<i>Quello è tutto?</i>” he asked aloud in disbelief.<br><br>At first he highlighted the entire document to see if there was any further text that had been sneakily hidden in white, with disappointing results. Then he tried opening the file with a few different applications to see if its real content had been disguised by means of a <i>clever ruse</i>, but each app in turn either replicated the same text or told him to stop acting like a fool (Solitaire’s wording was particularly harsh). Finally he tried running Parmigianino.exe again, guessing quite reasonably that the routine might’ve been trying to accomplish more than he’d permitted, but all that happened the second time was that the program spat out an identical document called “results-1.txt” and promptly concluded.<br><br>Shaking his head, Terrian deleted the extra file (no need to arouse Blaise’s suspicions) and steered his attention toward the Internet. A quick Google search confirmed the existence and location of this hospital, but turned up no trace of an “Imelda D’Ortogna”. Terrian returned to the original text document and gazed at it for a few minutes, pinching his lip.<br><br>What had Blaise told him when she’d handed over the jump drive? She’d said it was the next step in looking for Flora Isobel. Well, all fine and dandy, but that wasn’t the name Parmigianino.exe had found. So who was D’Ortogna? A dying sage, her fruitful years well predating the Internet, who could take Blaise’s hands in her own crooked fingers and whisper Flora Isobel’s whereabouts in her ear? The wounded wife of a mafioso (there under an assumed name, of course) who was prepared to yield the exact location of the warehouse where a rival family had Isobel bound up and gagged? Or – that thought of an assumed name gave Terrian pause – couldn’t Imelda D’Ortogna and Flora Isobel even be the same woman? Blaise had known her birthdate down to the minute and the fucking <i>direction of the swirls on her fingerprints</i>. Or something about her fingerprints, anyway. If Flora Isobel was living life under the public eye at all right now and she <i>wasn’t</i> using a pseudonym, Terrian thought it hard to believe Blaise wouldn’t have found her long ago.<br><br><i>She wants to know where you are.</i><br><br><i>On my way back,</i> Terrian replied, without stirring, to the duplicate who was sitting with Blaise in the aquarium.<br><br>By and by he freed up his lip so as to send the text document to a nearby printer.<br><br>Then, for good measure, he copied the name and address and emailed them to himself before reviewing the screen, closing “results.txt”, pulling out the drive, and logging off. Once he’d retrieved the freshly-inked sheet, he left the teal computer lab behind and emerged again into the glossy hallway. As soon as he found another secluded corner, he immediately sent out another duplicate. He handed the document to this one, expecting him to turn smartly and stride down the hall toward the main gate, but the duplicate lingered without speaking. After a second it occurred to Terrian to pull out his wallet and give the duplicate appropriate taxi fare, at which point the duplicate turned smartly and strode down the hall toward the main gate.<br><br>But this didn’t account for all of the paper in Terrian’s hands just then. He was still holding the stack of pages filled with notes on marine geology. A nearby wastebasket caught his eye, but he stopped short with a grimace. These were half a semester’s worth of notes. Toss them out and he was just about guaranteeing failure for the hapless student he’d stolen them from, or at least quite a few tedious and unproductive hours spent copying out notes from his classmates’ books. That dreadful human emotion called a “conscience” overtook Terrian.<br><br><i>Can you see the kid I got the notes from?</i> he asked the duplicate in the aquarium, accompanying this with an image of the kid in question – merely as a refresher, since that duplicate had not yet branched off when Terrian’d stolen the notes, and so carried the memory himself.<br><br><i>Let me look.</i><br><br>Terrian made his way back, following the signs, to the aquarium, by which time came the answer: <i>He’s toward the back, but no dice: he’s not in the very back row and there are people all around him. Left of center as you come in.</i><br><br>Satisfied that his duplicate seemed to have independently guessed why he’d asked, Terrian went on: <i>And where are you guys?</i><br><br><i>Way down in front, on your right. There –</i> For Terrian had, as quietly as possible, slipped in through the giant glass doors. His duplicate was partway turned around in his front-row seat and waved modestly as Terrian came into view. Then the duplicate tapped Blaise on the arm, and she looked back over her shoulder at the newcomer, her thin eyebrows raised expectantly. Terrian grinned, lifted the flash drive between two fingers and sent the duplicate word that Parmigianino.exe was a success, which he could see him repeating to her in a hush. But it was to the duplicate, rather than the original, that Miss Euler inclined her head with a brief smile before returning her attention to Oceanara’s lecture.<br><br>“The ocean, quite simply, is the greatest mystery and greatest wonder that humanity has ever, and may ever, encounter…”<br><br>Terrian frowned and breathed a low tut. For reasons that were onerous to punctiliously diagnosticate at the contemporaneous juncture, he felt kinda miffed. He leaned up against the doors and contented himself with searching the closest rows to the back, left of center, for the pickpocketed student, whom he eventually recognized by his striped polo. The duplicate was right that Terrian didn’t have a clear shot at the kid, not with the other audience members surrounding him. He’d have to hang back until the end of the lecture and return the notes before rejoining this motley band.<br></div></div>

But they managed to narrow it down to Venice, of all things. And here's where it really gets interesting.
