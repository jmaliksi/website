        <div class="content"><div class="message">OOC: This topic references (eventually) a private RP with Stephanitis three years ago, and thus may refer to occurrences outside of the forums. Play along, it all should make sense. (As well as explain Nat's O-Sceard, which only has been mentioned in passing until now.)<br><br>BIC: Natalie stood still, searching the speckled, velvet skies with every sense available to her. Something in the air... It tasted foul, wrong. She had found purchase on the trunk of a large tree slightly to the north of Whelkshore, balancing perfectly at the base of its lowest limbs.<br><br>"So, you seem to be having quite the time up there, huh?" a thin, sickly individual asked from below. Their skin seemed almost white, as if the life in their body had ebbed away. He leaned back against the tree, breathing deeply.<br><br>"Who are you?" Natalie demanded of him, hand going to her sword. Though she didn't sense anything wrong with him at the moment, she had a bad vibe about something this evening. Trusting one's instincts was the key to living a long and mostly happy life.<br><br>"Just another stargazer as yourself." The weak youth paused. "My name is Garth Firbolg. I came south to get away from the city lights."<br><br>"Good luck with that here. The highway is only a half mile off," Natalie responded darkly. Her hand moved away from the coiled weapon, though Natalie remained vigilant.<br><br>"I make do with what I can," Garth responded, adjusting his jacket to keep the cold night air at bay. A brisk wind blew through the field they occupied, making Natalie slightly regret her choice of a T-shirt and jeans for the evening.<br><br>"Don't we all?" Natalie asked briefly, then paused. "Never mind. These days, we all live on borrowed time."<br><br>"Indeed. Though I'm sure that those who try can make time for the living."</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Half a mile off, on the highway, sat a small dark blue sedan, illuminated by a dusty streetlamp. It was Terrian Brogue's rental car. He'd flown in to spend a weekend in Whelkshore City, but just recently the car had screeched without warning to a halt on the road.<br><br>Right now two dashing, attractive, completely identical young men were standing around the car. One was peering under the hood, while the other was taking a couple of paper napkins to a nasty coffee spill that had occurred in the front seat when the car had shorted out.<br><br>"The engine looks fine," said the duplicate.<br><br>"Now," said the original Terrian, "do you genuinely know that the engine is fine, or are you just saying that because you don't see any open flames?"<br><br>"You tell me. Did you ever figure out how cars work?"<br><br>"Oh, I'm pretty sure dad taught me. I was maybe... sixteen?"<br><br>"And you've forgotten," his duplicate replied.<br><br>"Fair enough." Terrian took another napkin out of the compartment. "They're not going to be happy about this stain..." <br><br>"Well, maybe if they kept their rentals in better shape this kind of thing wouldn't happen."<br><br>"You think so?"<br><br>The duplicate pulled down the hood, frowning at him. "What?"<br><br>"Hmm? Oh." Terrian balled up his napkin and threw it off the road, into the field. Then he noticed that there weren't any grasshoppers chirping.<br><br>"Don't you just feel like there's something wrong?" he asked.<br><br>His duplicate stared at him.<br><br>"I think there's something wrong with the <i>car</i>," he said.<br><br>"That's not what I mean," said Terrian. He walked out into the road. "Why can't we hear any animals? And why haven't any cars passed by us since we broke down?"<br><br>"It's late," the duplicate offered.<br><br>"Not that late. This is a highway."<br><br>Down the road on either side there was nothing but street lights and concrete. And beyond that, nothing but fields and trees. And something...<br><br>"There's something weird about this place," Terrian declared.<br><br>"Okay. Call a tow truck. We'll get a lift to Whelkshore."<br><br>"Something I'm not liking at all."<br><br>"I'm not liking just sitting here either. Where's the phone?"<br><br>"You haven't noticed anything?"<br><br>The duplicate, who was rummaging in Terrian's briefcase for his cell phone, turned to look back at Terrian. "I've noticed that I'm really exhausted and want to check into a hotel as soon as I can. Maybe that's what you're feeling – fatigue – it messes with your head, you know."<br><br>Terrian didn't reply. Instead he walked off the road, past where the napkin had fallen. He went into the field. Whatever was going on here, he intended to figure it out.<br><br>Why wouldn't his duplicate feel just what he had felt? They had the same attunement, the same awareness. They always picked the same things up. Didn't they?<br><br>Soon he was in up to his waist among the crops.<br><br>* * *<br><br>His duplicate, after sending a few questioning thoughts to Terrian and finding no reply, tried the cell phone. It was out of service. Swell.<br><br><i>Might as well wait for him to give up, then.</i> As long as Terrian didn't call the duplicate to his side. The duplicate had no intention of trudging through wheat fields when he could be sleeping.<br><br>He leaned back in the front seat, rolled down his sleeve to glance at his watch, and remembered that he wasn't wearing one. It didn't cover enough surface area on Terrian's body to pick up any of the duplication's offshoot effects (the way his clothes did). The clock in the sedan was dark.<br><br>As he squinted, trying to read it, the streetlamp overhead the sedan flickered out.<br><br><br><i>OOC: Sorry if I made any unwarranted assumptions about the effects of this suspicious aura. I hope things like the car shorting out and the cell phone not working don't muddle with Lee's explanation of the strangeness in the air. Terrian, of course, will undoubtedly come across Natalie and Garth in a bit. I'd better not forget the duplicate's back in the car, though... seems like prime placement for something plot-wise to happen (or be about to happen) to him.</i> </div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">A small wyvern flew through the clouds above observing the ground below him.  <i>The air smells different here...</i>.  The winged serpent pulled upward into a half loop diving silently into the fields below.  <i>I smell familiar blood....hmmm... who could this be....</i>.  The wyvern started to undergo metamorphosis and the wings seemed to meld back into its skin and its body elongated.  The legs became shorter, and its tail long and whip-like, similar to that of an iguana.  The dragon's ears were protected by hardened bone which protruded like spikes out of the sides of its head, which also allowed him to hear in all directions a lot more accurately. <br><br>Turning its head, it noticed the voices of two men, but something was strange about them. They seemed to have the same voice, almost as if they were the same person.  The newly formed dragon ignored them as it seemed that its importance lied within the woman's voice that it heard.  <i>I'm not sure, but I am remembering this scent from somewhere...</i> the serpentine beast thought to itself.  It moved forward as stealthy as a snake, and waited, claws planted in the ground. It hid among the camouflage of the field, not moving, and watched as the woman was speaking with a frail human, intently absorbing the conversation. <br><br>The dragon's tongue flicked outwards, tasting the air, hoping to experience the mood set by the chemicals in the air.  Adrenaline rushed through the body of the reptile, and its muscles clenched, trying not to make a sound.  <i>Something is going to happen... I just don't know when</i>.  The dragon chuckled mentally. <i>Sounds like a horoscope, of course something will happen, and no one knows when... duh...</i>  </div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Indeed. Though I'm sure that those who try can make time for the living."<br><br>"You're correct there, my friend," a voice stated calmly from a limb above Nat.<br><br>There sat a tall man clad in a fine black suit with a very long jacket.  The very dim light from the area gleamed like the sun off of his three silver rings; one on each ring finger and on on his right index finger.  His silky black hair fell around his head to just about an inch below his earlobes.  A set of dull green eyes shone from under his hair like a set of pair of emeralds.  The man's head hung like he carried a heavy burden.  With a quick motion, the man spun around his limb and held seated upside-down on it, his hair touching the top of Nat's head.<br><br>"Long time no see Nat.  I didn't expect to find you out here but the pleasure is still the same," Valon Lorsha, King of the Dragons, said calmly as he tilted his head to look at the female warrior.<br><br>Valon sprung from his perch and landed flat-footed with his arms crossed about ten feet from the tree.  His eyes drifted up to the sky where he often found himself looking.  The stars held a comfort that was difficult to explain.  Valon always knew that he could watch the sky if something was bothering him and as such he did often.  This evening something seemed odd, some sort of foreboding wafting in the air.  <br><br>"I trust that you feel it as well, Nat.  There is something...odd...in the air tonight."</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Excuse me..." A young man, wearing a white dress shirt with elaborate embroidery, and pants of a similar shade, approached the rental car. Brushing a glowing powder from his sleeve, he looked over his shoulder. He toyed with his carefully coiffed dark hair, checking himself in the mirror.<br><br>"I was just wondering if you had seen anybody else of a similar attire to my own. We were heading to a... social function." The man licked his lips, and looked down the street.<br>--------<br>"Hey there, Valon," Natalie said distantly at first, though her voice warmed with every word, still leaning against the tree. She smirked slightly, thinking.<br><br>"And yeah, I can feel it in every cell of my body. It's like... I can't quite say. It's like that feeling where you've got static electricity on you... Only in reverse." Natalie mused, cracking her neck.<br><br>"The wimp down there is Garth Firbolg. And I can't see who else there is, but I can pick up a few other presences around here," Natalie said simply, jerking her thumb towards Garth, and then the field.<br><br>"I'm not necessarily a WIMP, per se..." Garth weakly protested, raising his hand as if to speak in class. With that, Natalie dropped from the tree, and landed beside Valon. She leaned nearer to him, and whispered in his ear.<br><br>"Fifty bucks says Mr. Asthma has some sort of superhuman powers," Natalie muttered confidentially. She then jerked around, turning to face a figure that had just appeared from thin air. Similarly decked in embroidered gear, though otherwise much fairer than his companion, he stepped up to Natalie and Valon. Garth tried to say something, but the words were stuck in his throat.<br><br>"Hello miss and sirs. We were taking up a collection, and I was wondering if..." He paused, and grabbed Natalie by the wrist. A moment later, with a twist of his free hand, a blade of crackling eldritch energy lanced out through her side. Natalie groaned, and collapsed to her knee.<br><br>"Thank you very much," the man said, then turned to walk away. "Garth, I'd advise you to stop running away from us. We'll just keep doing this, again and again."<br><br>"Regent!" Garth shouted weakly, his voice cracking.<br><br>"Some friend you've got there," Natalie muttered from where she had dropped. "Bastard got me with whatever that attack was, and stole my bracelet, all like that..." She remained kneeling, trying to sense the severity of her wounds.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Not a wise move there sir.  I'm not sure you understand who you are messing with.  The name is Valon Lorsha and..." Valon raised one hand to his face and created a white battle mask with black eyes, "I'm going to make you regret that."<br><br>In a graceful move Valon threw his hand out and summoned his sword, the Aruafon.  The blade seemed to have changed since the last time Valon had used it, but then again this was nothing new for true Aldra-Sa weapons.  The blade had grown out from two and a half feet to nearly four feet.  The blade had remained the same width and depth but had been lightened to a near white and now bore a long line of glowing green Draconic text.  The hilt of the Aruafon was now crafted from beautiful Emerald and Jade with the same white metal from the blade.  The pommel was shaped like a dragon claw clasping a crimson-colored stone that looked like an eye, the symbol of the Lorsha household.  Valon held the beautiful blade before his face and basked in the green glow of the blade.<br><br>"<i>Etma ul karuc Aldra-Sa, Etma ul karuc Dra.</i>  Challenge a mighty Aldra-Sa, Challenge a mighty God.  Beautiful isn't it?" Valon asked as he turned his blade on the newly arrived figure.<br><br>"Touch my friend again and I'll kill you where you stand!" Valon yelled as a mighty aura of green energy flashed around his body.<br><br>"Nat, are you all right?"</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">While the overdressed man's eyes were averted, the duplicate Brogue quickly took hold of the briefcase handle. That way, if Terrian called the duplicate back to him, they wouldn't leave the case behind. Brogue could bring something with him if he was holding it, and the briefcase was the most important of Terrian's baggage.<br><br>He did this while the man was looking down the street because he didn't want the man to think Brogue was afraid of getting robbed. Of course he <i>was</i> afraid of getting robbed but he was substantially more concerned that this man clad in white might turn out to be a vampire or some such.<br><br>"Uh, no, I haven't. I'm sorry. There hasn't been anyone passing by for a while, actually. We..." Brogue trailed off as the man turned his head to face him again.<br><br>Brogue quickly put together a thought and sent it to Terrian: <i>Terminally weird guy at four o'clock.</i><br><br>* * *<br><br>At the same moment that Terrian received this thought, he noticed something down the hill and across a field. It was a man in elaborate dress who'd been walking toward him, but was now turning back to look at something obscured by trees. <br><br><i>Really? I found someone, too. He looks like an escaped ballroom dancer.</i><br><br>There was a pause. Then:<br><br><i>So does this guy.</i><br><br><i>What's he doing? Do you need me to get you?</i><br><br><i>Maybe not right now. I'm going to wait and see if he starts howling at the moon first. But be ready, okay?</i><br><br>Before Terrian could compose his response, another figure emerged from beyond the trees. He also looked vaguely like an escaped ballroom dancer, although his suit was black and simpler than the first man's ornate white one. Really, the sword he was holding and the green light around his body also detracted from the ballroom dancer image an awful lot.<br><br><i>Um, things just got a little weirder. I'm ready. If your guy doesn't take off in about two minutes, I'd say you'd probably better get over here.</i><br><br>Terrian was momentarily unsure whether or not to approach the two strange men. Then he remembered that he was completely unarmed and this helped him conclude that he was not going to approach the two strange men. Not yet, anyway.<br><br>He knelt amid the tall grass, keeping his eyes on the two.<br><br>* * *<br><br>Brogue's man didn't seem to be leaving, or indeed to be talking or making any motion at all. Fidgeting, Brogue searched for a casual question.<br><br>"What kind of social function is it? I mean, if it's okay for me to ask that."</div></div>

It's the middle of the <i>fuckin'</i> night," said a groggy and mildly annoyed voice. "Couldn't you have come at daylight or something?"<br><br><i>Click.</i><br><br>It was apparent the voice came from some twenty-year-old guy with messy brown hair, made messier by the fact that he was tossing and turning in bed, unable to get any sleep due to the sticky feeling in the air. The man was dressed in a black overcoat which he hadn't bothered to button up over his pajamas. <br><br>The dramatic click came from the larger-than-normal revolver in the man's hand, which was pointed at Mr. Fancy-pants.<br><br>OOC: Well, this is a short post.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Dracon shot from the side of the field so fast that he looked nothing but a golden blur. He stood on his hind legs, bearing the claws on his front legs.  "Bad move indeed..." Dracon said with a slithery tongue, filled with a draconic echoing tone. Dracon's skin changed to a emerald color and long whiskers growing off of the nostrils of his nose.  Small wings protruded from its back, and the body began to elongate some more, and red fur developed at the end of his tail.  A mane of white hair exploded from Dracon's skull and red highlights formed in his mane.  Red decorative patterns began to glow on his skin, as he took an oriental dragon shape. <br><br>Dracon let out a loud roar and slammed his teeth together. It made a loud metal clang sound and sparks spewed around his teeth. "Move, and you're going to be in flames..." he said, his tone changing to a more deep and powerful voice. </div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"It's a charity gala honoring a special friend of ours who went above and beyond the call of duty. Simple as that." The dark haired man put a hand on the duplicate's shoulder. "You must be quite the coordinated individual. Such mental dexterity, carrying on two conversations at once... Makes me wonder what other things a multitasker like you is capable of..." He smiled, only showing his top teeth.<br><br>"Really, quite a few of my friends have gone missing. One moment you're with them, and the next, poof, they're gone. If only I could, say, instantly bring myself to where they were, you know?" The man squeezed his shoulder, slowly increasing the pressure until it began to hurt.<br>--------<br>"One bracelet, one person, and this whole ugly thing will be simply a dream, you know?" The blonde said, shrugging.<br><br>"Like hell it will be..." Natalie said, rising to her feet. "You barely missed my liver there. Barely."<br><br>"Don't think it was a miss. I just really didn't want to kill you," the man said, and turned to the others. "Really, attacking me, three on one? I'm no monster." He began slowly backing away, careful to make no sudden movements. A bead of sweat rolled down his forehead.<br><br>"I'd say that you are. And you of all people should not discount me." Garth responded, and slowly straightened his stance. He then raised his hand again, as high as he could extend it, and then brought it sweeping down. There was a momentary pause, and then a quiet rumbling was heard from the skies above. The man began moving backwards with a much greater expedience, his eyes turned skyward.<br><br>"Five. One little almost-vital wound, and you think I'm out?" Natalie grumbled, swinging her right foot as forcefully as she could muster at the back of the Regent's leg. Thrown off balance, he tumbled to the ground. Natalie winced as she stepped toward him again, dropping to her knees directly on top of his gut. The man gasped in pain, and was forcibly jerked into Natalie's fist by the collar of his shirt. He brought up his hand, the glowing blade now protruding from his bloody palm, only to have it batted aside by Natalie.<br><br>"Get off me you fool!" the man shouted, struggling to break free from her grasp.<br><br>"Why should I?" Natalie seized him by the throat.<br><br>"That's why," the man responded, pointing his blade skyward. About one hundred feet up, a billowing cloud of flames and lightning was descending extremely quickly, its rumble first growing to a roar, and then swelling to deafening waves of sound. From the looks of things, the blast would be about thirty feet across, and extremely unpleasant (unpleasant being another way of saying "singeing the flesh off of one's bones") for anything caught in it.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">First swordsmen and now stormchasers? Terrian watched whites and oranges flicker as the impending firestorm gathered over the heads of the ever-increasingly-large gaggle of combatants. It looked not nearly wide enough to pose a direct threat to him where he was crouching, but he couldn't help but feel that fire was not going to mix well with the wheat that enveloped him up to his chin.<br><br><i>Screw it, come over here. You've got the case, right? I want the gun.</i><br><br><i>No!</i><br><br>The duplicate's answer came back as a mental shout. This gave Terrian pause.<br><br>* * *<br><br><i>What do you mean? You were all set a second ago!</i><br><br><i>Yes, but—</i><br><br>"I don't know what you're talking about," said Brogue, perhaps a bit too slowly to be completely believable. "Multitasking" as the dark-haired man had put it was easy; there was far more strain involved in actually trying to speak one thing and think another in the same instant, rather than alternately.<br><br><i>Listen, the situation has changed in a couple of key ways. First off, this guy's on to us. He knows we've been having this conversation. He must be a telepath or something, I don't know, point is  he's nailed us. Okay?</i><br><br><i>What? Jesus—</i><br><br><i>Number two!</i><br><br>The dark-haired man was staring quite intently at Brogue. "No?"<br><br><i>Number two: he knows you can get me and he wants you to do so. Or maybe he doesn't, I don't know, either way he's gripping my shoulder so hard he might actually be about to tear me limb from limb. Can you</i> help?<br><br><i>Well? Do I get you or not?</i><br><br><i>I don't know!</i><br><br><i>What do you—</i><br><br>"Excuse me." The dark-haired man's nails were now starting to dig into his shoulder. "I'd prefer your undivided attention, if you don't mind."<br><br>Terrian's thoughts came through one more time into Brogue's head: this time only seven words. Terrian was, so to speak, thinking in shorthand.<br><br><i>he reads? then tell truth. how hide?</i><br><br>Brogue sighed, then repeated himself. "I don't know what you're talking about. Are you confused? What makes you think I'm the one with the teleportation power? I'm just a duplicate."<br><br>This did not lessen the dark-haired man's grip at all, so Brogue went on.<br><br>"The original can summon me to his side if he wants. But that's at his discretion, not mine. I have zero say in the matter. So whatever you're trying to scare out of me, if it hinges on my taking you to where the original is, you're out of luck."<br><br>* * *<br><br>Terrian swatted a fly from his face. This wasn't his evening.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Emily had been driving to a charity bake sale when her car had stalled out on the highway. She sighed and punched the steering wheel, then sighed and got out. From the looks of it the car was not going to start. She got in and tried the car again. She sighed again. Any baker would make sure their pastries made it to its destination; any good baker would be punctual as well. She grumbled a few words that borderline swore as she opened the back. She grabbed two large bracelets that contained her spikes, and a 2” by 2” box. The box contained a cake that looked like a picture book, but had the characters walking out of it.<br> <br>She started down the road and hadn’t gotten to far when she saw fire in the sky. A year ago she would have run as far from it as possible, but now she raced towards it. Emily raced through a field full of some kind of plant. At the edge of it she set down her cake and strapped on her bracelets, then stepped into the place everyone was gathered. <br><br>“Natalie!” Emily shrieked. “How are you? I haven’t seen you in forever!” Emily said, overjoyed at seeing her old friend. Only after that did she notice Natalie had a man by the throat. She paused for a moment then continued, “Umm, so I was wondering, why do you have a big fire thingy in the sky?”<br></div></div>

As bravely as a sniper can be said to do such things."<br><br>The duplicate was obviously trying to sort out the fight. Terrian could have simply re-absorbed him and shared all that they had witnessed, but that could wait; he was preferring the company at the moment. He checked again to make sure the Masher was loaded and then aimed it at the fighters.<br><br>"Wait. Who are you going after?"<br><br>"The dressed-up guy.

If he and my guy really are in cahoots, then don't you think we ought to make that call before shooting at him?"<br><br>"Do you honestly want—" Terrian began, but stopped short as he watched the only woman across the field deliver a kick that knocked the formally dressed man cold. He fell to the ground.<br><br>"Shoot <i>her</i> if anything, she might end up a business rival," said Brogue.<br><br>"What – I—" Terrian blustered. "<i>You</i> were the one being molested by tuxedo boy number two a minute ago!

Shoot at her if you're going to shoot at anyone."<br><br>He looked back across the field, and Terrian followed his gaze. A feeble-looking man whom Terrian had scarcely been following in the skirmish was now backing against a tree, watching fearfully as the woman approached with a long blade in her hand that certainly had not been there a moment ago.<br><br>"Yeah, see? She's probably about to cut that guy open. And he looks totally defenseless. Are you going to sit and let that happen?"<br><br>"God! All right!" Terrian yelled. He took a deep breath. "I'm only doing this because I have watched this fight for too long without firing a bullet and now I hunger to get the lead out. Whatever the consequences of this action, I pass them along unto you."<br><br>He then fired a shot from the Mage Masher at the woman with the blade.<br><br><br><i>OOC - I'M SORRY. Terrian knows not what he does. Every single thing that has happened in this topic has only served to make him and his duplicate more confused, not less.<br><br>Although the Mage Masher's bullets can pass through any form of magical intervention, as you may recall from Chords, Terrian is standing way the hell across a field from Natalie and he is not a dead shot at this kind of distance.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"No pills, please. I'll heal this up quickly enough." Natalie responded, waving Emily away. Gone from sight one moment, a rustle in the grass indicated her return beside Terrian, though still obscured by the greenery.<br><br>"That's right. I won't punch him." Natalie jerked, her blade lancing out and slicing into the back of Terrian's calf with a sickening ripping noise. She flickered, the blade disappearing, leaving Terrian with a slowly spreading dark stain on his leg. "That was only a shallow one, since I'm guessing you can't heal. Hit nothing vital, and it should be patched up in a few days. But it hurts like hell, doesn't it?" She turned away from him for a moment.<br><br>"I say we take the twins, wimpy, and the guy with the energy knife to a place where we can talk things over. I know a good warehouse about a mile off that won't have anybody in it this time of night..." Natalie raised a finger, stopping Ender. "No teleporting. We walk." She gave Terrian a pat on the cheek, and then began striding along.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Beelzebibble</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Still hovering in midair, Terrian buckled over. He could tell the wound wasn't severe, but it felt about six times more painful than it should be. He gingerly attempted to soothe the wound with his hands, wishing that the cold numbness that was just starting to creep in around the edges of the white-hot pain would hurry up and overtake it.<br><br>Tears welled up in his eyes, through which he could see – what? The duplicate Brogue, still carrying the briefcase, had rushed forward and crossed around in front of the woman's path.<br><br>Terrian shut his eyes, but could clearly hear Brogue say, "I deserved that."<br><br>Terrian didn't hear any response from the woman, but Brogue went on: "No – wait – listen. I talked him into firing at you. He was going to shoot at the dressed-up guy, but... Well, there's the thing he said, about how we thought you were going to attack <i>him</i>—" (Terrian assumed Brogue was gesturing toward the feeble man) "—but there's also this."<br><br>Terrian, still squeezing his eyes shut, heard the briefcase open. Brogue, he guessed, was showing the woman the business card.<br><br>"We can talk about this when we get to the warehouse. It's all very weird and confusing. But the point is, I'm the reason why he shot at you. And the only reason I'm not offering up <i>my</i> leg for you to stab is because I can't feel pain. That would only make him suffer a little more."<br><br>Terrian opened his eyes and looked back at Brogue and the woman in time to see his duplicate add: "So for future reference, can you be pissed at me instead?"</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Well, well, well... A perfectly good example wasted. Beyond making somewhat more clear to him what a bad idea it is to shoot me without killing me, no good whatsoever. I was hoping you two would share the pain, but I guess that was far too much to ask." Natalie stopped, thinking to herself.<br><br>"I guess that we probably should teleport then, if it's not going to punish the one at fault any. Besides, it's faster. And I really want to know what all of the pretty boys around here happen to be up to," Natalie continued, neglecting to apologize. If she couldn't get Brogue back, that would have to do for now. She knelt down to examine her injured leg. The rapid transformations had healed it significantly, and she had omitted the bullet from her body with the first teleport. It still hurt to walk on, but that was what happened. She could heal severe damage due to the modifications to her sceard Sly had made, but minor wounds and fatigue still wouldn't depart. This would be with her until she healed on her own.<br><br>"And now that I think about it, Emily, I think that Ender probably could use those painkillers better than I could," Natalie stated just loudly enough for her friend to hear, and gesturing toward the psionic.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Right. Painkillers. Just have it ready. Off we go!" Ender flashed a smile and the entire group disappeared.<br><br>They reappeared outside the warehouse that Nat had described. As soon as they appeared, Ender briefly blacked out and lost his footing. He regained consciousness as he was falling, and managed to only fall to one knee. His hands shot up to the sides of his head. Around his temples the major veins bulged out. There was almost visible pumping.<br><br>Weakly, the psionic reached a trembling hand to his pocket and pulled out his bottle of extra strength aspirin. He simply tipped it into his mouth, a good number of pills spilling off to the side, and swallowed it all down. Then he just flopped onto the floor on his back to breathe for a bit.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message"> After being teleported Emily saw Ender collapse. She gasped. “Nat, what’s wrong with him?” After another moment she noticed he used extra-strength aspirin. She gasped even louder. “Oh my goodness!” she yelled, “Why are you taking those? How could you be so evil?” She expected Natalie to side with her and was little shocked when Nat gave her a questioning look.<br><br>Emily sighed with exasperation “Do you ever read anything that has to do with modern medicine!” It wasn’t really a question. “I got it from a very reliable source that aspirin is evil. Not only does it kill your kidneys and liver and brain, but also the companies force abandoned orphans to make it! Worse yet, they test on animals!” She could barely believe how ignorant some people could be.<br><br>“Reliable source eh?” Natalie said sarcastically. “When did the tabloids become reliable?”<br><br>Emily gasped again. “How did you know that was where I read it?”<br></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Five-second rule," said Brogue, as he delicately plucked a couple of pills off the floor and gave them to Terrian, who was sitting on the floor with a grimace and nursing his wound. With a smile of thanks for his duplicate and not a word of acknowledgement to Emily, Terrian popped the aspirin. For all the good <i>that</i> did. Then he sat back.<br><br>"Give me your socks, too," he said to Brogue.<br><br>He answered the duplicate's blank stare by explaining things with thought instead of speech. <i>I'm going to make a bandage. Give me your socks and then I'll re-absorb you.</i><br><br><i>What? Really? But...</i><br><br><i>Yeah?</i><br><br><i>Can't I stay out a little longer? I still feel responsible for all this.</i><br><br>Terrian considered this, surprised. The duplicate was developing his own conscience, independent of Terrian's. That wasn't the only way one of them could attain proper sense of self, but it was certainly one route. Well, why not. He'd always meant to getting around to creating a few more of those.<br><br>"Fair enough," he said aloud. "But if we survive this, you're going to medical school."<br><br>He reached out a hand, and Brogue took it to help him up; he then tottered forward a few steps, and turned to see that standing behind him was a third Terrian Brogue whose leg was identically wounded. Almost disturbingly, however, this duplicate paid no heed to the injury, since he couldn't feel pain. Without a word, he knelt down, removed his shoes, removed his socks, replaced his shoes, handed his socks to Terrian, and then limped back to him.<br><br>Again they were two. Terrian sat back down and tied the socks as tightly as he could bear around the gash on his right leg. Brogue, looking around uncomfortably at the room and the others, heard him mutter, "No wonder Tuxedo Boy was so interested in me. Who wouldn't be? Terrian Brogue, the infinite sock generator."</div></div>

She wanted to say 'wimps', but that would be levelling an accusation at Ender, who was in pain just because he wanted to help her. "-are patched up to the point where we won't die, let's talk turkey." She turned to point out the two prone forms besides Ender's, Garth and the man who had stabbed her.<br><br>"Something's up," she growled, striding toward them. She took care to avoid Ender, but rather deliberately stepped on her former foe as she passed over him. She approached Garth, who was still snared too tightly in vines to move, and brought her right hand up. Her sword appeared, locked into a straight position, and at his quivering throat.<br><br>"Don't kill him!" Emily shouted, and Natalie simply nodded, showing she heard.<br><br>"You know what's going on. You said so yourself. Now..." She pushed it closer, the very tip of the blade piercing skin. Garth snapped his head back, his breathing wracking his frame. His eyes were wild with terror, and foam flecked his lips.<br><br>"TALK!" Natalie began to advance toward him, only to be stopped short. Sly, who had transformed from his fly form into his human guise, put one delicate hand on Natalie's tensed shoulder.<br><br><i>&lt;We Andalites may not be above doing what's necessary to do the job...&gt;</i> Sly pushed back against her slightly. <i>&lt;But I think you're just terrorizing the poor boy.&gt;</i> Nat turned to meet his glance, Sly's eyes showing both concern and disappointment. She flickered, her weapon disappearing, and turned away from Garth. She gave the other man a kick in his satin-clad ribs as she walked back to the main group.<br><br><i>&lt;Now then...&gt;</i> Sly reach behind him, his hand moving more quickly than the average eye could track. Beams of light sliced across the obstructions, and then the roots burst from around Garth in a shower of soggy splinters. Sly holstered his shredder again, the weapon having already cooled. He then knelt down, offering a hand to the youth. <br><br>"Wh-What ARE you?" Garth choked, drawing back in obvious fear. Perhaps he could sense that the being extending a hand to him was neither human nor fly.<br><br><i>&lt;I'm a friend of the people who were hurt in this incident. That's all that matters. Now stand up. Let us talk with you.&gt;</i> Sly responded, as if talking to a scared child. Garth wordlessly responded, shakily rolling to his feet and taking the shapeshifter's hand gently as he stood up.<br><br>"Are you going to hurt me?" Garth asked, still watching Natalie even though she had turned away from him and was examining the nearest wall.<br><br>"I can't speak for the rest of them. But I know that I won't," Sly said, keeping his voice reassuring and strong. "It'd probably help if you were to tell us what was going on."<br><br>"Can they hear what you're saying?" Garth asked, glancing to Sly.<br><br>"Yes. We can," Natalie replied, turning back to face him out of the corner of her eye. "Go on."<br><br>"Okay!" Garth stepped back a little, Sly stepping to stay beside him.<br><br>"Anyways... This all started a while ago, when I was younger... Maybe four years ago or so? Longer? I don't really remember. Anyways, when I wasn't even a teenager, I awoke one morning to find my window smashed and a bronze circle with a symbol on it on my floor." He paused, and took a deep breath.<br><br>"So, I was kinda surprised, but I just kept it as a good luck charm. That seemed not to lead to any problems, you know, a harmless trinket kind of thing, right?" Garth smiled, wiping some of the spittle from earlier from his lips. "So, anyways, one day, I wake up, and when I went to go look for it, it had disappeared."<br><br>"I looked around for a little while, worried about losing my mojo, but I gave up on it and decided to shower before school..." His hand went to the buttons towards the waist of his shirt, and began unfastening them awkwardly. "So, I go to get undressed, and I have... THIS." He jerked the light fabric of his shirt aside, revealing his stomach. Emblazoned on it was a massive, angry-looking mark. The same red as a back lashed in torture, a straight line drew itself from his ribs to his navel, with a similar line curving around it twice.<br><br>"That was three days ago. When I went to see a doctor about it, they said it looked like an allergic rash of some kind, and that they'd need to hold onto me until they found out what caused it... The second night I was there, a male nurse came and put me under..." Garth smiled ruefully.<br><br>"I awoke later on, in Violet, dressed like this and tied down to a table like some sort of sacrificial animal. There were a lot of people wearing this kind of clothing, and they were chanting in some kind of ritual. I freaked out, and that meteor thing from earlier came down." Garth gave an apologetic look to Natalie, who simply turned away from him.<br><br>"I escaped in the chaos, and have been on the run since then." Garth concluded.<br><br>"Wait... So you escaped?" Natalie asked, her voice incredulous.<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"Then why did you hang around here, IN THE OPEN, and let whatever these cultist guys are find you?"<br><br>"I thought that since they had taken me captive when I was alone and hidden, maybe they'd stay away if I found some people..." Garth looked rather ashamed at his logic. "You were the first person I saw, since that weird stuff in the air was keeping most people away."<br><br>"Seems reasonable," Sly announced to the group, stepping away from Garth. "So, you're with us, right?"<br><br>"You're just going to accept him?" Natalie growled, turning to face Sly directly.<br><br>"If we do hurt him, we might be doing the work of those other guys for them. And considering their track record-"<br><br>"I'm in." Garth said, cutting Sly off. "If you don't mind."<br><br><i>&lt;You were pretty good with him, Sly.&gt;</i> Ender privately intoned.<br><br><i>&lt;It's natural. He reminds me of Rick when he was younger.&gt;</i> Sly responded. <i>&lt;And if there's one thing you never forget, it's how to be a father.&gt;</i></div></div>

        <h2 class="poster">Beelzebibble</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">In the silence that followed, Terrian said very clearly, "I'm not taking vengeance on anyone."<br><br>He didn't seem interested in arguing the point further with the draconic humanoid who had been watching these proceedings without a word until now. Indeed Terrian didn't seem curious that the creature was even there. Brogue, concerned, tried to catch Terrian's eye. He knew the only thing that could put a stopper on Terrian Brogue's natural curiousity was the desire not to open up. And the duplicate, watching the original sit on the floor and tend to his wound, thought he had never seen himself look less willing to open up.<br><br>Brogue, therefore, decided to take the initiative. "Maybe now is a good time to talk about this," he said, bringing back out the business card he had shown to Natalie outside. He gave it to her. As she studied it with grudging interest, and as others in the room pressed in to take a look, Brogue explained.<br><br>"I told you this was part of the reason why I wanted my original to shoot at you. What I haven't told you is who gave it to me. There was another tuxedo boy like this guy. He..." Brogue swallowed, realizing he would have to start earlier. He looked to Terrian for encouragement, but the original was staring at his leg and hadn't deigned to look up for any of this.<br><br>"The car broke down," said Brogue. "All the streetlamps went out – our phone wasn't working – might be now, I'm not sure – anyway, Terrian told you all that. Then he told you we both came out here to investigate. That wasn't totally true. <i>He</i> came out here to investigate. I stayed behind in the car. And another tuxedo boy like this one came over to see me.<br><br>"All the while Terrian was watching your fight, this other guy was talking to me – saying – really weird things, I couldn't figure most of it out. He was trying to intimidate me, but I didn't understand what he wanted. Eventually he gave me this card. He said he and his group thought they could use Terrian's talent. He said they'd seen what Terrian had done at the Parmigianino Institute... that was a while ago, we helped – I guess Rie might have told you about it," he finished rather lamely, looking at Ender.<br><br>Brogue turned helplessly back to his original, but Terrian had now apparently found a very interesting spot on the far wall, because it was holding his undivided attention.<br><br>"So – I don't know – now that we might be getting service again, I think Terrian and I wanted to try calling the number. Figure out where they are, what they're up to, why they're interested in us... That's all stuff you guys might find it helpful to know, isn't it?"<br><br><i>OOC - I love how thoroughly Terrian's and his duplicate's attitudes have shifted since my first post in this topic.</i></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Prime was going far too fast for his own good when he drove into the dark area, the electronics in his <i>electric</i> motorcycle going dead. "Oh hell," Prime said, tapping the screen frantically as the motors started to cease up. He desperately squeezed the breaks, but they were power driven as well. He hit a rock, wobbled, and his back wheel started spinning a lot slower than the front. The power imbalance dragged him into the side of a warehouse building, where a loud crash saw him embalmed in the huge metal wall.<br><br>"Euuugh," he groaned, trying to move. His shoulder and waist were surrounded by metal. His bike trapped his leg against the steel wall. He could feel bruising starting to creep up his leg, and over his waist and ribcage. "Oh hell." He pulled at his leg experimentally, but winced, and started gasping. "Okay, that's not gonna work. HELP!" Prime screamed, hoping somebody nearby had a crowbar.<br><br>OOC: Remember, amnesia! He's a deja vu person! And yes, that is your warehouse.</div></div>

The large shapeshifter jogged over to the biker, his leg lodged in his bike.  He placed both hands on his hips. "Well this isn't good, now is it? Let me help you." <br><br>Dracon's appearance changed again: this time he was a green scaly color, with big beefy dragon arms, and a face similar to that of a iguana, his tail taking up about 75% of his body length.  His tongue flicked the air lightly as he wrapped his fingers around the metal, bending it outward, letting the man free up his leg. <br><br>"And who might you be?"

"Anyways, thanks for getting me out of there, dragon man," he said, brushing himself off, and popping his bike seat. He pulled out a semi-automatic pistol he'd picked up earlier, and checked for damage. "Well at least this thing is all right," he muttered, then turned back to his rescuer. "I'm Pardas Rafe Idris Magnus Elder, also called Prime due to my initials," he said, inclining his head slightly.<br><br>He then noticed a few other characters, colorful characters, not far off. "Oh, what's going on? We seem to have prisoners here," he said thoughtfully, shifting his stance. "Well, I'd be willing to help out a bit if there's a job opportunity here, or if anyone has some extra-strength pain killers.

Those schmucks must really want to meet you on their terms, not ours..." She paused, her sword clinking slightly. "So they wanted Garth and you. And he said something about me-"<br><br>Looking at the floor for a moment, mulling over her options, Prime's bike crashed into the building. Almost instantly, Nat threw herself at Garth, tackling him to the ground and covering him as best she could. She flickered, reappearing facing the wreckage where the wall had once been.<br><br>"Huh... Just a... Yeah." She shrugged, flipping the card back to Terrian, aiming for the bridge of his nose. "Just another person getting caught up in this crap because magicians can't keep their ****ing **** to their dumb*** selves." As Prime approached the group, a vague look crossed Natalie's face.<br><br>"Oh. YOU," she muttered, the corner of her mouth turning down.<br><br>"You know him? So you guys are friends too!" Emily ventured.<br><br>"No. We aren't. He just looked like... somebody I knew, I think." Natalie sighed, and kicked at the floor. "Anyways, I'm not going to let some sap crashing into a wall distract me."<br><br>"I say that we've got two tools here. We've got one of them captive, and we've got a number to reach their superiors." She paused, turning around and taking Garth by the collar. "Four tools. Two captives they want. Five if you count my bracelet. We've got some serious leverage with whatever we do."<br><br>"I'm thinking that we should bargain their own man against the information on why they want us, and-" She snapped her fingers.

        <div class="content"><div class="message"><i>OOC: Jointly written conversation. Lee wrote the NPC's dialogue.</i><br><br>The business card bounced neatly off Terrian's nose and twirled to the floor, where he picked it up. He gestured toward the duplicate Brogue, who was still holding the briefcase uncertainly. Brogue handed it over, and Terrian opened it up. Almost immediately, he closed it again. The Mage Masher was back inside, and he thought it better no one in the room should see he was still armed.<br><br>Terrian had dropped the gun when Natalie had cut his leg open; Brogue must have picked it up and stashed it without anyone noticing. Terrian mentally lauded the duplicate's acumen as he opened the suitcase again, only by a few inches this time. He fished out what he had originally been looking for – the cell phone – and flipped it open. A couple of bars. Good enough.<br><br>"Great," he muttered, punching in digits, as Natalie's speech ran to its end. "Sure. All right. Fine. Also: think fast."<br><br>Brogue, who had apparently gotten stuck trying to puzzle out Natalie's sums of tools, immediately snapped to attention. "Hold on—!"<br><br>But already a voice on the other end said, "Ah. It's you."<br><br>Terrian supposed this might be the second tuxedo boy, the one who had left the card with Brogue, but without any way to know for sure he said simply, "That's right."<br><br>"Quite punctual, really. Typically, referrals such as you take a little bit more time to come up with a response. I'll need to hand this news along to my higher ups," the voice oozed like a poisonous honey. "Of course, you don't really need to be <i>too</i> punctual when working with us, I suppose. Otherwise, the three other members that were supposed to back us up would have been able to keep things from blowing up so spectacularly."<br><br>It didn't seem like the proper night for Terrian to deliberately complicate matters, and so he looked for the best way to steer around this last cryptic sentence and turn the conversation back to its goal. With a glance at Natalie, he said into the phone, "My response is yes: I'm interested in your offer."<br><br>"Of course, of course," the man responded, a small glimmer of happiness appearing in the mire of his voice. "It's not as if we would pick somebody unlikely to work with us. Such behavior would only be poor business, after all." After a pause, his tone grew more eager. "So, when will you be able to come in for the interview?"<br><br>Terrian looked at his wristwatch. Eleven thirty. "Well... it's a little late, but I happen to be unoccupied. If there's always someone at your... office, I could drop by tonight. How close are you to Whelkshore?"<br><br>"There is always someone at our... office. It's policy." The man changed to a more guarded tone in mid-word. "As for proximity, well, don't think that you could just Mapquest us. We use the absolute latest and best when it comes to security. To get here? Step through the card."<br><br><i>What did he say?</i> Brogue thought to Terrian; the duplicate had been listening in on the cell phone conversation to the best of his ability.<br><br>"Step through the – I don't suppose I can trouble you for any advice on how to step through the card?" Terrian asked the man. "Or is that something I'll figure out?"<br><br>"It's quite simple, really. You set it down on the floor, and then step on it like you're going down stairs. I'd think that with your experience, such things would be mundane by now."<br><br>Terrian could have corrected the man's overestimation of his experience, but decided it would be better simply to say "All right. I'll be there in a moment. Anything else I should know before showing up?"<br><br>"Well, we're a very growth-oriented organization. If you were to happen to, say, catch a couple passersby and bring them along, that would be lovely. And if you haven't killed my dear friend yet, he would be a most delightful present to take with you."<br><br>"Of course," was the brightest reply Terrian could come up with under time pressure. Hoping he had made it sound mysterious and impressive enough, he hung up. Then he set the card down on the floor in front of him and, with help from the duplicate Brogue, got to his feet.<br><br>"Clear the way, now, people, give a guy his space, I've got some walking to do – oh, <i>shit</i>," he gasped, quickly shifting weight off his injured leg. Brogue stepped forward to support him better.<br><br><i>What's the plan?</i> he thought to Terrian.<br><br>"Not much use trying to conceal it from this bunch, is there?" Terrian replied aloud. "I'm going to go have a word with the bridegroom brigade."<br></div></div>

His face was stone but his dull green eyes shone like emerald fire in the dimly lit room.  Valon nearly floated over to Terrian and grabbed his shoulder before he could descend into the portal and caught his gaze.  A few long moments passed, Valon let the man go and smiled softly.<br><br>"I'm going with you.  Who knows what we're walking into and I'm more than capable to keep things from going overboard.  I think that you need to explain exactly how we're going to be paying these people a visit for those of us that don't have super hearing." Valon winked, giving off the impression that he had been listening to the entire conversation.<br><br>OOC- Short, but not alot to go with.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Sly tilted his head as he listened to both ends of Terrian’s conversation, making sure to keep his main eyes focused on both him and his copy. One stalk-eye was rapidly moving between everyone and keeping as many people in his field of vision while the other focused on supervising Nat and her ‘captive’. <br><br>&lt;<i>Interesting,</i>&gt; Sly said, glancing at the card that would take them exactly where they wanted to go. &lt;<i>I will also accompany you.</i>&gt;<br><br>OOC – Horrible, but I am sleepy.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Wait just a minute, all of you." Natalie walked up to Terrian, having been too far away to pick up both ends of the conversation with her fairly mundane hearing.<br><br>"You all might be full of bravado and all that, but I've dealt with people like this. They don't just go 'Oh, you're cool, let's hire you.' They want insurance. If they didn't want something from you, they wouldn't let you know that they're interested." Nat stepped in closely, leaning into Terrian's face.<br><br>"So, what is it that they wanted, huh? We're not going to find out they demanded a sacrifice of one of us or something, right?" She leaned in closer, her breath in his face. Her eyes were full of emotion, though the shade made it hard to tell the details. Was it anticipation? Rage? Impatience? Fright? Nobody could be quite certain what it was that the girl was exuding. Her hands weren't on her sword, at least. For Terrian, that was a start.</div></div>

I mean, you can offer minimum wage, but..."<br><br>Terrian turned his head away from hers a bit to address the others. "On the other hand, I probably ought to answer your question for the benefit of anyone in the room whose resume doesn't include beating up on tuxedo boys and slicing open the legs of potential tuxedo boys of the future. I don't know what they want from me especially. Your guy didn't...?" he said to Brogue.<br><br>"No," said the duplicate hesitantly, whose nervous attitude had only grown more and more pronounced as Natalie had closed with Terrian. "My guy just said they could use talent like mine."<br><br>"And the one on the phone didn't even say that," Terrian went on. "Whereas he <i>did</i> say that I was welcome to bring along other people to the interview. So whatever they want from me, it's not so special that they're not going to consider hiring others."<br><br>Terrian looked back at Natalie. "Basically, the plan is me going to see them. If the relatively harmless among us want to come along, that's no problem. But they definitely wouldn't be happy to see <i>you</i> sitting in on the interview so please have no fear. No one's going to sacrifice you. You're not coming."<br><br>"Um," said Brogue loudly, primarily to shut Terrian up. "I feel like you and I have been getting slaughtered by telepaths tonight. Aren't you worried there are going to be more mind readers at the... office? They'll know you've been conspiring with enemies of the organization."<br><br>"I haven't been conspiring with anyone," Terrian replied immediately, before he was even sure whether or not his response was true. But of course it didn't matter – the duplicate was right anyway – the tuxedo boys would figure out he'd spoken with Nat, Valon, Ender and the dragon man. Terrian thought about this for a moment.<br><br>"Can anyone here protect against telepathy?" he asked, again looking away from Natalie and hoping she wasn't going to raise her hand.<br><br><br><i>OOC - Choobs, Bulbs, this one's for you mostly.

Nat looked him over for a moment before looking to the fallen member of the enemy's number.<br><br>"That guy there... Terrian, right?" Garth got a noncommittal nod from Brogue.

Not much choice, huh? Stay back here with Valon. He's the strongest here, and can keep you safe the best."<br><br>"Uhhh..." Garth rubbed at his lip for a moment. "To be honest with you, I really need to talk with them. They're probably the only people that know what's happening to me right now.

Gee, maybe you aren't quite the wimp I had pegged you as. Still a wimp, but not as bad as I thought." Natalie knelt down and scooped up the man who had stabbed her earlier, lifting him with one hand.<br><br>"Emily? You get Sleepy, here. The boys are all too beat up to handle him, so it's all up to you." Natalie spun, and used the momentum to toss the unconscious figure. Emily caught him, surprised, but still with minimal effort on her part.<br><br>"What?"<br><br>"They'll want their home boy back. Be sure to smack his head on the doorframe on the way in for me."<br><br>OOC: Just taking care of the last of the setup.

Valon, Ender, and Brogue hang back (sorry guys, but I don't think they'd take too kindly to Valon showing among the kids after his display earlier... Don't worry.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"There's no need," said the duplicate Brogue to Emily, who was half-carrying, half-dragging the unconscious tuxedo boy's form. "I can take him."<br><br>"What are you talking about?" asked Terrian. "You're staying here."<br><br>"Maybe I shouldn't." Brogue's face was set; he had obviously been preparing this for the last few minutes. "Maybe you should instead."<br><br>"What?"<br><br>"Look at your leg! You don't think they're going to notice? What are you going to tell them, you fell down some stairs? Listen, I should go, this whole thing is my fault. Let me take care of it—"<br><br>"No," said Terrian. "I fired the gun. The responsibility's mine."<br><br>"But your leg..."<br><br>"If they ask about the wound, I'll tell the truth." In answer to Brogue's uncomprehending stare, Terrian added, "Which is that it's none of their business."<br><br>Before the duplicate could protest, Terrian went on. "I really appreciate what you're saying. But I don't want you feeling like you have to atone for anything. You got confused, that's all. Can I blame you?"<br><br>Brogue opened his mouth, closed it, and then looked away. "Not really."<br><br>Terrian smiled and laid a hand on the duplicate's shoulder. "So you're good. Stay here and pay attention. I'll tell you when I need you."<br><br>Brogue didn't look back at Terrian, but he smiled a little even so. "You're the boss."<br><br>Terrian moved away from his duplicate and looked the room over. Some crowd. There was Valon Lorsha, puffing himself up and looking important. He'd been keeping an eye on Terrian since they'd teleported; the blowhard clearly thought he needed to be an Intimidating Presence. Standing near him was the hotshot biker with the pretentious long name who expected everyone to call him "Prime". Nice pair, the two of them.<br><br>On the floor was Ender. Ender... Terrian had thought of him as a friend after that airship cruise, but Ender had done about the most half-hearted job imaginable of vouching for him. Terrian supposed he was foolish to think that the psionic was liable to give a damn what happened to him... and the girl, Emily. Gushing over Ender's headache and not even looking at the guy with a sword gash clear through his leg.<br><br>Flitting around almost imperceptibly in the air was the minuscule form of the dragon man. Not the brains of this outfit, Terrian guessed. Not after that comment about taking vengeance on the tuxedo boys or sticking around with thumbs up asses. Did this creature have the <i>least</i> idea of the complexities of the situation, or was he just hoping no one would notice?<br><br>And Natalie... He didn't even want to think about Natalie.<br><br>To be fair, though, Sly was a good man. And even though Terrian would have been in his hotel in Whelkshore by now if not for Garth, the kid seemed okay all the same. And, of course, his duplicate. <i>Don't forget tuxedo boy number one,</i> he thought, and he wasn't disturbed by that thought, because honestly what did Terrian have against tuxedo boy number one?<br><br>But these few seconds' musings were holding up the action. Terrian took one of Sly's metallic pellets out of Natalie's hand and plugged it into his ear. Then he looked at Sly. "Is it working?"<br><br>Sly stared at Terrian a moment, evidently trying to probe his mind, then nodded.<br><br>"Good," said Terrian. He sent a thought to Brogue. <i>But you can still hear me, right?</i><br><br><i>Yeah, I can. Do you get me?</i><br><br><i>Yeah.</i><br><br>Brogue frowned. <i>How is that?</i><br><br><i>Well, we're not reading each others' minds, are we? It's more like sending email, what we do. Fine. I was hoping this would work out.</i> "In that case," Terrian spoke aloud, "I'll be off."<br><br>He thought about offering the tiny dragon a place on his collar or somewhere, then thought better of it; he'd rather not play host to someone whose name he didn't even know.<br><br>Instead, he simply walked over to the card, which still lay innocently on the floor. Feeling more than a little stupid, he stepped forward with his left foot onto the card.<br><br>His foot touched the card. And kept going. And hit solid wood.<br><br>He was standing somewhere else.<br><br>He was on a vast wooden deck on the edge of a cliff, overlooking a forest that appeared more tropical than northern. The sky outside the warehouse had been black, but here it was a pale dusty color. Terrian thought about this. Apparently the card had taken him a great distance. A bird squawked with the sunrise.<br><br>Behind him was a wide one-story building with windows that didn't seem to allow light out from inside. Tuxedo boy headquarters. Terrian considered knocking, but decided it would be better to wait until Emily, Prime and Garth had come through the card.<br><br>So he walked over instead to the railing and admired the view.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Prime held his open hand into the air, and caught Dracon. Not hard, but enough to give him the idea of who he'd be travelling on. He yoinked one of Sly's pellets, with a nod to Nat, and stuffed it in his ear. "I'm still not really sure what's going on here, but I have an affinity for dragons, and I don't mind having my mind shielded."<br><br>He pulled out his gun, checked the ammunition, then put it away. "I don't suppose any of you guys left here could call a tow truck and get my bike fixed? No?" He shrugged, then starting walking down the steps.<br><br>"See you on the other side," he said nervously, though he kept his voice as level as he could. He tossed away his helmet, gave Valon and Nat a nod, and disappeared.<br><br>"Hey Terrian," Prime said, leaning on the rail beside him. "Evidently we are far away. The air is nice, at least, but I hate to think about the mosquitoes that much live here..." He cringed.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Wow..." Garth murmured. seemingly stepping into existence behind Prime and Terrian. He fiddled with the left lapel of his shirt, as if trying to secure it, and stopped suddenly. "Okay, okay." He took his hands away from his collar, and stepped toward where the other two were standing. Tipping his head back, Garth closed his eyes, and inhaled deeply. Pausing for a moment, he flung his arms out to the sides, almost as if embracing the air. "This is absolutely incredible... Where are we anyways?" <br><br>He returned to a more normal posture, leaning on the railing alongside the other two. A large crimson and cobalt butterfly, easily the size of a grown man's hand, fluttered daintily past the group. "Sly-" Garth cut himself off quickly, and sheepishly looked back to the others. "My gut tells me that we're somewhere out around Hawaii, though no clue on latitude. Something about the time of day or whatever."<br><br>"Now how am I supposed to whack his head on the doorway if the door isn't open?" Emily said loudly, appearing suddenly with the tuxedo-clad captive slung over her shoulders.<br><br>"Oh, wow!" Emily immediately shrugged off the man as if he were nothing, and darted over to the edge. Showing much less restraint than the others, she jumped up, landing on top of the railing, and then dropped to a sitting position. "Maybe we should all go on vacation here after this. It'd be fun!" Emily leaned out over the drop, holding herself steady with her hands on the railing. "You said Hawaii, right? I think I'd look okay in a grass skirt. Not sure about the coconut bra thing..."<br><br>"So, you're all here now, huh? Took ya long enough. Almost like you had to work out a cover story or something."<br><br>Garth and Emily snapped around, the boy's movement more one of fright, while Emily seemed to simply evaluate the new presence without losing her smile. A large steel desk with an ornate granite top rested about twenty feet away from the group, the unconscious man now sprawled on top of it. There was a massive, overstuffed chair, upholstered in a green faux leather, pulled up directly behind it.<br><br>Arrayed around the desk were seven men, one seated, one to either side, and the remaining four respectfully kneeling behind them, a pair to the left, and to the right. The seated man wore an elegantly crafted black tuxedo, his bow tie fixed perfectly and his salt-and-pepper hair combed back immaculately. The man to his left was much less formally attired, clad in hiking gear with his blue-black hair sloppily put back into a short ponytail. He watched the group with only one grey eye, the other one clamped shut. Two asymmetrical tattoos marred his wrists, white band on one, black band on the other.<br><br>The other man was wearing a grey, leathery-looking bodysuit, with large, orange-yellow barbs and hooks of a bony material jutting out at each joint. His head was cleanly shaved, only intensifying his already harsh-looking features. Beside him were two thuggish-looking individuals, one wearing what appeared to be loose leather armor over his immense frame, while the other, more compact one was wearing normal street attire. This however, was sharply contrasted by the bits and spurs of metal protruding randomly from his lower arms and hands, each one oozing blood like it was a fresh wound.<br><br>The other two kneeling men were much more common-looking, although both were wearing the formal attire of the earlier assailants. The one to the outside had shaggy red hair, hanging over his face down to his shiningly white smile. The other one was quite familiar, the man that had interrogated Brogue in the car. He, though maintaining the position, managed a smile and nod to Terrian.<br><br>"Don't be alarmed. These are just my business partners here, interested in the hottest prospect we've seen in the past five years. As you can see, you've caught the eye of some very important people, Mr. Brogue." The seated man leaned forward, watching the group with a bemused grin. He snapped his fingers, and the door to the building opened up behind him. A large, fluffy couch, easily big enough to accommodate the four arrivals, cantered out, bumping the door shut behind it. It trotted around the desk, and then deposited itself directly across from the seven men.<br><br>"All of you, make yourselves comfortable. Though I know that Terrian here seems to be the highlight of this whole process, each and every one of you also has very important aspects that I'd like to discuss." The man gave a knowing grin in the general direction of Prime and Garth, as if dangling bait over their heads.<br><br>OOC: Eh, not great, but it brings us into the final act.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Beelzebibble</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Terrian did his best not to limp over to the couch, hoping no one would notice that he was favoring his left leg over his right. He was also hoping no one would notice that Sly's metal earpiece had slightly inhibited his ability to hear. Lucky for him that the seated man was speaking at a nice leisurely pace.<br><br>He stood uncertainly in front of the couch for a second, debating where to take a seat, and somewhat relucantly settled on the middle. As he did so, he sent a thought to his duplicate back in the warehouse: <i>Tell Ender and Valon to be ready for more than just tuxedo boys when they get over here. Some of these guys look nasty.</i><br><br><i>What kind of nasty are we talking about?</i> was the response.<br><br><i>The spiky kind,</i> Terrian thought, as he looked around the gathering. After another moment, he put together a nice smile and some nice words.<br><br>"I know this is really kind of an awkward way to start things off," he said, "but I feel like I have to tell you what's going on with your unconscious friend there. He attacked those three—" (Terrian gestured behind him toward Garth, Emily and Prime) "—but they knocked him out and took him hostage. When we came through the card, my guy in the biker outfit wanted to pitch your man over the cliff, but I told him, 'No, Prime.' I said, 'Prime, we are just going to give these men their associate back and no funny business.' As a gesture of our good will, and to prove that none of us want to stand as enemies to you."<br><br>"Although," Terrian added with a look back to Garth, "I think my friend Garth here has been feeling a little estranged by your organization. Maybe we can clear his situation up first, before we talk about the job offer? Can we agree on an outcome that doesn't involve his eyeballs in a bottle on the mantel?"</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">hermes</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"I don't care about Garth," Prime said, scowling. His gun was in his hand, but he kept it carefully pointed away from anyone else present. He was paranoid, not suicidal. He strode forward slowly, and took a seat next to Terrian.<br><br>"Just tell me about this job opportunity, and why you need us for it. The opportunity for a little extra money is always nice, but I don't do suicide missions, and I do not become experimental data," he said firmly, as he'd known for a while now that there was something odd about him, but he couldn't quite pin down what it was.<br><br>He unzipped the front of his riding jacket, the full body leather suit and the heat were starting to get to him. Nevertheless, he acted as nonchalant as he could, making them think his sweat was only due to the heat.<br><br>"One more thing," he said, leaning forwards. "Whoever set up that field already owes me 80,000 dollars, cash, right now. That bike was expensive as hell, and it took me a lot of time and effort to assemble it properly and get it running smoothly." He gestured slightly with the tip of his gun, pointed at the businesslike figure they'd encountered before. "And my insurance policy has a clause that specifically exempts people like you." His voice was slightly edged, but he leaned back in his seat despite that, rolling his shoulders.<br><br>Just so Dracon knew he meant him to. He didn't have to snap his bike in half. Prime nearly heaved a sigh, but held it in. "What do you suppose we do to settle the account?" Prime asked levelly.</div></div>

The man at the desk simply smiled subtly, and after Prime spoke, raised a hand to silence the group.<br><br>"Eighty thousand dollars? Even assuming that we're within the realm of legality, and you wouldn't simply fall under not travelling at a prudent speed for the condition, eighty thousand dollars is peanuts." The man put his palms on his desk, and shifted forward. "Eighty thousand dollars buys you something <i>human</i>. We don't deal with that. Here..." He rapped his knuckles on the granite. "We are above human.<br><br>"What my group is... We're a group of hunters, if you will. Adventurers. Like many of you, but different. Focused. Orderly. We do our jobs swiftly and cleanly. There are no suicide missions for us, or experimentation. We leave that sort of behavior to others." The man looked directly at Emily, and nodded. "Anyway, as long as one succeeds at what missions we give them, there is no threat to their lives. And I never go throwing my subordinates into a suicidal situation. That's only wasting investments.<br><br>"If you're interested, then stay here after I've dealt with Terrian and the boy. They're the reason for this occasion, after all." The man raised his hand again, clearly ending his attention toward Prime. "As for you, Garth, mayhaps I should let one of the others explain it. There is much talking to do, and I've always had a sensitive throat. Nopcsa?"<br><br>"Gladly." The man from earlier stood up, brushing the dust from his knees. He paced around the desk deliberately, and with one hand, pushed the unconscious man to the side. He jumped up, and then dropped to sitting atop the stone with his legs dangling. Swinging his heels, he leaned forward and braced his chin with his palms. <br><br>"Your mind is a total jumble tonight. A bit of a pity, since it always saves time when I don't have to sift through a puzzle to carry out a conversation, but I'll work with you."<br><br>"What's going on with me?"<br><br>"It happens to every boy and girl eventually-" The man paused, and smirked slightly. "Oh, you mean with that mark on your stomach? Quite the interesting story, really."<br><br>"Go on."<br><br>"Anyway, it appears that you happened upon what our type refers to as Zodiac amulets. They're little discs that were strewn about the world years and years ago. Quite nifty little things. They'd bond to a user's soul, and grant them supernatural powers effortlessly."<br><br>"Why would it turn up in my house, then?"<br><br>"If you hadn't been nervously staring at the gun in your buddy's hand, you would have heard me. Strewn. Scattered helter-skelter. Fifty-two pickup. You know?"<br><br>"Aren't there only twelve signs in the zodiac?" Emily queried, a baffled look on her face.<br><br>"Pop culture reference, Emeril. Besides, there's thirteen." Nopcsa began talking again, cutting off a response from Prime. "Twelve normally acknowledged ones, and Ophiuchus, the Serpent, an outlier to the normal procedure." Nopcsa cocked his head. "Really, that thirteenth one was quite the ***** to deal with. We didn't even know if there <i>was</i> a thirteenth Zodiac amulet until we happened upon you, Garth."<br><br>"And that all brings us around to the whole situation tonight." Garth's expression twisted into a firm scowl. "So, now how are you going to explain how acting like you were going to cut my heart out was going to help me?"<br><br>"Surgery is always tricky. Surgery on a malicious magical item? Doubly so."<br><br>"Surgery? Malicious?" Garth seemed shaken for a moment before regaining his composure. "I thought that you said they were supposed to be nifty."<br><br>"In the right hands, yes. But you weren't right. The amulets, though not conscious, attempt to seek out the most compatible souls. And since yours wasn't finding anything more compatible where it was locked away, it merged with you."<br><br>"That's why it vanished!"<br><br>"Duh. And as you've seen... Being the most compatible soul in a group of one doesn't even mean you're compatible. Your body has been reacting poorly to it. To make a long story short, one of our contacts in the medical industry saw what had happened to you, and contacted us, knowing that any mundane operation would only make things worse."<br><br>"Did you really need to kidnap me and all of that?"<br><br>"Yes, actually, since most hospitals frown upon arcane rituals in the middle of the building. So we took you away, tied you down so that you wouldn't struggle and complicate things, and set about trying to suppress the amulet. Our big mistake was assuming that since you weren't compatible, you couldn't tap into its power. You woke up, and using an aspect of its might, destroyed the building and killed two of our men."<br><br>"I killed two people?"<br><br>"It happens. Besides, doesn't matter to me. One smelled like feet, and the other never paid his share at restaurants... I digress. If everything had gone well, we would have removed the amulet from your abdomen, and upon your recovery, would have given you a choice. Since saving you necessitated giving you knowledge of us, we'd either let you join us, or erase your memories of us and let you go back to your mundane life."<br><br>"And if I didn't want either of those?"<br><br>"You'd have done one anyway." He stopped talking, and looked back to the man in charge.<br><br>"Good enough. So, now you all understand what brings us here tonight. One big misunderstanding about a little lifesaving operation, and one of our men being an imbecile and getting greedy..." The man disdainfully glared at the unconscious one, almost as if looking past him and into the stone below. "Does that sate your thirst for knowledge, or are there any other questions?"<br><br>"What about this Ophiuchus thing? KILL ME?"<br><br>"Not right away. Over time, yes. But that doesn't matter right now. I'll talk with these three first. After that, then we'll negotiate your surgery. But until then..."</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Terrian had been ready to slap Prime for waving a gun around when they were trying to talk civilized, but then the salt-and-pepper man had turned attention back to Garth. All throughout this conversation, Terrian held his gaze politely yet firmly, and said nothing. Internally, on the other hand, the gears of his brain were churning madly.<br><br><i>Hey. We have a problem.</i><br><br>* * *<br><br><i>Should we come over?</i> his duplicate responded at once.<br><br>Brogue wouldn't have minded, frankly; his companions in the rear guard weren't exactly ideal. He'd tried to make some small talk with them, just to lighten the mood, but they hadn't given him much to work with. Valon, to whom it appeared all business was serious business, preferred setting his jaw in a grave grimace. And Ender just told Brogue to keep quiet and give his head a rest. Sheesh. All things considered, Brogue had been expecting the psion he'd met on the airship to be somewhat less... delicate.<br><br>But his hopes that things were about to get moving were let down when the original Terrian replied, <i>No no, not yet. It's just... Things are getting complicated.</i><br><br><i>Oh damn, and here I thought all this stuff was simple.</i><br><br><i>Yeah, ha ha, you're a funny one. Look, this whole Garth thing isn't as one-sided as we thought. If we're supposed to believe them, then there's, like, a Zodiac diskette bonded to Garth's soul.</i><br><br><i>Beg pardon?</i><br><br><i>Yeah, the thirteenth one. Orpheus the Serpent, or something, I don't know, I'm missing some of the details with this metal ball stuck in my ear. The point is, it's killing him. And the tuxedo boys were trying to track him down so they could remove it.</i><br><br><i>Okay.</i><br><br><i>Something like that.</i><br><br><i>So what's the problem?</i><br><br>Brogue cast his eyes nonchalantly around the warehouse, hoping that to Ender and Valon he seemed to be looking at nothing, while he listened attentively for Terrian's next thought.<br><br><i>I don't know who the bad guys are anymore.</i><br><br>* * *<br><br>Terrian heard a disbelieving <i>Seriously?</i> from his duplicate, but he couldn't answer immediately; the salt-and-pepper man was wrapping up the discussion with Garth and once again turning his attention to the entire group.<br><br>His mind raced, trying to process all this information. On one hand, he didn't have any reason to trust these people, and he didn't imagine Natalie would much like the thought of just leaving Garth with them to have his chest magically cut open. On the other hand, if they were telling the truth, then Natalie's group might be signing Garth's death sentence if they didn't let the tuxedo boys go through with the surgery.<br><br>Besides, the salt-and-pepper man had said that they wanted the thirteenth zodiac thing. Terrian knew from experience that the easiest lie to spot was the most altruistic one. This man had admitted a personal stake in the affair – something tangible he was trying to gain from this situation, beyond the arbitrary satisfaction of saving a life. Terrian found it much easier to believe him because of this.<br><br>Even so...<br><br>Christ, he hated decisions.<br><br>Well, he said nothing at the moment. He was half-hoping Prime would take some of the heat off him by blurting something out.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Prime shook his head. He could practically feel the gears turning in everyone's minds, as they took the situation in and tried to decide who exactly to classify as the bad guy. He was having the same thoughts himself, but he had a rather simpler solution.<br><br>"Just let Garth decide what to do, all right? We already decided we were going to back him up, none of us signed on to make his decision for him," Prime whispered to Terrian quietly, then leaned back in his seat.<br><br>"You seem to have forgotten how the real world works," Prime said to the trio. "I'll spare you the long-winded lecture, as you don't seem to give a damn either way." He looked at each of them in turn; his eyes fell on a skeletal hand around one of their necks, and he barely suppressed a shiver.<br><br>"I will say, however, that those of us who have a connection with the material plane, have a vested interest in what you call peanuts. It keeps me out of this place called 'prison'. And an 80,000 dollar loss is a pretty clear-cut kick in the balls. So, peanuts or not, how about you answer my question in a more straightforward manner?" he asked, looking straight at the man who seemed to be the leader. "Am I getting paid or not?" he bit off sharply, scowling.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Payment-" The man began again, clearly slowing his words. "Payment is a subjective term. What we offer here is typically not the payment that you'd find in the mundane world. We offer you a job. In exchange, we handle upkeep. We train and groom people for working with us, provide them with necessary equipment...<br><br>"That is not to say that money doesn't ever become involved. No, we pay enough to live comfortably, and to carry out one's quests for us comfortably whenever possible. But I don't think money is the important thing for one to gain from this. Money? As I said, it's a human trifle. We pay in power- Leverage if you will. Influence over things on a greater scale than is available to any but a few. When you have what we have-" The man reached into his breast pocket, and with a moment's delay, produced something shimmering in his grasp. With a backhanded toss, he sent the fistful of golden coins clattering to the deck.<br><br>"Wealth is simply the drivel that fuels the rodents in their wheels."<br><br><i>If you're expecting to be paid for your big boy's bike, you'll need to actually cooperate with us. If you're thinkin' you're going to make money off of stumbling into something beyond your ken, and not doing anything except for pissing and moaning, then it's best you hire a big fancy lawyer and take up your case with the folk in Whelkshore. We have much more important things to negotiate with several people present...</i> A voice spoke in Prime's mind, seemingly familiar but not a match to either of the men who had been talking.<br><br>"Now, since the girl is clearly bright enough to have followed what we said to the two other gentlemen, we'll let her mull over it while we deal with the main event of the evening." The man pushed against the desk, and his chair slid backwards noiselessly. He began to rise to a stand, and vanished into thin air. He reappeared, now standing, posture alert and straight, before Terrian.<br><br>"I believe that I have met somebody worthy of an introduction. Terrian Brogue, Auguste Tylor. Leader of the Fascere Order, its subdivisions, and other branches beyond that," He extended his hand, meeting Terrian's gaze with his own. "Now, Mister Brogue, have you ever considered a career in mysticism? If one has ever had a calling, truly, it is the arcane artistry for you."</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Beelzebibble</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Terrian felt an uncomfortable prickle on the back of his neck as he shook Auguste Tylor's hand. "It's a pleasure to meet you, sir," he said, "but I don't... mysticism? I don't know. I've seen people who use magic..."<br><br>He thought about a young woman twirling a ball of light around her finger outside a cafe in Olivine; an elderly man making a playing card appear in his hand on board an airship. And, for that matter, a young man raising his hand to the clouds, to be answered with a quiet rumble.<br><br>"They just don't seem like me. I don't think that's where my power comes from. If I really had a calling for the arcane arts, wouldn't I be throwing around fireballs and thunderbolts by now?"</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">hermes</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Prime massaged his temples, frowning. "Apparently I am talking to an idiot. I have asked, twice, the same question. Neither time have I been answered. I have not expressed a preference for cash, I have simply stated my wish to be compensated for my loss. Power, items, influence, I don't particularly care what you pay me with, as long as it has appreciable value," he said, staring quite angrily at the man. "However, though these are the things you tempt us with for the future, you have utterly neglected to answer the simple question I now put to you for the third goddamn time."<br><br>He stood up, holstered his weapon, and looked around casually. "Am I getting fucking compensated, or do I have to shoot one of your goddamn colleagues to get my fucking point across? I want compensation!" He scowled at the gold coins on the table. "Preferably something that doesn't make people think I'd stolen it from a history museum. Or a bank," he said flatly.<br><br>He was, of course, being intentionally unreasonable. He trusted these men about as far as he could spit into a hurricane. He had no doubt that they had very creative ideas on what to do with everyone present, and while he was here to back Terrian up, he had no interest in letting things go any further than they had to. He was pretty sure they'd gotten all the information they could, not it was time to split. Preferably with something loud and explosive as a distraction. They could take care of Garth's issue later, preferably hiring someone who wouldn't cut him to pieces as a last resort to get it out.<br><br>Prime caught Terrian's eye, trying to let him know what he was up to. He shot a sharp glance at Emily too, whose nature seemed to lend itself to a drifting mind, and not paying any bloody attention. His hand was near his gun, casual, unthreatening. He had the air of a man who knew he was going to get what he wanted, even in an impossible situation.<br><br>He waited, tensely, but resolutely. It was going to happen eventually, so they might as well be the ones controlling the situation, instead of the very, very dangerous suits.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"There is a reason that it is called the arcane arts, Mr. Brogue. Some of it can come from natural aptitude, but one's training is vastly more important when it comes to-" Auguste's eyes focused into a glare.<br><br>"You seem never to have heard of manners, I fear. Should I escort you away from here, or will you behave? The promise of future compensation should be enough for somebody to be sated with until I've finished a brief conversation with another..." The mage tapped his foot twice, and the man with the metal protruding from his hands rose from his knees.<br><br>"If you don't want to talk with us, nonviolently, we'll need to become somewhat less hospitable..." The man gestured, the underling moving briskly around the desk and to his side.<br><br>"Now, if you'd just let me finish my discussion with Terrian-" Auguste's cordial voice had become much harsher in tone, shifting from his earlier patronizing tone towards Prime to a new, icy menace.<br><br>"Anyways, Mr. Brogue, even without training in the mystic arts, I'm certain that you could be a tremendous asset to us... As far as I can tell, you replicate whatever is on you when you create a duplicate. I'm sure that a man of your intelligence would not fail to see how his talents might be helpful in a group that specializes in procuring enchanted weaponry and armor, no?" Auguste's tone switched like the flipping of a television channel. The moment he wasn't threatening to have Prime tossed over the edge, his voice had regained its friendly tone, and a smile crossed his lips.<br><br>"And thus you understand the main reason we've called you here," Nopcsa declared with a smirk, watching Terrian's reaction. "Quite simply, we're privy to the most valuable equipment and items that man can come by. And you're Terrian Brogue, Xerox incarnate. El-e-men-ta-ry math."</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Beelzebibble</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">When Prime looked at Terrian, he returned the man's glance with furrowed eyebrows. It didn't escape Terrian's notice that those spikiest among Auguste Tylor's associates had taken to rustling menacingly. Since Natalie, Sly and the dragon man hadn't demorphed yet, they must have wanted Terrian to keep the politicking up a while longer. Yet Prime and his gun were taking the conversation swiftly in the direction of bloodshed.<br><br>Terrian opened his mouth to apologize for Prime's words, only to be cut off by an acid rebuke from Auguste. Kinder, however, was the tone with which Auguste turned his attention once again to Terrian. And Terrian smiled gently as Auguste and Nopcsa outlined the reason for their interest in him, which naturally hinged on... ohh. Shit.<br><br>"Oh, of course," he said brightly.<br><br>They'd gotten him wrong. They thought he replicated whatever was on his person when he duplicated himself. They didn't know – but how could they? – the limitation. Only items that covered a wide enough surface area on his body were duplicated. His shirt, his underwear, his pants, his socks... The jacket and the shoes, even, it was hard to explain. Perhaps because they covered so much of the surface area of his shirt and socks—<br><br>But the wristwatch! And the wallet and the keys and the cell phone! None of these things were duplicated. And Terrian had tried – many times. How many hours had he spent, walking around in his apartment clutching a five-dollar bill and leaving behind duplicate after duplicate, bare-wristed and empty-pocketed and with open palms that held nothing at all...? He'd never managed it! He'd managed it once.<br><br>Once. Yes. An isolated incident. Several years ago. January second, in the morning. He'd been writing a grocery list in the kitchen. Some moron down the block had let off a batch of fireworks, left over from New Year's, no doubt. The booming crack had startled him into leaping back... and there, standing in his original position, had been a duplicate staring at the ballpoint pen in his hand.<br><br>The duplicate ballpoint pen was in some place of honor in his apartment. On the mantel maybe. The original, he thought, was in the briefcase the duplicate Brogue was holding back in the warehouse.<br><br>This was the one and only time Terrian had successfully duplicated an item held in his hands. He'd tried to accomplish it many times since then. No luck. It had been an accident, really. A fluke. Not to be repeated.<br><br>And here the tuxedo boys were expecting him to outfit them with a legion's worth of equipment. He <i>sincerely</i> hoped Natalie was going to put him out of his misery in another moment or two. "Although, I mean, duplicating items isn't easy. With clothes it comes naturally, but with something I'm holding... I have yet to perfect that process. Still, I imagine this job will give me plenty of practice." <br><br>He paused, felt this conclusion was a little weak, considered his options, and decided to risk it. "In case your boys are running low on socks, though, I can promise you up front I've got them covered."</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">hermes</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Prime met Auguste's menacing glare with a slight smile. He'd prefer threats to patronization any day. He was a huge fan of the direct method, that being: don't argue with those who're sure that they are correct. Bang their head on the table until they knew they were incorrect.<br><br>Unfortunately, the following conversation nearly made him hang his head. Even he could tell by Terrian's stance that he couldn't reliably replicate anything that wasn't already firmly attached to him. Prime quietly thought that what the man incorporated into his very soul's image, the mental picture he held of himself, was what he replicated. And only that. But hell, he wasn't quite sure how that was to work.<br><br>He gave a respectful nod to the bodyguard at the suit's side, recognizing that he was only doing his job, but his eyes were still cold. He had been... tempered by some of his previous experiences. And his cybernetic arm was an advantage none of them knew about. It was almost 99% accurate at distances of 40 meters or more, and this was well inside his range.<br><br>They'd only be able to evade if they could move faster than his more-than-human arm.<br><br>He had the feeling they could. He didn't like the idea.<br><br>He kept his gun at his side, unwilling to fully commit himself until the others did as well. He was here for support after all. But he also felt no need to get on friendly terms with those who were, essentially, the enemy. Unless they made him a good offer that didn't involve anyone else present dying. He could always use the extra capital.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"That was... As we feared, no, Tylor?" Nopcsa said with a shrug.<br><br>"Not quite. I had been expecting more vehemence in him asserting his independence, not something like this-" Auguste's smile took a slightly bitter twist. "But it's not the end of the world. We have magical shirts, coats, shoes... Even pants and socks, though those are understandably more scarce. If you're willing to do us a turn, just duplicate some of those for us... We'll be sure to pay you about ten percent market value. On each item."<br><br>"Considering that a simple shirt with..." Nopcsa turned an eye towards Prime and the guard, "A bulletproof enchantment... is  typically sold for a few hundred dollars, at least, it could be rather lucrative for you. A few hours of work and you could be financially set for months." <br><br>"Of course, we have a bone to pick about something," Auguste's tone became grave. "It really should be handled by Abatis and Nachoset... It's more of an issue for them, than it is for us."<br><br>"Of course," the asymmetrical one spoke, his closed eye snapping open to reveal a crimson cornea. "We were fine with you four. Two of you had appointments, and two of you were possible recruits. But as for the SEVEN of you, well, there's three in there that we're going to need to get rid of."<br><br>"What seven?" Emily asked brightly, then paused. She blushed slightly.<br><br>"What is it?" The man asked pointedly.<br><br>"Are you calling me fat?" Emily responded indignantly, starting to rise from her seat.<br><br>"No," the other man spoke, the one in spined armor. He flickered, reappearing on the other side of the desk. With another step, his was directly in front of Emily.<br><br>"We're just saying that you're crawling with parasites."<br><br>The man reached down, and plucked a small dark spot from amongst Emily's hair. Grinning triumphantly, he raised it before his face.<br><br>"You killed fifteen of my colleagues, and my leader. The Yalda Bahut lost his life to you, greedy wench. And to add insult to the brutality, you stripped him of his armor, and the Sceard that was rightfully mine to inherit!" His voice had quickly risen from a quiet threat to a manic scream. "And now, you die, helpless! Think in this last moment how you brought this upon yourself, Helogale Ulima!" The man crushed the tick between his fingers in a spurt of ichor. Emily simply stared in shocked disbelief.<br><br>"Did you know that you were harboring this wretch?" Nachoset threw the remains to the floor.<br><br>"Oh, sure I did. But I couldn't find him, so it got really annoying during that whole interview thing. You know, he kept biting me, and it itched worse and worse, and it's sooo impolite to scratch and-"<br><br>"Do you know WHO it WAS? If our scryers are to be believed, you were in league with that girl!"<br><br>"No, no, I'd think I know if I was friends with a tick. But I never would be friends with a tick. It just wouldn't work out. I'd go 'Hey, wanna do each other's hair?', and he'd be all like 'Nah, I'm just gonna hang here like a forty-year-old living in my parents' basement while running a Transformers fan site, sucking blood off of the more active and useful people' and I'd be like-"<br><br>"THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE TICK. IT'S ABOUT SYLVIA-NATALIE-ULIMA, HELOGALE. FIRST CLASS."<br><br>"Oh, it wasn't about the tick? So, you mean it's about that midge flying over your shoulder right now?" Emily's clueless smile became a smirk. Nachoset had only the time to gape before a sneaker met the side of his head and sent him sprawling into a yelping Garth's lap.<br><br>"Oy... I honestly have to say. For a cabal of evil mages, or whatever the hell you all are, you hold the most boring meetings on earth." Natalie flickered again, her unfurled sword appearing in her right hand.<br><br>"What should we do, Auguste?" Nopcsa asked, clearly already knowing the answer.<br><br>"You and I? We watch. The other ones were invited here for the battle we promised. They can take care of the five that want to fight."<br><br>The others instantly sprung into action. The man closest to Prime rushed at him, raising an forearm to block a shot at his throat. The bullet ricocheted off, skimming the man's cheek and tearing a bloody cut across it. He closed the rest of the distance in a moment, and threw a punch directly at the biker's eyes.<br><br>Abatis vaulted over the desk, and seized Nachoset by the scruff of the neck before hurling him aside. He pointed a finger at Garth's neck, and an intense gust of wind blew. A speck went spiralling out from under his shirt collar, and dropping to the floor behind the couch. Nachoset, moving with the momentum, brought up his arms, and flickered yellow for a split second. Nat dove for the floor, letting a sphere of flame shoot over her with a demonic roar. It kept traveling until well clear of the platform, and then exploded in a cloud of smog and concealed flashes of light.<br><br>"Hey!" Emily protested, and pointed at Natalie's opponent. There was a spray of sparks, and a loud ringing as her spike bounced away. The redheaded fellow, clad in the dressy uniform of the Fascere Order, held a kickboxing stance... Roughly the height of a man above the floor. His shoes, now visible, were short silvery boots, both with the soles glowing a light blue.<br><br>"Not bad at all!" He lashed out with a kick that was barely blocked by Emily, the force of the blow spinning the seat a good quarter-turn.<br><br>The man in leather armor slowly rose, and paced around the desk at a leisurely speed. He came up to where Prime and the man who had been beside him were brawling, and then simply sat down a short distance away.<br><br>"Let me know when you shake his passenger free. They told me he'd be the best one for me to face." Without a fight immediately occupying his attention, the man began humming something quietly to himself.<br><br>"Terrian? Garth?" Nopcsa asked, turning around to face them. "The battlefield is a place for spies and bodyguards, not old men, children, the unarmed-" Nopcsa indicated himself clearly, and then pointed to Terrian. "Or the wounded. We should get indoors before things get too rough."</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Prime took the punch to the face - truth to be told, he didn't have much choice in the matter. The man was insanely fast and terribly deadly in close quarters. Prime was just glad he had a good spatial perception, and an understanding with the law of gravity. That being, it always works. As the heavy punch landed on his face, and Prime fell backwards, he quickly and viciously raised his knee.<br><br>It caught his attacker in the chin, sending him flying in a trajectory roughly equal to Prime's. Prime unloaded his gun into the man's stomach as he sailed overhead. Though he had no clue how effective that would be, if at all.<br><br>That clue about bulletproof shirts was a little unsettling.<br><br>His weapon came quickly about as Prime rolled, taking a few shots at the man sitting beside him. He wasn't fond of those arrogant enough to think they couldn't get their hands dirty. And those who remained calm often controlled the chaos.<br><br>He brought his gun back onto his previous attacker, reloading as it sailed through the air, and started unloading it on him again, just to be incredibly and remarkably sure. He made a mental note to shoot the suits behind him. They'd said his tick wasn't welcome, that didn't give them license to attack him, it gave them license to attack the tick. Or, in this case, the pygmy dragon. With whom Prime was currently highly irritated, because he could've eaten his hooded attacker before Prime had gotten his shiny new black eye.</div></div>

Her first action, kicking the spiky-armored man toward the couch, was instant proof to Terrian that it was the right time to get off the couch.

He promptly sent a single thought -- <i>It's time</i> – to his duplicate.<br><br>In another couple of seconds came the response, <i>Okay, bring us over.</i><br><br>"To me!" Terrian muttered. And, standing above him, appeared the duplicate Brogue, carrying the briefcase and held on each shoulder by Ender and Valon. The latter two swiftly moved forward into the fight, but Brogue paused to survey the scene, bent down beside Terrian, and opened the briefcase. <br><br>"You'll be wanting the gun, then, I take it," he said.<br><br>"I don't know," said Terrian. "Maybe? No. No, you know what, leave it."<br><br>Brogue frowned, then leaned forward and shifted into thought. <i>Are we going to take down the tuxedo boys or not?</i><br><br><i>I don't want to.</i><br><br><i>Then we're betraying Natalie. Okay. I'm cool with that.</i><br><br>"No," said Terrian aloud. "I don't think I want to do that either."<br><br>"Terrian? Garth?" the one called Nopcsa asked, and then invited them indoors to stay out of the fight. Brogue looked back at Terrian.<br><br><i>Indoors?</i><br><br><i>Not yet.</i><br><br>Brogue rolled his eyes. <i>Look, I'll tell you what, pick a damn side and I'll support you on it. I'm just tired of you going all wishy-washy like this! You can't please everyone, Terrian. So don't even try.</i><br><br>Terrian cringed as shots rang out. He peered over the back of the couch. Prime was delivering the ammunition he'd been trying so casually to promise. Terrian leaned back against the couch, taking care not to put too much weight on his wounded leg, and smiled at Brogue.<br><br>"I won't," he said.<br><br>Then he got up and stayed seated simultaneously. Another duplicate – this one, again, paying no heed to his injury – had emerged. He rounded the couch and ran into the skirmish. Another duplicate did the same. Terrian created another duplicate. And another. A dozen duplicates, maybe sixteen, charged into the fray. But they weren't attacking. Instead they flanked the fighters in pairs and tried to seize their arms and shoulders, to hold them back.<br><br>Perhaps understandably, no one went after Nachoset or the barbed man, unwilling to get too close in nothing sturdier than a dress suit. Otherwise, however, they tried to contain all of the combatants. Two duplicates managed a swift tackle on the redheaded man and pinned him to the floor, while another two tried to be nice about restraining Emily. A particularly brave group even attempted to close with Natalie and Prime, neither of whom looked likely to give up the fight in a hurry. A chorus of identical voices, shouting instructions to one another, added itself to the previously existing sounds of the combat.<br><br>Terrian held out a hand weakly to the only undamaged duplicate Brogue, who helped him to his feet. Then he nodded to Nopcsa. Indoors would be best. He felt... faint.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">OOC: I think Terrian has a case of "aichurophobia- fear of being touched by pointed objects. " <img src="//images.proboards.com/f/smiley/wink.png" alt=";)" class="smile"><br>BIC: <br><br>Nopcsa nodded, and cleared his throat loudly. "So, who here is done fighting?"<br><br>"I guess that us two are. Not that I really wanted to in the first place," the redhead muttered, now airborne once more, a pair of Brogues dangling from his arms with their feet not quite touching the floor. Emily had not been seized, but instead seemed to be delivering recipe cards that she had produced from somewhere to the two Brogues assigned to her.<br><br>"I should help Natalie, really-" Emily started, but was cut off.<br><br>"No, this is all mine!" Natalie threw herself into the air, vaulting over a jet of flame and corkscrewing to the side. As she landed, she launched herself forward, blade extended. She shot past the six noncombatants, almost skewering Nachoset had he not disappeared. Her blade lanced into the couch, and her opponent reappeared in midair, punting the warrior in the jaw. She rolled back past the half dozen, catching herself on her feet and digging her blade into the wood of the deck to slow herself to a stop.<br><br>"I won't be restrained by the likes of you," Abatis growled through clenched teeth, straining against the two that held him. The one that held his black-tattooed arm suddenly collapsed, eyes drifting shut as he tumbled to the floor. The other Brogue stepped back reflexively, only for Abatis to spin backwards and strike him with his now-glowing hand. He fell as his twin had.<br><br>"A sleep charm. Which is much better than what you'll get, Andalite." Abatis stated, and jumped over the couch. There Sly was, lying on his side and trying to shift back into his natural body for battle. He was still mostly fly, but now grown to the size of a dog with stalk eyes and hooves jutting from his body.<br><br><i>&lt;You know?&gt;</i> Sly's forming eyes took a harsh focus on the man.<br><br>"I also know that there's a five-second drop beneath us, and that you won't be able to return to a flying form in that amount of time," Abatis said with a sneer, and extended his black-marked hand. An orange light glowed from the back of his left hand, coalescing into a flawless round gem. One that Sly recognized almost instantly.<br><br>"I've been following all of you for a very long time, Sly," Abatis murmured, and placed the back of his hand against the lumber. The orange jewel sparked with an unearthly light; a circle of wood was cleanly eaten away. Abatis stood up once more, and stepped back, over Sly. The Andalite lashed at him with his tail, falling just short. Abatis sneered, and raised the bejeweled hand before his face.<br><br>"Expand," he murmured, and the small hole quickly snapped outward, stopping right before reaching Abatis. Sly, still a mess of weak, half-conceived limbs, plunged through the gap and plummeted toward the earth, hundreds of feet below. With a grin, Abatis leapt after him.<br>--------<br>"You're not half bad for a human-" The man grunted to Prime, rolling to his feet with a bestial alacrity. He feinted to the side, three bullets tearing past him with inches to spare, and one tearing through his right bicep. He simply gritted his teeth, and lowered his gaze, focusing on the weapon.<br><br>At that moment, the Terrians burst in from either side and closed in on Prime. The barbed man grinned, and continued his charge. He drew back his hand and adjusted his course as if to aim a rushing punch at the Terrian on Prime's gun arm. As the duplicate drew back, the man refocused his path on Prime. He threw a knee to the other Terrian's gut, and wrapped his outstretched arm around Prime's neck, tackling him to the floor.<br><br>His left hand shot to where Dracon was concealed, and tore the small dragon clear of Prime. He flung it to the side, to his companion, before attempting to uppercut Prime in the stomach with the sharp barbs on his left knuckles.<br><br>The other man, his massive hand stretched over bloody wounds in his side, let out a noise similar to a laugh as the reptile landed on the deck beside him. He sprung to his feet, and whipped his head about, freeing an amulet on a length of leather chord from beneath his armor.<br><br>"So, you're my foe? Well, since they told me that you'd be worthy, I'll believe them..." The man's voice grew rougher, almost inhuman. His skin seemed to take on a grey-green tint as thorns and ridges began to burst out through his skin. The man's fingers stretched out to unnatural lengths, warping and hardening into long talons.<br><br>"The name is Uca Argentum and I'm proof of what a truly synchronized Zodiac Amulet is capable of, lizard." He brought the smaller, more nimble of his talons up to his chest, to what appeared to be a metal disc with two inwards facing nines. "Cancer. The crab, and-" The man's eyes shifted into soulless black fields and a series of pointed digits erupted from his cheeks, meeting around his mouth and covering it. They flared outward again with his next words.<br><br>"The death of you."<br>--------<br>"It seems that your attempts at peace aren't exactly panning out, Mister Brogue," Auguste stated quietly from the hallway as Nopcsa held the door open for them. The sunlight revealed a hallway that seemingly stretched much farther than simply building onto the mountainside would allow, clearly having to have been dug into the earth. The walls were of some unusual glossy stone, with various paintings and works of art suspended from them. Many doors branched off to the sides, each one crafted of some rare-looking ornate wood.<br><br>"Hey, they can't all be winners, right?" Nopcsa moved as if to punch Terrian in the arm, glanced at the beleaguered traveller, and reconsidered.<br><br>"I can't believe that everybody out there is so bloodthirsty-" Garth whispered, his eyes wide. He winced as Natalie roundhoused one of the Brogues that approached her into the desk, and then uppercut him as he fell. "I mean, the people in Whelkshore are supposed to be heroes, right? And your guys just wanted to help me... So why is it that they all are trying to kill each other now?"<br><br>"Not all of us," the redheaded man said, dropping from above. Emily was on his back, piggyback style, hands in the air.<br><br>"That was fun!" Emily said with a childish laugh, and then slipped free of the man's back. She stepped around him and into the hallway where Terrian was resting. Ignoring the others, she turned back to watch Natalie's battle.<br><br>OOC: Not sure what else to do with our negotiators/noncombatants, since the Broguesplosion was unexpected, but hey, we'll figure something else out. Right now, it's kinda Dracon/Prime's big scene in one part of the deck, Natalie's in another, and Valon/Ender should be doing something involving the skydiving Sly and Abatis, since that sets up a big revelation for the BB/DL plot arc.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">The original duplicate Brogue joined Emily's side at the doorway to observe the fight, but Terrian himself preferred to look over the strange hallway – and, in another moment, to turn to Garth.<br><br>"The people in Whelkshore are supposed to be heroes?" he repeated. "Where did you hear that?"<br><br>When Garth met him only with a nonplussed look, Terrian added, "I mean, the first time I met a Whelkshore power, she was a pretty cool lady, but..." He laid a finger on his cheek uncomfortably. "Well, she and I were part of a group who were, basically, infiltrating a magical institute for nothing but personal gain. We caused quite a bit of damage in the process, and we attacked scientists and researchers who'd done nothing wrong and had no vendetta against us."<br><br>He chanced a glance around at the three present tuxedo boys after saying this. Nopcsa's lips were pulled down in a <i>Hey, what can you do?</i> smirk, but Terrian couldn't tell from Auguste Tylor's expression whether the older man approved or disapproved of this confession. The unknown redheaded man was watching the battle with Emily and Brogue and so appeared not to be listening.<br><br>"I met two of the guys out there on board an airship, and they're both fine too, but I wouldn't really have called them 'heroes'. You know? They do whatever they need to do. That's the whole vibe I get from Whelkshorers." Terrian added his last remark in a murmur to Garth, Nopcsa and Auguste: "Especially Natalie. That girl over there pretty much worships her—" (he jerked a thumb toward Emily) "—but trust me, Garth, Natalie's the one the rest of the Whelkshorers are answering to right now and she would <i>not</i> have been a contender for the Superfriends."</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Valon was standing just outside of the battle area and took in all the actions for a few moments.  Abatis' presence was troubling, but he was the only one he was worried about, and the appearance of the orb was even more troubling.  Valon watched Sly falling through the opening in the deck in shock and then witnessed Abatis leap after him.  Valon didn't give himself time to think, he dove through the opening at an amazing speed after Sly.  Valon easily caught up to his friend after a part of a second and tapped him lightly, engulfing his body in an orange light causing the still-transforming being to float in midair.  Now that his best friend wasn't in danger of becoming a smear on the ground below, Valon turned himself on Abatis.  A split second later Valon had Abatis held by the throat, his windpipe pressed to the point of being slightly blocked but not life-threatening.<br><br>“You filthy little vermin.  You think that you can just kill my best friend and have me stand by and allow it?  I thought you would know better Abatis.  Ha, now I can see that you have the eye as I had heard, but I will never let you bring that monster back to the world of the living as long as I still draw breath,” Valon almost hissed as he gripped Abatis a bit tighter.<br><br>A wide smile formed on Valon's face and a rich smell filled the air much like that of freshly falling rain.  A rippling effect appeared above Valon's skin and began to take the image of purple flames but as viewed through smoke.  The amethyst flame focused around his hands and head, but appeared all over his frame.<br><br>“Think yourself lucky.  I've never actually shown anyone my true aura, but you get to be the first.  Impressive isn't it?  Ha, enough of these formalities.  Goodbye.”  And with that Valon booted Abatis in the chest, sending him rocketing forward at an incredible speed.<br><br>OOC- Valon finally gets to do something!!</div></div>

One specific and extremely brave Brogue attempted to tackle Sly from behind. The Andalite's tail disappeared before reappearing wrapped around the Brogue's middle, holding him aloft in the air.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Prime bit back a scream as he was partially eviscerated. His stomach was still in one piece, but only barely. He lost all logical thought as he grabbed the man by the throat with insane strength and speed. The man coughed as his grip slowly tightened.<br><br>"Die!" Prime screamed with hellish rage, violently stuffing his gun into the man's face and emptying the clip at point-blank range. The gun jarred against his hand and shoulder until the clip was empty, though Prime couldn't feel his arm to know whether he was holding onto the bastard anymore.<br><br>He threw the Terrian off him, stumbling around dazedly. Bastard had better hope Prime didn't see him, or there would be a reckoning. He whipped the pistol into the side of a Terrian's head, just to see what would happen, but it didn't seem to have any effect. Dazed, he looked around for his prior mark, wanting to make his last word a certain future. However, with the blood loss, the opposite was looking more likely.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Pretty good, pretty good..." a voice rasped from behind Prime, clearly choking on the words. The man, somehow having shifted his location in the split seconds since being shot, clutched an empty flask in one hand, and a mending wound in his cheek in the other.<br><br>"Not this time!" The man lunged in, batting Prime's gun aside with enough force to fold the joint in the prosthetic arm back at the elbow. He seized the dying man by his good arm, leaning into his face.<br><br>"Do you know where the steel in my arms come from, human?" He jerked his head aside, barely avoiding a headbutt. "Some of my comrades found a peculiar sword in the course of their expeditions. Since the tradition in the Fascere Order is to implant artifacts into members to make it more difficult to steal them, this katana was a bit problematic..." He raised his leg, blocking a knee aimed for his gut. "We melted it down, and implanted the pieces into my hands... Lovely, right?" His left hand shot to Prime's throat, clearly strangling him in retaliation for the damage to his own throat.<br><br>"You know the cool thing that this enchanted sword did, by the way?" The man let go of Prime's arm, and wrenched him about by his choking hold on his neck. Looking him in the eyes, he drew back a crackling fist, and sneered. "It ripped out people's souls." <br><br>The man threw Prime back, lunging forward into a perfect punch. It caught Prime in the ribs, his weight suddenly going limp. The man drew back, smiling as his opponent fell to the floor heavily.<br><br>"You were dead before you felt my touch."<br>--------<br>"Sly! I- I thought that guy killed you!" Garth's attention was almost immediately drawn away from the raging battle. He glanced back for a moment. "I thought maybe I should've gone after him with my powers, get some kind of revenge, but then I thought, this whole thing was started by you trying to protect me from all the people trying to hurt me. And if I failed to kill him, I know that he'd kill me instead-" Garth paused, trying to think of the right words.<br><br>"That's one death so far. So much for the optimistic end of the betting pool, Tylor," Nopcsa said amiably, leaning just inside the doorway of the structure.<br><br>"Of course, Mister Brogue ruined Nachoset's wager on them all dying, so I'm feeling good about my middle-ground pick. If two more bite it, I take the pot." The redhead grinned, leaning out past the mindreader.<br><br>"One of them is facing Abatis, and Nachoset swore he'd kill that shapeshifter girl. That makes your odds look pretty good." Nopcsa turned to Terrian. "Of course, since you'll be working for us, I'll have to let you in on standard practices here. For example, Fridays are casual day. No capes, crowns, or pointy hats allowed then. And Wednesday is potion-sampling-"<br><br>"Nopcsa, enough with the chitchat. I have to say something." Auguste looked to the beleaguered young man. "Of course I knew about that heist. The Parmigianino Institute has a contract with us in R&amp;D. They reported to us, and other contract holders, when their weaponry room was broken into..."<br><br>"And watching the scrying was how we ended up learning of you. So don't think you're surprising anybody here with that dark revelation," Nopcsa glanced at his wrist. "If this doesn't wrap up in another ten minutes, I'm going back to my room. This runs a little late for me."<br>--------<br>Abatis simply grinned in response to Valon's pronouncement of judgment, a glow forming about his white-banded hand. As he went flying backwards with enough speed to splatter him against the rock face of the cliff, he clasped and opened his hand. His backwards flight stopped suddenly, a web of light embracing him from all sides. He dusted himself off, winced slightly, and then stepped down.<br><br>"It's good to see that you recognize this here. If you didn't, I would be severely disappointed in your reputation. But it seems that you live up to what I've heard. The memory of a dragon, indeed. No putting something by you-" Abatis raised his black-tattooed arm, the skeletal hand rising with it. It drifted into place, securing itself against the back of his hand. There was a flash of silver, and its fading revealed a gigantic platinum cleaver, clutched in the mage's grasp.<br><br>"And I'm sure that you remember how the whole Basilisk thing works," Abatis muttered, bringing down the weapon with a relieved breath. It slammed into the cliffside, shearing through it without any resistance. He turned to Valon with a sly grin, and stepped away from the cleaver, letting it dissolve as rubble tumbled down where he had struck.<br><br>"So, I took the liberty of planning ahead for this engagement accordingly." Abatis jerked his thumb over his shoulder, toward the cavern revealed by his strike. Slumped in the darkness was a pale, shapeless human form. Long locks of greasy hair piled around its atrophied body, and empty eyes gazed out of the darkness uncomprehendingly.<br><br>"It's a crude clone, really, but pretty much the best I could do on three days notice." Silver wires extended from the skeletal hand, taking up the orange gem from where it had fallen. The wires jerked, and sent the gem streaking through the air.<br><br>"You know what comes next-" Abatis stepped aside, raising his left hand. A platinum shield appeared, stretching until it obscured him entirely from view. Moments later, a torrent of blue-white flame crashed into the cliff face, exploding back outwards with the force of a bomb.<br><br>"Not that much good... You see-" The shield lowered again, crumbling into powder. Abatis stood there, mostly unharmed except for a few burns on his arm nearest the blast. "This cliff face, and its contents, are warded so as to prevent anybody not authorized by the Fascere Order to do harm to it. Thus, the choice in location for-"<br><br>"<i>I'm ready, Master.</i>"<br><br>"Oh, delightful. Well, you catch my drift, Ruler of the Dragon Races." Abatis turned, and acted as if to walk away.<br><br>"<i>I agreed to this servitude, just so that I could have the pleasure of making you and your friends suffer once more...</i>" Orange eyes, each the size of grapefruit, blazed with hellfire from the depths of the cavern. A pair of dripping fangs, each yellowed ivory except for the venomous green lines running down their sides worked up and down with every word.<br><br>"<i>You were the first to fight me, after my apotheosis, were you not?</i>" The figure stepped forth, his bald head catching the spotty light of the forest. Muscular arms, ending in hands with talons the length of steak knives, tensed and moved experimentally. "<i>You'll be the first I get to butcher, now that I've returned...</i>" The figure lurched into the light, clearly hunched over from the confines of the cavern. He stretched his arms out to either side, stretching its pitch black form. A pair of gigantic grey wings snapped out to either side, feathers shooting into the air all about it, and slowly drifting earthwards.<br><br>"<i>So, how about it, <b>Valon</b>?</i>" Basilisk hissed, darting forwards with speed beyond the realm of human vision. It lunged for his throat with outstretched claws, jaws slavering.<br>--------<br>"Helogale Ulima! Stand and fight!" Nachoset roared, a fist of crimson fire building around his own for a moment before being flung at the shapeshifter.<br><br>"Like hell I will!" Natalie flickered, the fireball roaring through her. She rushed forward, running her fingers along the back of her sword to lock it into a single blade. Extending her right hand, she thrust for Nachoset's throat. Sparks flew as he snagged her weapon between the bony projections on his suit. "Tell you what-" Natalie ducked a backhanded swing as Nachoset used his leverage to snap the blade of her sword. She lunged in again, clipping the side of the armored man with the broken point of the weapon.<br><br>"I have no need for whatever you're about to say, wretch." Nachoset vanished, reappearing behind Natalie, and throwing a spined elbow at her back. She jerked forward, avoiding the brunt of the blow, and then tumbled away, regaining some distance from her opponent.<br><br>"I'll quit with the dodging and all that if <i>you</i> stop with the f***ing porcupine flamethrower suit bulls***." Natalie's arm snapped forward, flinging the shattered remains of her sword at her foe. He bent back, the weapon streaking over his head. Natalie flickered, and reappeared in midair above the man. She seized her blade, and dropped at him.<br><br>Nachoset threw himself to the side, tumbling out of the way as Natalie impaled the deck and sliced a wound across his back. He rolled to his feet, and met her with a glare. "Since there was no replacing the Sceard that you stole from us, we had to compensate somehow in the newest armor we made... Once I take the Sceard back, I'll be the strongest one ever to hold the rank of Yalda Bahut." Nachoset's armor began to glow with flames building around it.<br><br>"Wonderful. I'd say that this is the sound of me not caring, but it's more the sound of me wanting you to die really badly."<br><br>OOC: Not as big of a post as I'd thought it would be... *Sigh*</div></div>

First scales began to form over his skin, black in color, shining nicely in the sun's rays.  Next his eyes became reptilian, the pupils retracting, and then dilating fully, turning a yellowish color before finally settling into a nicely colored amber.  Spikes erupted from his spine and shoulder, looking like long jutting tusks.  His arms grew, and his body structure changed to that of a four-legged creature.  Flexing his claws he dug into the flooring underneath him, easily shredding it.  Small wings formed, and then erupted into huge elegant wings made of bones and skin. <br><br>"Now," Dracon said, slamming his teeth together causing sparks, "you will know what fighting an ever-changing opponent will be like!"

Terrian was growing ever more concerned that one of the duplicate Brogues would be sliced in two at any minute.

"I'll take that one back, then."<br><br>Sly lowered the duplicate to the floor, where he immediately turned again toward the door. "You're not withdrawing the troops, are you? Come on, one more! You all saw me, listen, I was this close to flooring that barbed guy—"<br><br>But the first duplicate Brogue, the one who'd been observing the whole evening, stopped him at the door. "It's over."<br><br>The original Terrian stood up, still leaning against the wall for support. "Sorry, man. <i>To me</i>."<br><br>The pugnacious duplicate had only enough time to give Terrian a withering look before he flickered back to him.<br><br>Terrian nodded to the first duplicate, understanding that he still wanted to remain outside. But he approached the door, looked out to the combatants, and murmured again, "<i>To me</i>."<br><br>At once, all fifteen or so of the duplicates on the deck – some injured, some prone, and some still in fighting form – blinked out of sight. Terrian braced himself for the expected mental rush as all the thoughts and memories of those duplicates flooded his brain. And... some index cards materialized in his pocket. He glanced at them. Recipes. Also standing by the door, Emily grinned at him.<br><br>Terrian looked over the battlefield again, now bereft of his avatars. He supposed he should be most worried about Valon, who was facing down not one but two unnatural aberrations. But Valon seemed the strongest of them all, not an easy force to bring down. Meanwhile, Natalie had one of the spiky ones... oh, no, strike that... one of the spiky and <i>on fire</i> ones... but she didn't look worried. Good thing, too. If she died just then, Terrian imagined she'd haunt him for at least a week.<br><br>The dragon one – Dracon, that was it – was up against an enormous man who'd changed into some kind of half-crustacean. Terrian tensed; he didn't like crabs. He looked away quickly. Who else? Sly, Emily and Garth were all here. Where was Ender? Terrian searched the deck for the familiar face, but Ender was nowhere to be seen. On the roof, maybe. Or else he'd simply taken off. Why would he have—?<br><br>Terrian felt a sickened swoop; he'd forgotten someone. Prime. He was lying on the deck in a pool of blood, his chest area torn asunder. His head was turned aside. He wasn't moving.<br><br>Terrian saw his duplicate follow his gaze to the body. The same sudden look of hollow shock passed over Brogue which, Terrian imagined, had settled on his own face as well.<br><br>Prime – Well, Terrian hadn't really thought tremendously of Prime, hadn't appreciated the man's arrogant bravado during the negotiations earlier – but there, see, his mind was already distancing itself from what had occurred. The fact was that Prime was an innocent who'd had no more stake in this than a damaged motorbike. And since Terrian had led them to this place, if Prime was dead... it was his fault.<br><br>He rounded on Auguste and Nopcsa, ready to speak. But they were both gazing back at him quite placidly... They looked, in fact, bored. Terrian realized that he had nothing to say to them: nothing on the subject of the Parmigianino Institue, or casual Fridays, or the death of Prime, or anything else, really.<br><br>A welcome voice sounded in his head.

It expanded almost instantly, engulfing him in a fortress of colossal bubbles as the cyclone of flame descended upon him. There was a sizzling as the foam disintegrated under Dracon's assault, a cloud of steam rising into the air.<br><br>"But not good enough!" A clawed hand burst from the steam, slashing across Dracon's snout and leaving four lines of blood. The transformed warrior threw himself out of the cover of the roiling vapors, attempting to impale Dracon's throat with his other hand.<br><br>"It doesn't matter how versatile you are..." Uca threw his face forward, spiny visage hurtling toward Dracon with a meteoric impact. He leapt back, regarding whatever the results of his savagery had been. Small antennae on his jaws worked back and forth, almost like a living beard.<br><br>"Raw power is the ultimate decider!"<br>---------<br>"One healing potion, that was all it took to patch up what you did to me, buddy. You talked so tough that you didn't even <i>consider</i> what I could do to you..." The man with barbed hands wound up and delivered a solid kick to Prime's corpse. He glanced around, and then gave it another nudge with his foot.<br><br>"I'd advise you to stop that now," a voice came from above, full of authority and menace. The man glanced up, and instantly stepped back. Abatis hovered above him, the mighty beating of metal wings keeping him aloft. Now with room to land, he let his batlike pinions flap one last time, rifling the wind through his blue-black hair. He dropped from the skies, landing on his knee by the side of the fallen warrior.<br><br>"So, this is where it's all taken you, hmmm? All the troubles and pain you've gone through, and this is how it ends?" Abatis stood, flakes of platinum drifting away from the wings as the began to crumble away. He glanced up, his red eye glowing as he looked out towards the horizon.<br><br>"Not really fair, is it? You lived each day assuming that there'd be something more, at least that you'd have time for one more breath. But you stumble into this, and-" A stray gout of flames from one of the battles shot past Abatis's face, the mage cringing from the heat. "You get slaughtered for simply wanting what belongs to you. Truly, there is no justice in this world..." Abatis took hold of the skeletal hand, and lifted it before his face.<br><br>"There is something that can be done, though... Before you dissolve into the aether, or are ferried to your final resting place... If we work quickly, you can get another chance. I do not know what state you'll be in after this, but..." A glimmer of cerulean passed across the wires on the hand, cast by a light in the sky. "You could have life again. Another chance to live, to experience. To be with those you care about, to do that which you will. Freedom is to be had, the right to influence things is to be had." He drew his hand back against his breast, clutching it tightly.<br><br>"This... would be a gift. All that I ask from you, in exchange for fixing this horrible mistake of fate, is that you do not use it to harm me or that which I care dearly about. I'm sure that you understand. I let you have all that you treasured, and you leave me to my own treasures."<br><br>Abatis silently extended the ghastly remains, holding them out as if awaiting for some invisible party to take hold of them. The blue light, glaring down with unusual intensity, seemed to move closer...</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Something shot across the horizon, and Prime's eyes opened. The hand in Abatis' hand suddenly blazed with violent azure energy. It reached down and shocked Prime's body, leaving him gasping for air. A star was suddenly hovering over his body, the hand wrenched from Abatis and hovering over Prime's chest. A blaze of white light descended from the star, through the hand, and into Prime. An expanding shockwave shocked everyone present, and the floorboards shuttered.<br><br>Covered with azure light, Prime's body rose into the air, his arms spread out. His head hung limply back, looking up at the heavens with blank eyes. The star sank into his forehead, like a smoky memory. His cybernetic arm blazed into nothingness, as the skeletal hand moved into place, and regenerated his whole arm in a blaze of azure light. Another Prime stepped out of nowhere, this one dressed in black robes, standing before his counterpart. As they were watched, they seemed to step into each other, and another flash of bright light temporarily blinded them.<br><br>Prime felt himself descending into a darkness, through a long place he'd travelled often before, but never consciously. He found himself standing in a forest, but it wasn't normal in any regard. The land was black, pulsing with a red screen over the surface at regular intervals, like waves. The trees were white, glowing with an inner light, and had glowing azure leaves on their branches. They fell slowly from the trees, creating colorful swirls that were taken away by the red waves. He was standing on the crest of a mountain, looking at other mountains in the distance. They were covered with the same white trees, pulsing black and red underneath, like waves.<br><br>"What do you want?" a soft voice asked kindly. <br><br>Prime turned around, somehow unthreatened by this presence. "I'm not sure, what am I supposed to want?" Prime said, as he turned. <br><br>He was facing a naked women, with long white hair. She had vibrant green eyes and soft, angular features. She smiled at him, warmly. "Perhaps just to live - you are dead, you know." <br><br>Prime nodded slowly, and looked back over the landscape. "Yes, I want to live." he said slowly, "But where's the point in just living?" <br><br>The woman walked up beside him, a smirk curving her lips. "Where indeed? So what do you want?" she asked again, she seemed amused.<br><br>Prime's brows furrowed, he was thinking. "I want to fight, I've always wanted to fight." She nodded, just listening. "There's always been this part of myself questioning whether that's right, whether I'm somehow broken and inhuman because of it. But more than that, there's a part of me that accepts it without reserve." He shrugged, turning his head to look at the woman. "Who are you?" he asked, but she shook her head. <br><br>"I can't answer that yet. Look," she said, pointing upwards.<br><br>Prime looked, there was a black moon in the sky. It seemed ominous but familiar. He had the feeling he should fear it, but he did not. The woman nodded again. "I thought you might react that way. What do you remember?" she asked, and Prime turned toward her, about to ask her why she'd ask such an odd question, when memory suddenly hit him. He remembered hours, endless hours, practicing the blade. With a man, his father, and his mother watching from the balcony. She was beautiful when she smiled, he'd forgotten how beautiful his mother was when she smiled like that. Prime found himself smiling as well.<br><br>The woman in front of him smiled as well, and reached into thin air. At length, she pulled out a very long katana, slowly curving and pure white, with azure sigils on the blade. She handed it to Prime, and he took it gratefully. "An old friend for a long journey," she said, then leaned forward and kissed him on the brow. "Fight and grow stronger, it's who you are, who we are. What you fight for determines what kind of man you are." She started to move away, then stopped, turning toward him again. She smirked, and gave him a little wave, and suddenly he was standing in the middle of a battle again.<br><br>The light around Prime faded, and those nearest could see something new in him. Those who were closer to the spirit world could see a sword in his hand, a very long sword. The air and wood and stone around Prime suddenly warped and condensed, forming a long vessel that the whole world could see, a long nine-foot blade with sigils carved into it. The spirit sword came to inhabit it, and suddenly it was bright white with azure sigils all down the thick blade.<br><br>Prime turned to an astonished Knuckles, whose face was white with shock. There was a flash, a white line was drawn through the center of Knuckles' body. The stronger people present had only barely caught Prime's movement, the sword bisecting the poor soul. Prime flourished his sword professionally, a look of focused anger on his face. Knuckles fell into two halves, the sword in his body broken. Prime watched the soul rise out of his body, and watched Knuckles turn several interesting shades as he realized Prime could see him. "Goodbye," Prime said, a slight smile on his face, and this time he stuck as if at nothing to everyone else.<br><br>There, in the midst of all of them, something arose that perhaps only Prime could see. A hellgate rose from the ground, and opened. A great hand emerged, clutching Knuckles' soul until he screamed horribly, and dragged him down into the depths of hell. The gate closed, and its image shattered. Prime shook off his blade, and sheathed it, and slowly observed the chaos around him. "Right, who wants a hand?" he yelled, looking for someone to test himself against.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Valon turned slightly to the side just as Basilisk's claws were about to tear open his throat.  The razor points sang as they darted past Valon at a near-supersonic speed; the wind from Basilisk's index finger caused a shallow gash to appear on Valon's face.  With a quick movement just as fast as Basilisk, Valon drove his fist into the side of the monsters head with a sickening crunch.  The set of blazing orange eyes locked on Valon as a grin formed on his face.  A well-placed kick sent Basilisk sailing forward as Valon put his hand out and summoned the Aruafon.<br><br>“Challenge accepted, demon.  As you can tell I've gotten a lot stronger since the last time that we met.  So, if you think that you can take me on by yourself then I invite you to try,” Valon taunted as he pulled his glowing blade up in front of his face.<br><br>Basilisk's maw pulled into what appeared to be a smile as his mighty wings stopped his movement.  Before anything else could be said or done Basilisk appeared before Valon and bit deep into his sword, shattering the blade and causing a rain of green light to fall toward the forest floor.  Shock washed over Valon's normally calm face and Basilisk took advantage of this momentary distraction.  His mighty claws locked around Valon's throat and he pushed his face up toward his opponent's. The stench of rotting breath and blood was overpowering.  Black sparks surged from Valon's chest and crackled around the contact between Basilisk and himself.<br><br>“Ha, you talk big for someone who can't even stop me from breaking their sword.  I'm going to gut you and send you to hell so you can be with your bastard brother, scum of a father, and your whore of a mother!” Basilisk laughed as he launched Valon toward the building above like a missile made of flesh.<br><br>Valon smashed into the side of the building with a loud crack and a shower of splinters.  Valon's prone form rolled to a stop at Terrian's feet; blood seeped from Valon's cheek onto Terrian's shoe.  Another loud sound brought Valon back up to a knee with a look of sheer murderous rage.  Basilisk stood in the gaping hole with a clawed hand extended.  The next few moments went by in a blur, but once everything became quiet again Valon was on his feet holding Basilisk back. Three of Basilisk's five clawed fingers had completely passed through him and were just inches from Terrian's face.  Valon turned his head to the side so that Terrian looked toward his ageless green eyes.<br><br>“There's something important that you have to know. There are gray areas but when it comes down to it we are the good guys.  It's time to pick a side Terrian,” Valon said as a trickle of blood fell from the side of his mouth.<br><br>Basilisk smiled and began trying to turn his claw inside of Valon's chest but was met with only a burst of strength and was tossed through the ceiling above.  Valon threw a hand upward and smiled as his aura flared around his body. The room burst to life with the scent of freshly fallen rain.  Crackling energy pooled in Valon's hand and a grim smile formed on his face.<br><br>“GRANDEUR WAVE!!”<br><br>The upper portions of the building vanished as the massive wave of energy ripped through the structure, turning the wood and steel into nothingness.  The beam lasted for a few seconds and then faded away from view.  Basilisk was nowhere to be seen but Valon knew that even a point-blank Grandeur Wave wasn't enough to take the monster out.  Valon took a quick knee and let his aura flare for another moment.  He pulled at his jacket until it was nothing but shreds and looked at his chest.  Three thick holes ran through his form, dark red blood spilled from them and black sparks danced around their openings.  Valon grabbed at his neck and found what he was looking for.  A blue half-moon pendent rested on his skin, and at Valon's touch it shone a silvery light.  The odd silver light washed over Valon's body and seemed to close his wounds, but they were not totally healed.  The lunar silver color melded with Valon's own aura and filled the room with a purple and silver light show. The scent of rain was joined by that of night-blooming flowers.  A wave of the newly appearing silver energy shot from two spots on Valon's back and reformed into a pair of large white wings covered in feathers that bore a silver sheen.  Valon rose back to his feet and launched himself into the sky.<br><br>“I know you're hiding Basilisk.  Show yourself if you're not afraid of the light of the Lunar Dragon!”</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Prime watched Valon's energy attack shoot into the sky, fast, but not quite fast enough to catch his prey. The thing called Basilisk used the attack for cover, and was currently engaged in a high-speed maneuver designed to flank Valon. Prime could sense power an order of magnitude above his own from the monstrosity, but based on what he'd observed so far, he thought he could be of some help. To those around him, he seemed to take a step, and then he wasn't standing there anymore.<br><br>Prime flashed into existence a little behind and above Basilisk, his sword a white-and-blue lance of motion toward the thing's neck. It sensed him right before the sword impacted, and shifted, deflecting it away with little more than a scratch in its armor. It kicked out towards Prime, and he raised his elbow marginally to intercept the blow, and was knocked back several feet when it impacted. He skidded to a halt in midair, shaking feeling back into his arm; it was almost entirely numb. Basilisk sneered at Prime, who grinned back.<br><br>"I know, I'm a wiseass. You're fatally slow, maybe you huge powers don't feel the need to go so fast when you can throw stars at each other, but beware those who've not discarded speed," Prime said, and took another step, flashing into existence behind Basilisk. He took a wide swipe at Basilisk, but cutting him was never his intention, and his sword skittered uselessly across Basilisk's hide. He purpose, however, was reflecting the sun's light off his blade, and directly at Valon. His hope was to get the heavy-hitter's attention, while the demonic monstrosity was otherwise distracted.<br><br>Prime ducked under a wide backhanded swipe, losing some hair in the process. He stepped back, and flashed into existence around ten feet away, his sword pointed at Basilisk's neck. Prime could hear a menacing hissing coming from the creature, and he nearly grinned. It was really quite fun, being impudent.<br><br>OOC: Forgive, I don't know much about Basilisks attack patterns, personality, or general abilities. Though fare warning to Lee (it is your character right?) if you start getting serious on Prime with Basilisk, I will die or shikai.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Dracon beat his massive wings, sending gusts of wind throughout the area. "Brute power?"  Dracon said frustratedly, angry by his opponent's non-sensible mouth parts, writhing and clicking.<br> <br>"That's right," the humanoid-arthropod responded with glee. It could be heard in his screechy, slithering speech, even if it seemed that no emotion could come from his still-exoskeletal face.  "I'll make sure to teach you what it is like to get a good thrashing!" The creature, thing, what have you, crept closer to Dracon, its hard shell making a cracking noise, the joints in between visibly bending with each step.<br> <br>Dracon stood his ground, lowering his head, and positioning his dragon body ready to charge, and tackle. <i>If he wants to fight with brute force... I'll do that</i>.  Dracon's wings melted away, and his body shifted again, scales changing to a gold color, and a large plate extending off of his Dragonoid head, spikes jutting outward along the edges.  His eyes flared a red color, and a spike extended outward from his snout.  Flaring nostrils, and what seemed to be evolution's version of a continuous angry look, peering at the foe.  Dracon let out a loud roar, flame shooting from his nostrils, charging forth.<br> <br>The pathetic excuse for a sea creature charged forward, slamming its huge claw down into the ground, sending a ripple of destruction toward the charging dragon.  Mr. Krabby jumped backward, landing hard on the ground behind him. Dracon skillfully jumped the ripple and his toe caught the very crest of the wave, and he slammed with all of his force into the ground, leaving a gaping hole into the flooring.<br> <br>The crab man let out a shrill shriek of joy - well, whatever kind of noise a crab could make with the mouth parts that he possessed. It was more or less a high-pitched rubbing sound being made by the minuscule claws attached to its inner mouth. <br> <br>Huge wings billowed outwards, as Dracon took a second attempt at creating a powerful Dragon.  The dragon was black again, but its jaws were much larger and more powerful, as well as its legs and arms, designed for ripping apart enemies.  <br><br>"Well, well," Uca said laughing, the claws near his mouth moving about excitedly.  <br><br>Dracon didn't even bother trying to explain what he was about to do, but it would finish the crab off for good.  "I hope you like lobster," Dracon said, energy swirling around him.  The massive wings folded over resembling giant organic cannons. Whipping around, they locked onto Uca.  Dracon opened his mighty maw, and purplish energy began to build up.  <br><br>Uca ran forward bringing up his giant claw, trying to come in for a swift attack on Dracon.  <br><br>Right before impact, the three beams fired at Uca, the insides of the zodiac monster boiling, air escaping from inside its shell creating what appeared to be a shrill cry.  What was once a white shell, now was a brilliant red, the eyes still and gray.  The beast fell over, a crack in the shell which fluffed out white flesh, resembling that of a lobster.  <br><br>The zodiac's effect began to wear off, leaving only a charred pile of human remains.  Dracon shifted back to his human form, looking for his companions, shortened of breath and energy. </div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">The faint glint of the sun from Prime's sword struck Valon in the eye and drew his gaze to the beast he had been looking for.  In a brief flash of purple light Valon vanished and reappeared behind Basilisk, already in mid-punch.  The King of Dragon's fist smashed into Basilisk's skull and sent the monster rocketing downward, but it was recovering quickly.<br><br>“Thanks kid, I owe you one,” Valon said quickly and sent himself plummeting after his demonic target, gauntlets of purple flame engulfed his hands as the crisp scents of rain and flowers washed over the area.<br><br>Basilisk and Valon met each other in midair with a fist to the face.  The two seemed to be of almost equal physical strength, but they both knew that there were things beyond brawn that would determine the winner of this battle.  The two combatants began to move at amazing speed, striking each other with every ounce of strength that they could muster and when that seemed to go nowhere they began to resort to more amazing means of battle.  Basilisk called upon his demonic power and made his claws far sharper than they had once been, while Valon hardened his aura into a set of physical gauntlets tipped in a pair of razor sharp katar-style blades.  The two seemed to be dancing in the sky; lights flashed, bodies moved, and weapons clashed making an almost musical noise.  It would have been beautiful if the two weren't trying to kill each other.  After a few minutes of this high-speed dance of death, Valon and Basilisk broke off the attack from one another and hovered about twenty feet apart.<br><br>“You've gotten better, worm,” Basilisk's rumble rang out through the area as if he were speaking from all directions.<br><br>“So have you demon.  If we had met at a different time, I could have thought of joining with you.  Too bad for you, that time is past,” Valon answered with a smirk.  Though he wouldn't admit it to anyone, he was truly enjoying this battle with every fiber of his being.  “Let's finish this.”<br><br>“Gladly.”<br><br>The two warriors shot toward each other and in a blinding flash, they met with great force.  As the light faded away, an amazing sight stood there.  The two winged figures were standing within a foot of each other, Basilisk with his claws inches from Valon's throat and Valon with his right hand deep in the mouth of the creature.  A wide smile formed on his face and his aura flashed to glowing life.<br><br>“Sorry Basilisk, but I'm tired of you.  Grandeur Wave.”<br><br>OOC- Lee, you are free to auto as needed in your post sir.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">OOC: Lee and Clicker collaboration power is GO!<br>BIC: <br><br>Basilisk's eyes narrowed for a moment, and his threatening arm darted forward. It grew, as if a construct without bone or any kind of constraint. It touched the very edge of Valon's throat, beneath his kingly chin, and then ceased again.<br><br>The abomination was trembling, the light in its eyes blazing more violently than ever.  It furrowed its brow, the air around it screaming. Two gouts of blood and skin erupted from Valon's shoulder and chest, shallow but gruesome wounds. The light started to grow again, the eyes taking on the aspect of the sun, and then suddenly went dark. The back of the creature's head was ballooning out, at first cartoonishly, and then grotesquely. There was a tearing noise, lasting only the barest of a moment, and then everything turned white.<br><br>From below, it was impossible to perceive the full magnitude of the blast. It looked almost like a wall of azure, stretching out from the palm of the Lord of Dragons, and passing directly through the Fascere Order headquarters and even the mountain behind it. Though it had been constrained by Valon's willpower, keeping the attack from immolating the innocents below, they could still feel the heat radiating from it. Directly beneath the blast was almost like singeing oneself on a flame.<br><br>The heat and noise began to fade, the light dimming. Valon glared disdainfully at what was left of Basilisk, a charred corpse and a set of ivory jaws, still clamped around his arms. The last dwindling bits of the attack drew back around his arm, engulfing the remains of his foes. The azure flames shimmered slightly, black motes dancing through them, before finally being reduced to nothingness. He flicked the flames away, leaving his hand outstretched.<br><br>"And now, it is over."<br>-------<br>In the hallway below, Auguste was leaning against the wall, face toward it. His breathing was somewhat irregular, a few drops of sweat visible on the back of his neck.<br><br>"Boss?" The redhead queried, putting a hand on the man's heaving shoulders.<br><br>"I'm fine, Aythya. I'm fine. None of us are dead from that blast. Possibly a few employees that failed to heed the warnings about the coming battle, but I'm sure we lost nobody important. After all, the seers and such had us move most of the valuable merchandise out of the middle, there." Auguste turned to face the group. He was slightly pale, though in places his face was red. Most likely slight burns from being near the doorway when Valon had let loose.<br><br>"Personally, when they said that whole spiel about flames sweeping through and walls being knocked flat, I thought that it was going to be Nachoset and somebody. Or somebody dropping a cigar at the postgame party, butcha know. A gigantic bluey-white-energy-whatsit is fine, too." Nopcsa smirked at Terrian, who seemed to be the only one present who was doing worse than Auguste.<br><br>"So that's what a Power can really do..." Garth said quietly, from behind Sly. He had stepped as far back into the hallway as he could manage without leaving the group, avoiding the sounds of battle and the smell of blood.<br><br>"Some of 'em. But most aren't really that bad. For example, I'm a Power, and I'm probably less dangerous than the usual guy with gun. Well, unless you give me a gun. Then I'd be a bit better off. But then again, you give a guy with a gun shoes like mine, and he'd be-" Aythya was cut off by Auguste's raised hand.<br><br>"Wouldn't he have to take his shoes off first, though?" Emily asked. A loud crash caught her attention.<br><br>Oblivious even to the apocalyptic destruction unleashed above them, Natalie and Nachoset were still at each other's throats. Natalie had flung Auguste's chair at Nachoset, only to have him shred through it, and continue on a direct course towards her. Bits of fluff lingered in the air for long seconds, and were almost immediately immolated as the armored one burst into flames again.<br><br>"I know you, Helogale." Nachoset sidestepped a stab, flickering as the attack was turned into a slash. It passed through him harmlessly. He raised an arm, catching the returning blade on his spiked forearm. Sparks and chips of bone flew.<br><br>"Big whoop! So does the waitress at the Golden Griddle, but you don't see her kickin' my ***!" Natalie twisted, snapping off the end of the blade, and lunged forward. Her weapon struck home, lancing into Nachoset's side. A bit of its broken tip jutted out of his back, blood pouring freely from the wound.<br><br>"I <i>know</i> you, Natalie. You stole this power <i>from</i> us, and still, are crude enough to make the assumption that we wouldn't know every..." Nachoset stumbled in agony, falling forward. One of his blades skimmed Natalie's arm, cutting her slightly.<br><br>"Little..." Nachoset's arm lashed out, grabbing the warrior by her feet and pulling. She fell onto her back, hard. Even with how furious she was, Natalie couldn't conceal her shocked expression.<br><br>"Thing." He dropped to his knee, placing its vermillion spine against the girl's throat. He extended his left hand, the broken remains of a charm bracelet dangling from it. With a snap of his wrist, he flung the trinket aside.<br><br>"You BASTARD!" Natalie roared, straining against the spine. Nachoset placed the palm of his right hand against her forehead, slamming her back into the deck.<br><br>"You're useless now. No more powers." Nachoset grabbed the hilt of the sceard blade, and slowly drew it out of his side. He hissed slightly as the jagged tip reemerged from the wound. "No more weapons." He tossed it over the railing, into the forest.<br><br>"You're just a defenseless little girl, with nothing left to protect you. The only thing between you, and your well deserved <u>death</u> is the fact that I'm supporting my weight on my other knee." Nachoset smiled, a bit of bloody drool rolling down his chin. "The one thing keeping you alive at this moment, Helogale, is the mercy of the Yalda Bahut."<br><br>"You think I'm scared? Do you honestly think I am?" Natalie glared at him, defiantly raising her head. She started to raise her arm, only to have it slammed back against the wooden floor.<br><br>"I know you aren't scared. Anybody with any measure of fear in their hearts would not have the gall to interfere in my work..." Nachoset's grin grew wider. "But I do know that you absolutely and truly loathe this. Powerless before your enemy, barely able to even raise your voice against them without risking death. You can suffer here, living out the worst of your nightmares, before I kill you."<br><br>Nachoset slowly began to lean forward, the spine pressing into Natalie's skin. The girl shouted something like a strangled curse.<br><br>And then, Nachoset tumbled aside, bone chips flying from his armor. He rolled to his feet, catlike, and faced the new threat. The spike on his knee was clearly shattered, a deeper circle revealing where it had been hit. A large lump was forming on the side of his head, crimson running over his ears.<br><br>"You say that she had nothing, there. Nothing to protect her against your hatred, your blind rage over something she did that was totally right." Emily was tossing a hairbrush up and down with one hand, her other still rummaging in her purse.<br><br>"And you were totally, totally wrong. She might not have had anything of her own to rely on, but she had something better than that. She had her friends." She stood expectantly, the hairbrush taking a twirl to it on its next bounce.<br><br>"Is that so? I'll need to take that away from her, too!" Nachoset flickered, immediately transitioning into a full on charge at the girl.<br><br>"Emily, get out of here! You're not-" Natalie shouted, her voice ragged.<br><br>"Not what?" Emily stood her ground until Nachoset was mere feet away, and then threw the brush to the ground. The armored man lowered into a slash at Emily, and found himself falling short- and then falling flat on his chin as his footing rolled out from under him. Emily twirled away, flicking a fistful of recipe cards at him. Each one hit home, drawing more red lines across the man's bare scalp.<br><br>He flickered to his feet with a roar, throwing himself into a lunging punch. Emily stepped aside, and her purse shot out, deflecting his swing. As he turned to face her once more, she tumbled past him, grabbing a chunk of brick that Valon's attack had blown free. She landed on her feet, and jumped backwards, clearing the stone desk and the unconscious member of the Fascere Order in one go.<br><br>Her opponent was swiftly after her, leaping over the obstruction, and slashing at Emily. His blades found their mark this time, but only skimmed her lightly. A brick to his shoulder had yanked him back at the last second, reducing the lethality of the strike. Another flurry of recipe cards struck him in the face, blinding him as Emily slid under the desk.<br><br>"Enough foolishness!" Nachoset snarled, and slammed his fist into the floor. A wave of fire exploded outward from it. Nowhere near the magnitude of Valon's attack, but enough to blow Emily into the clear, and leave her clothes singed and a few wisps of hair glowing. She tried to jump to her feet, but her opponent was immediately upon her. He threw aside, the girl slamming into the wall of the headquarters. He followed immediately, catching her as she bounced back from the impact. He spun about with her in his grasp, bringing his armblades up to her throat.<br><br>"And that will be all. I know that none of you- AGH!" Nachoset cried out in pain. Emily had pulled a container of hand sanitizer from her purse, and crushed it into the side of his head. The goop was mingling with the blood of his myriad wounds.<br><br>He took a few breaths, stabilizing himself, and then tightened his grip on her.<br><br>"This time, I've got her. If any of you even try to help her, I'll rip her throat clean out. Do you all get that? This girl is going to die, one way or another."<br><br>Emily, more notably than at any point since arrival, looked downcast.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">A long, azure blade tapped lightly on Nachoset's shoulder. Prime smirked slightly as the man looked over his shoulder at him.<br><br>"If she'd going to die, no matter what, that doesn't give me much reason to freeze does it?" Prime said. "It just means you want us to die meaninglessly for her, and whether we do or don't, you'll still kill her anyways." Prime shook his head sorrowfully. "So instead of freezing in fear, I personally, am more than glad to hold on to a little hope, and move courageously."<br><br>Prime held up a small charm in his off hand, the chain was snapped but seemed otherwise intact.<br><br>"Piece of advice," Prime said, as he threw the charm back to Natalie. "Never forget about the unknown factor in a battlefield. When I came here, I was a human variable. As soon as that changed, you should have changed the situation."<br><br>Prime started projecting his voice, so everyone could hear him clearly. "This pointless fight is over, put aside your weapons and go about your own ways. Valon and I are freed from combat. I won't speak arrogantly on my own behalf, but with the two of us helping out our remaining comrades, you really don't hold much of a chance." <br><br>Prime gazed piercingly into Nachoset's eyes. "Let go of Emily, allow me to supervise the removal of that thing from Garth, and this can all end peacefully. I'm well aware that business knows neither good nor evil. So long as you aren't planning world domination, I see no reason why we can't leave you alone."<br><br>"You have anything to add, Natalie?" Prime asked. "Besides a feral desire to kill this man, of course?"</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Terrian slid up to his feet and made it to the doorframe to assess the scene. There was Prime. Prime was alive. A couple of other figures out on the deck looked much less so. Maybe the battle had... Ah, no, wait. Emily. Terrian fished around in the briefcase to see how stealthily he could aim the Mage Masher at the snout of the one who was holding on to her. But before he could do so, he heard Prime speak.<br><br>"Ohh..." <br><br>He approached Auguste Tylor. "Oh, listen, this is an opportunity right here. My pal Prime out there wants to end this peacefully. <i>Prime</i>. He's not even complaining about his motorbike. This is the best chance you're going to get."<br><br>He coughed briefly and raised an assuring hand to the lone duplicate Brogue. "So, I'm pretty sure – let me run this by you – here's the part where, in an ideal world, you step in and tell the big guy to let Emily off the hook. Right? After that, you gentlemen get what you want: Garth's Zodiac amulet... and my employment."<br><br>Terrian paused for a moment, but Brogue's nod encouraged him. He went ahead with it.<br><br>"Because I really <i>would</i> like to see what I can do for your organization. But I also don't want you to tell me to hurt anyone out there."</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Valon hovered silently as he judged the damage done.  Two wounds on his upper torso and a ring of bleeding teeth marks around his arm; not too bad, for he had received worse from weaker foes.  Black energy danced across the openings on his chest, but the strangest feeling came over Valon that they had nothing to do with the psychotic demon he had just battled, but were oddly familiar.  Calling on the power of his pendant once again to cleanse the disease that was surely in his wounds, Valon dove quickly to join the standoff below.  He landed on shaky feet and willed a long spool of bandages into his left hand.<br><br>"If he tries anything, I've got the girl taken care of.  It's nothing a little silver magic can't handle." Valon nearly whispered but was clearly audible though his regal tone.<br><br>Slowly Valon began wrapping the bandages around his arm and then his chest. Black-red blood stained the cloth even as quickly as he could cover it up.  It had been a long time since Valon had faced something nearly as powerful as himself and, thought he would never admit it, he was physically and mentally drained.  He could always rely on his instincts but that generally got people around himself hurt and that was something Valon couldn't live with.  Once all the dressings were in place and he had a moment to properly compose himself, Valon glared at the man holding Emily with a fire that seemed to sear from the pit of his stomach.<br><br>"Don't fool yourself boy.  If you try to do something stupid, you will die.  It may not be me that kills you, but you'll die nonetheless.  Actually, hope that it's not me that gets to kill you - you wouldn't deserve a quick death," Valon spouted with a bile that hadn't been heard in a long time.<br><br>Valon honestly meant what he had said, he really hoped he didn't have to kill this man because he wasn't even sure he would be able to aim properly to do it.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"So, that's that. It's over, Nachoset." Natalie smirked confidently, and waved her allies away. "Thank you, guys. I can take it from here."<br><br>She flicked her wrist, and a small coil of silver was tossed into the air. It jingled as she caught it. “The O-Sceard. The most powerful shapeshifting device ever encountered by the order of the Mamba, and indeed superior to even Andalite technology in some aspects...” She let it slip through her grasp, grabbing it between two fingers. She spun it, the jingling cadence matching her steps.<br><br>“Helogale!” Nachoset snarled, his grip tightening on Emily.<br><br>“Yeah, yeah, whatever. Gimme my own little pet name since I gutted a whole bunch of your buddies and ripped your boss to tatters. Act like I'm some monster because I destroyed the same warmongers that tried to kill my best friend's family. What the f*cking ever.” Natalie threw the chain skywards, and waited a moment. It plummeted back into her palm with a click.<br><br>“You step outside your bounds, girl! The right of the Order of the Mamba is an absolute! We own all of Africa! We're well on our way to owning the entire Old World!”<br><br>“Uh huh. Bunch of f*cking pussies. Y'all are just hiding behind each other, afraid that somebody with some real f*cking guts is going to step up and show you just how tiny and weak you all are. And the real reason you guys hate me? Because I'm that person.” Nat stopped smiling, and met Nachoset's gaze. The flames of the Fascere Order headquarters were reflected in the green of her eyes.<br><br>“I had you! You were dead! You WERE mine!”<br><br>“Pfff. Tell ya what, you milquetoast excuse for a warrior...” She flung her hand out to the side, the bracelet jangling in her palm. “I can settle this. I'll give you this. You can have the best Sceard, the most powerful armor. Take 'em, and get out of my sight. And in a while, not that I'm going to tell you when, I'll head out to good ol' Africa...<br><br>“And I'll kill every single one of you. That's my promise.” Natalie raised a hand, and lobbed the bracelet into the air. <br><br>“Here you go, you sorry son of a b*tch.”<br><br>Nachoset grasped for the trinket as it fell, the chain tumbling over the railing. He released his grasp on the girl, and threw himself over the edge.<br><br>“Whoops!” Emily kicked a jagged shard of wood from amidst the wreckage into her hand, and then flung it over the edge. There was a roar of pain, and then a thunk.<br><br>“I didn't think he wanted to land on his head. So I pinned him to that tree down there.”<br><br>“Yeah. He... He can go and get that bracelet later. Let's get out of here.”<br>--------<br>“I guess you're the loser here, Mr. Tylor,” Garth declared, wiping some dust from his cheek.<br><br>“By what measure? Sure, the first handful of my men were defeated. But the Fascere Order is not some insignificant band. I've got dozens more operatives on hand, waiting for such an event to occur.” Auguste stood up straight, an indignant note rising.<br><br>“Boss, do we really have to?” Aythya hovered slightly behind the leader of the Order, concern spreading across his face.<br><br>“Look at them. Covered in wounds, barely standing... They couldn't handle more than a couple of our men before they succumbed.” Auguste glanced outside, to where Natalie, Emily, Prime, and Valon had gathered. “Send the order, Nopcsa. Terrian, if you wish to abstain from the assault, feel free. They will not live to tell of a victory tonight.”<br><br>“Nopcsa's not sending any orders,” a voice, familiar and confident, spoke from the shadows. A figure, clad in a heavy trenchcoat, had his arm around the mindreader's throat. A sinister force crackled around his hand.<br><br>“And who would you be?”<br><br>“Those people out there, my friends? They call me Ender. But you can just call me the guy that shut down your entire backup corps. They're all taking naps right now-” The psion changed his grasp on Nopcsa, who seemed to be regarding the deadly hand with a mild annoyance. “Some more painfully than others.”<br><br>“You couldn't!” Auguste's facade of cool control had broken. His eyes were wild, like those of a beast in a trap.<br><br>“There's a difference between a straight fight and implanting memories that convinced most of them to go to bed early. But they've been neutralized. So, if I were you, I'd be getting out my checkbook and giving the people that want pay some green to line their pockets.”<br><br>Auguste sagged against the wall again. He seemed much smaller than when the night had begun.<br>-------<br>“So, Terrian's staying with 'em?” Natalie daubed at a cut on her face with a swab soaked in alcohol, wincing slightly.<br><br><i>&lt;Yes. It seems that he's found somewhere that he needs to be.&gt;</i> Sly didn't seem to be much worse for wear. His morphing technology had ensured that. If one glanced closely, they'd note a concerned squint to his gaze, but it was almost completely obscured by the dawn's shady illumination.<br><br>“Ehhh, let him stay,” Natalie spat on the wood of the deck, and glanced over her shoulder. The dashing young man, substantially less dashing than when they had first met, was distantly regarding the forest from the edge of the balcony. A handful of his copies were bustling about, sweeping up shards of glass and mending broken timbers.<br><br><i>&lt;I wouldn't interfere even if I thought it would help. His dealing, for better or worse, are his own.&gt;</i> Sly let his shoulders droop slightly. Though he had assumed his human form, he still seemed to be using his thoughtspeak. Most likely a matter of confidentiality, or mayhaps just sparing Terrian the awkwardness of being the subject of discussion.<br><br>“What about the others?”<br><br><i>&lt;Prime seems to have gotten a very sizable check. I'm not sure what happened to him afterwards, but he's no longer around here. The last I heard from him, he mentioned something about “upgrading”. Probably looking into some repairs for his motorcycle, which I certainly could understand.&gt;</i><br><br>“And the wimp?”<br><br>“I negotiated a deal with Auguste.” Garth's voice was surprisingly strong. Natalie jerked about, turning to face the young man.<br><br>“What's the deal?”<br><br>“I'm going to work for them, part time. They'll be putting my wages towards finding some way to fix my condition without me losing these powers. And the rest of the time? I'll get to live life as normal. Not as bad of a deal as I was expecting.”<br><br><i>&lt;Indeed. I'm guessing that our ace in the hole had something to do with that.&gt;</i><br><br>“I just made it so Auguste couldn't threaten Garth. The rest was him.” Ender pushed his shades up the bridge of his nose. With the rising sun, they certainly were more helpful than they had been throughout the long evening.<br><br>“It seems our young friend has taken a few steps forward, just in the time that we've known him.” Valon's grandiose tones echoed off of the damaged building and the mountain behind it. Garth blushed deeply as the King of Dragons patted him on the back.<br><br>“It's not like he didn't have any help, though,” Dracon rumbled from a corner. He had been hunched over a sketchbook since the moment he had returned to human form.<br><br>“That is true... Thanks, guys.”<br><br>“Sorry to interrupt this heartwarming moment, but I've got some news for you all.” The man known as Nopcsa had stepped into the midst of the group. He had a bandage around his left shoulder, apparently having been wounded by Ender's rough treatment of him earlier. “No, it's not that anybody particularly important died or anything. At least, not right now. But on the bright side, you all can get out of our hair, and go back to screwing things up in Whelkshore City.” Nopcsa sidestepped a punch from Natalie. “C'mon, no hard feelings. There's no way we can afford to have any right now.” Nopcsa shrugged slightly.<br><br>“We can,” Natalie growled in response.<br><br>“True, true. But if you do anything terrible to me, I wouldn't be able to tell you guys that Auguste cleared our teleporter room for you guys to go home in. And it's a pretty long walk home from the islands here.”<br><br>“Don't worry about me. I think I'll be staying around here for a while.” Dracon didn't move from his spot.<br><br>“Not going back to the Archipelago?” Garth's voice had quickly lapsed back to wavering.<br><br>“Not right now. Something about Hawaii really... just speaks to me. I think I've got some exploring to do, after a bit of a nap.” Dracon smiled distantly, and then stood up. “I'll let you guys know if I'm around.”<br><br>“Cool, cool.” Natalie was already heading back toward the building. She spun on her heel for just a moment, facing back over the balcony, and shouted.<br><br>“Hey, you! Mopey! Don't think that, just because you've got these buddies now, that I won't skin ya alive if you screw up again!”<br><br>She didn't say anything else, though the last few words of her threat came back in a faint echo. A moment later, she'd stepped into the darkness of the building.<br><br>“Don't let that deter you... If you find a chance to stop by Whelkshore, you're always welcome,” Sly spoke, using his human voice at long last. There was a warmth to his voice, and the morning sun gleamed off his eyes, “Even if it didn't work out quite right, you tried to do the right thing.”<br><br>“That's the only thing that matters, in the end,” Emily spoke from behind Terrian, her sudden speech jarring him out of his reverie. He turned quickly, and almost fell to his knees when the pain from his leg hit him. <br><br>“Sorry!” Emily grabbed him by his upper arm, supporting him the best she could. She slipped a small wax paper bundle into his palm. “It's a bit of cake I whipped up before I got here... I guess it's kinda saying sorry for the whole Natalie stabbing you thing.” Emily shrugged as she ushered Terrian back to the railing.<br><br>“Cake usually makes me feel better when people stab me, after all. Maybe it'll do the same for you.”<br><br>Terrian simply nodded quietly as the brightly garbed girl walked away.<br><br>“Thank you,” he faintly said, after she had already left.<br><br>With more crinkling than should have been possible from such a small parcel, he unrolled it along the railing. As it opened up, he found himself looking at a slice of halfway smashed cake, resting on its side. The frosting was the same shade of orange as the sky.<br><div align="center">The End</div><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler2084425').toggle();if($('#spoiler2084425').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler2084425">Wrapped this up when I had a spare moment.
