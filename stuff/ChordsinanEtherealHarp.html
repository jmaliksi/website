        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Like old times, isn't it, Helen?" Abatis stood still, looking down from the rail of the Olivine lighthouse. His blue-grey hair blew back in the wind, ruffled like the wings of a bird. Helen, dressed in a much more modest dress than her usual, this one a muted shade of lavender, sipped slowly from the glass in her hand.<br><br>"I don't think things can ever be the way they once were, you know?" Helen said, and looked down at the ocean below.<br><br>"Something weighs heavily on your soul, no?" Abatis looked at Helen, concern in his eyes. Helen looked up at his familiar assymetrical gaze, the red and grey of comfort to her. She shrugged.<br><br>"It's nothing... Really."<br><br>"It is. Ever since I took you as my apprentice, I've always known when something troubled you."<br><br>"Abatis?"<br><br>"Yes?"<br><br>"Whenever I cast a spell, I destroy something. Not just disintegrate it... I remove it from existence entirely. Nothing left except for the magic. And that returns to the normal streams of manna or such eventually..."<br><br>"And?"<br><br>"Well, this method of casting might be powerful and all, but it does destroy matter permanently... I was thinking that if I keep abusing it, I'll eventually make something bad happen."<br><br>"So, you wish to learn another school of magic than the 'Spells of the Unbound Chain'?" Abatis asked, running his hand across the cold metal of the rail.<br><br>"Yes. You know I have a natural talent for learning magic."<br><br>"I know, Helen. You're the best student I ever had."<br><br>"Do you have any other possible schools of magic for me to learn?"<br><br>"No, I'm afraid not. I know you. Black and white magic are too bland for you... You prefer something that works outside the natural order of magic, something totally obscure and exotic... Right?"<br><br>"As always." Helen said with a slight smile and a toast of her glass.<br><br>"I don't have any new innovations... But I do know of something else. There is a school of magic being created by some of my contemporaries... Something really innovative."<br><br>"Yes?"<br><br>"Of course, with mages being the way they are..."<br><br>"I'm going to have to infiltrate and slash or destroy whatever building they use for this research, right?"<br><br>"And steal their notes on the new school. It's called the 'Rebellious Orator' school of magic. As far as I can tell, it exploits an ambient magic that has yet to be tapped into. This naturally makes it something that is somewhat risky, but it shouldn't be too much more difficult than anything you've tried before."<br><br>"Gotcha." Helen downed the last of her drink.<br>--------<br>Helen Mercury swirled her finger in the air, a ball of light she had conjured orbitting around her fingertip. She sat at a table in the alley behind a popular caf√© in Olivine, focusing her magic ambience and trying to radiate as much magic energy as she could. Hopefully, anybody who could sense magic would pick up on her as that of a powerful magician. This sort of thing always worked for luring in the magicky types, or at least those with superhuman capabilities.<br><br>OOC: Feel free to jump in with anybody. Helen's not a militant Summoner, so she'll happily side with almost anybody.</div></div>

He didn't suppose he'd ingested anything that might cause him to start seeing random orbs of light spinning around the fingers of beautiful women.<br><br>Stopped. Thought about that one. She <i>was</i> pretty good, he had to admit. Something a little proud in the face, but he liked a girl with an ego. Well, why not. It'd pass a few minutes at least.<br><br>"Waiter? I'll have another one." He thought for a moment. "Two, actually."<br><br><div align="center"><img style="max-width: 100%;" src="http://i322.photobucket.com/albums/nn433/asgardreid/TerrianBrogue-1.png"></div><br><br>* * *<br><br>Therefore two dashing, attractive, completely identical young men approached Helen's table at the same time. Each of them was carrying a glass of red wine.<br><br>One of them pulled out a chair. The second one sat down. The first one sat down, too.<br><br>There was now one dashing, attractive young man sitting across from Helen and holding a glass of red wine in each hand.<br><br>"Care for a drink?"</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">OOC: Pokemon are never requisite (even in PRP.), though use of them is permitted in all Pokeschool forums.<br><br>And indeed, this week is THE GREATEST WEEK IN TEH HISTARY OF TEH EXODUS. Al, Red, DL, and BB all return, Photu begins RPing, Mafia begins, Loogs posts In A Moment, etcetera, etcetera. This is just plain awesome.<br><br>BIC: Helen smiled. "I think I've been drinking enough, considering that I'm seeing double on occasion." She tipped back her hat, and grinned slightly. "Really, I think that would be rather nice." She accepted the drink with obvious gratitude. "Thanks, fella." She took a sip.<br><br>"Good stuff." Helen snapped her fingers with her free hand, the ball deciding to orbit the crown of her hat instead. She drummed her fingers on the table, looking over her shoulder momentarilly before turning back towards him. "So, what brings you around these parts?"</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Beelzebibble</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">The first word that popped into his mind was "Recuperation". He wouldn't say that, of course. Couldn't mention Channery. The whole on-the-rebound approach was not, he knew quite well, the way to make a strong impression. <br><br>He decided, instead, to give her both his best charming-mysterious smile and a smaller truth. Fortunately for him, there was still a superb elephant sitting in this particular metaphorical living room. "Around Olivine? Boring story. Around to your table? Well, you tell me." He gestured at the ball of light still revolving lazily around her hat. "Nice trick. Tell me how it's done? Or are you a performer?"</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Well, I guess you could say... Both. I'm a magician, both stage and real. I can cast pretty much any basic spell, but they've always bored me, so I try to find some challenging and unique methods for doing things." She smiled, and shrugged. "I'm waiting for people to show up that I have a feeling will be coming. I've got a little bit of an errand to run, and their help could come in handy." Helen took a liberal sip of her drink. "It's a nice day out, don't you think?"</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Beelzebibble</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Terrian wouldn't be deterred. "What kind of people? What errand? I only ask because I think I can help you. I don't know if it's some kind of magic or just a special power, but..."<br><br>He stood up again. He did this seven more times. There were now eight dashing, attractive, completely identical young men standing around the one dashing, attractive young man who still sat at Helen's table.<br><br>"...I could be persuaded to lend a few hands to your venture. Name's Terrian Brogue, by the way."</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">prime</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Prime teleported in behind Helen, and raised an eyebrow at the 8 men across the table from him. "That's a neat trick." He said, honestly wishing he could do that. "Sadly, if I tried, everything around me would probably blow up." He stretched, then looked at Helen, and at the ring of light above her head. "You called? Normally I wouldn't respond to such a summon, but Aurora is missing, and I'm rather bored."</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Impressive indeed." Helen agreed. "My name's Helen Mercury, pleased to make your acquaintance. All of you." She offered a hand in greeting, standing up and stepping towards the seated Terrian.<br><br>"My task that lies ahead of me is rather difficult, I suppose. I need to procure a tome on a school of magic from a magical research center, and since they were unwilling to give me any more information than that it was something new, and 'If you're so interested in a new school of magic, make yer own damn forbidden arts.' to quote, I believe that I may need to acquire it by force."<br><br>"I'd rather not kill anybody, or even really hurt them. You know. In and out, grab the book and run. They may be magicians, but I think they'd have the courtesy not to curse my soul out of existance if I return the book once I finish learning from it." Helen said with a disturbing lightness in her tone. "Besides, they're mainly just scholars, not combat casters, so I don't think they'll try anything TOO lethal."</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Beelzebibble</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Terrian stood up. "You've got my attention, Miss Mercury. Covert infiltrations are just my style. I find they go much smoother when you can break into six floors at the same time." His duplicates nodded mischeviously, then stepped back to merge into Terrian. "But do you foresee any possible... side benefits for someone who isn't really the spellbook type?"<br><br>He turned to the new arrival. Presumably one of the people Mercury had been waiting for, considering the way he'd addressed her. "Nice to meet you, too. I'm Terrian Brogue. I take it you two know each other?"</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">prime</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Prime laughed, the ground around him rippling with his ambient energy. His eye's glowed briefly as he lost control of his power for a moment, then he brought it back under control. "Never underestimate a scholor Helen." He said, avoiding her hand with practiced ease. He gave her an apologetic look. "Sorry, hazard of overwhelming power. I wouldn't want to make your hand dissapear off to some alternate reality." Prime said. "Now, as for the scholars. People like that generally have guards, and lots of them, not including a great deal of nasty magical traps that will mostly likely be entirely unknown to either of you." He said, holding out his hand. "I, however, bend reality itself to my will. So most likely any kind of magical trap cast at me will be ineffective. My current form is composed of energy, they'd need a great deal to disrupt it. So I suggest, for the moment at least, that you allow me to be your tank. Its unlikely anything that have will prove effective against me. Unless death herself is working for him of corse." He grinned. "So when do we leave?"<br><br>He turned to look at Terrian. "Sadly no, I don't really know this woman. I'm just board, and when you meet so many new people, you learn to deal with things. Especially when you have my abilities." He looked at Terrians aura, at his soul, and grinned. "Your a promising prospect, I hope to see more of you in the future. Full to the brim with hope and confidence." He said, holding back his tongue. Prime didn't have the heart to tell him what the world was truely like, when you crossed over to the other side.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Well, I have no idea on that one. I was told that they research magical gear, attempting to reverse engineer lost magicks and other such things. They might have something juicy, though I'm also betting they've got a lot of cursed stuff you'd rather not touch. Pants of mystic castration and that sort of deal." <br><br>"Actually, Prime and I go back quite a bit. We tend to run into eachother during earthshaking cataclysms and the like. Don't get much of a chance to talk... For some reason. So I guess that'd explain his failure to recognize me." Helen said with a note of mock curiosity. She reached into her pocket, and produced a sheet of green paper. One side was a flier for a local library, but the other had apparently had notes scribbled on it.<br><br>"The Parmigianino Institute is located in the swamps of Lousiana. They believe in taking a scientific approach towards magic and mysticism, analyzing it to see what makes it tick. Their ideal goal is a world that accepts magic as just another fact, a sort of law of physics that counteracts the other laws one could say. They have several large brick buildings, not too odd to look at at first, until you realize that they're magically suspended over the swamps. Otherwise, from my examination of the buildings, and the data they've released, I can't tell much more. I wanted to ask my... Tutor? Sensei? Teacher? Whatever. Abatis about them, but he said that it would be best for me if I started learning for myself."<br><br>"I guess that unless we have any more questions, we're about ready to head out." Helen snapped her fingers, her clothes instantly exploding into another outfit. She now was in her stage outfit, enormous pink tophat resting atop her purple locks. She wore purple dress that barely reached the tops of her thighs, and bright pink tights that seemed almost to glow with their luminosity. A pair of small, businesslike slippers completed the ensemble. "I think I'm about ready."<br><br>OOC: Magic is a great equalizer, ladies and gents. And I think that I've got plans to make sure we're all pretty even contributors here.<br><br>And I'm not sure if Helen ever really met Prime... I think that she's been a background character in a few topics with him, though they never met. If it involves Miko, Helen is usually mentioned somewhere subtle.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"I'm good to go when you guys are. How are we getting to Louisiana? Teleportation?" That last word was spoken in a tone halfway between genuine curiousity and incredulity. Terrian was learning a lot of new things, these past few minutes, and the part that bothered him was that he actually sort of believed them. <br><br>Well, there was also the part where it seemed he was the only one learning new things. That bothered him too. Still. There had to be a stupid one in every group.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">prime</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Prime grinned. "No, I believe I can effect a manner of transport more comfortable to you." He said, turning his gaze towards the street. He raised his hand, and reality began to twist before him. The features beyond him ran and twisted, no longer certain, and then Prime reached out and brought another point of space to himself. A vertical slash opened in reality, showing a marsh through the other side, edges of ragged energy flapping wildly. "Make sure you don't touch the edges of the portal." Prime said, "You could end up loosing an arm if your not careful."</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Beelzebibble</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Terrian looked at the gash. He then looked at Helen. He then smiled again, this time as innocently as he could muster. "Ladies first."</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Helen tapped on the brim of her hat a few times, and straightened it. She inhaled deeply. "Here we go, guys. Don't attack until we have to." She stepped through the portal, energy crackling around her momentarily. She landed on the roof of one of the buildings, a small service shed. All of the buildings had no windows or doors, apparently relying on the mystic abilities of those present to make an entry.<br><br>There was the sound of a passing gust of wind, and a small, fragile man appeared. "So, what is this we have here?" The scholar asked, his delicate robes making him an obvious mage. "Sometimes it pays to scry around."</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">XYZ</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">A loud cry was heard as a figure dressed in black was thrown from the portal, landing face down on the building. Moaning in pain the man picked himself up and rubbed his cheek.<br><br>"With Ninja-like subtlety our hero makes his way on to the rooftop...." Damien said self-mockingly to nobody in particular "..Ouch." Just then he looked down and noticed that his toes were sticking out through the end of his boots. "Ugh, reality defying portals suck." He said wiggling his toes.<br><br>As he looked up, and saw Helen, his face turned a vibrant shade of red, perhaps he should have stayed at home.<br><br>"I followed the umm magicallyness. I'm not retarded, I swear, I came to help out.....I guess."<br><br>OOC: Yeah....random....sweet.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Beelzebibble</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Terrian stepped through the portal and immediately fell several feet onto the rooftop. His reflexes had already responded to create several duplicates by the time he hit the surface. They rubbed their bruises and grumbled as they merged back into Terrian.<br><br>"Off to a good start," he said, grinning wryly. "No windows, no doors... How am I supposed to infiltrate this? And do the--"<br><br>He was about to finish that sentence with "--researchers get <i>any</i> sunlight at all?", but he trailed off as he noticed their new companion. So he was about to introduce himself and ask the fellow's name, but then he noticed the small, fragile man, and he decided that perhaps he might just want to shut up at that particular moment.<br><br><br><i>OOC: Was that right? Is the small, fragile man a new character? The way you wrote it, Lee, I wasn't sure whether that was the case or whether Helen had magically disguised herself. If the latter is true, pretend that Terrian is just surprised at Helen's transformation... I guess.<br><br>No, I'm not terribly good at this.</i></div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">ch00beh</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Unlike the previous incursion, another figure casually sauntered through the gash.<br><br>"I'm not 100% why I decided to check out this portal. Probably bored or something," Rie muttered to no one in particular.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">prime</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">OOC: Actually, your doing well. Your not suppost to write from Lee's perspective, but from your characters own perspective. If your charrie thinks that Helen is now a fragile man, then thats what you SHOULD write. It adds depth to your post, and gives us something more interesting to process. As well as a way to, possible, have more fun with you ^^.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">XYZ</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">OOC: All the same I believe that the old man is an NPC character if you like. He's our first challenge before entering the building. =P</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">OOC: Yup, NPC of sorts. Though I'm not above adopting NPCs who worked well enough and had unique flavor (Tsubota, Monaco, Pablo).<br><br>BIC: The man glared at the group, his palms glowing with arcane energy. "I am not the type for violent behavior. I personally prefer more reserved, peaceful methods of conflict resolution. I know that the woman with you, Helen Mercury, is trying to obtain an experimental school of magic. However, instead of applying for the right to join this organization, she has chosen to try to obtain it in some other manner."<br><br>"I'm going to ask you all once. Are you here to bargain, or here to fight?" The man glared at the people, his gaze piercing and full of wisdom.<br><br>"Well, I think that depends on the kind of bargain you want to strike." Helen said, cracking her knuckles. "How about we don't fight if you just let me borrow the tome?"<br><br>"Inacceptable. And with that threat, you give me authorization to begin triggering our defenses. Descent to hell!" The man's voice rose, clapping his hands for emphasis. The building that they were on dropped sharply, hitting the swamp below. It began to sink below the surface.<br><br>"I'd advise you all to relocate swiftly. These swamps can turn one into mindless undead if they aren't warded appropriately." The man gloated from his spot in the sky, focusing more energy in the palms of his hands. Helen removed her hat, producing a rose. She threw it into the air.<br><br>"Blossom so slight,<br>Pray now, give me flight!"<br><br>The rose dissolved in a cloud of sparks, Helen immediately rising into the air. She realized that in her rush, she had forgotten to protect her allies. Turning her back on the mage, she began rummaging through her hat for important components for another flight spell.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">A few seconds later Terrian was next to her.<br><br>He wasn't standing on air, though. There were several duplicates underneath him, each of them standing on the shoulders of the one below. They all gave Helen a serious look.<br><br>"You might consider helping me out--" said the original Terrian.<br><br>"--I'm not the type of guy you want becoming an undead--" warned the first duplicate.<br><br>"--zombie army in a matter of minutes--" elaborated the second.<br><br>"--could get ugly, is all I mean to say," advised the third.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Prime stepped through the portal, and fell suddenly several feet to the top of the building. "What the hell?" He said, landing with a thud. His leg's were numb now, he hadn't been expecting them. "Hmmmmm." He voiced, "Judging from the current rate of sink, I believe one of those traps I was talking about went off?" He asked, just a little irritated. White tendrils of energy flowed out from his feet, slowly engulfing the building. He lifted it back up to its proper position, and then turned his eye's to the arcane scholar in the sky. "I assume you had some kind of self justifying speech before this started." Prime said mildly, "Care to repeat it?"</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Rie quickly jumped into the air. Her body suddenly mutated and morphed around itself, reshaping itself from the previous humanoid form into a more practical eagle form. The unnaturally white eagle flapped its wings to stay in the air then flew towards Helen. Rie simply circled above the mage, waiting, unable to communcate or do anything else while in animal form.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Accursed beings! The man began working himself into a fervor, mumbling under his breath. He had to somehow stifle the energy-being, limit him. He was far too powerful to let him roam free. "I will repeat something, but I believe you already know what manner of repetition it is that I pursue."<br><br>The man produced a pouch of dust, and threw the bag into the murky waters. Moments later, Prime's reflection began to move independently, refusing to follow him. It soon sneered maliciously, bursting free from the water with energy lancing all about. The scholar snickered. "He may be only a temporary clone, but I assure you, his time will be trying for all of you."</div></div>

        <h2 class="poster">prime</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Prime scowled. "Shit, its a reality infraction. I HATE reality infractions!" He spat, looking at the clone that was not a clone, but a version of Prime from an alternate reality. It only had an impression of what it was suppost to do, now that it'd been summoned. And that was...kill. Prime cursed, "Everyone get down!" He yelled, the other Prime was already building some seriously armageddon type energies around himself. Prime locked his tendrils of energy in place, keeping the building above the water, and walked off the edge into open air, heading for his copy. "What weakness in myself lies in you." He muttered. Copy Prime lashed out, unimaginable energy's breaking over shields that suddenly flashed around Prime's body. "This could take a while..."<br><br>He turned towards the others for a moment, power still lashing out and breaking over his shields. "Get in the building, this is shortly going to get to heated for me to defend you. One of these buildings should be able to protect you, they're displaced from reality." He yelled, then turned back to deal with his alternate. He held out his hand, eye's briefly shining white, and then the world around him erupted in a concussive blast of nuclear magnitude.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Rie dropped back into her human shape above the building. She tucked herself into a tight roll to disperse the falling energy when she hit the platform. Untucking, Rie caught a glimpse of the real Prime confronting the clone. "This could be bad," she muttered monotonously, and shortly thereafter, the two reality shifters blew up.<br><br>Simply on instinct, Rie shifted into a parallel reality. Her ethereal form, barely visible to the naked eye, stayed in the current reality, keeping her mind anchored to its home. The two Primes would only be from two different planes of existence, so she wouldn't be hit by the blast wave, unless she accidentaly hit the Prime' (hehe, Prime prime) reality, which was a one in infinity chance.<br><br>Just as she hoped, the shockwave washed over her, merely giving her an uncomfortable tingly feeling. Matter and energy were only contained in their plane of origin. Magic, on the other hand, was not. Rie shifted back to her home reality, but didn't get any closer to the battle.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Terrian!" Helen shouted, realizing how vulnerable her newfound friend was. Unlike the others, he hadn't shown superhuman resistance to damage or evasive capacities. And she didn't know if he was one of those people who put their life force into their clones. If one of them got injured, it might be really bad for him. She drew a dagger from a concealed pocket on the back of her dress, and clutched it before her.<br><br>"Cold, keen edged knife,<br>One moment of life!"<br><br>The dagger dissolved, and instantly, shields formed around her and her vulnerable allies. The shields took a beating, but managed to maintain at least long enough to block the first nasty explosion.<br><br>"We've got to get inside!" Helen dove down, dismissing her spell and hitting the roof, hard. She staggered to her feet, fumbling for another spell component. As she produced a piece of wool, a lance of flame burnt the material from her hands. Helen panicked and stepped back, dropping the smoldering remnants.<br><br>"You forget that Prime' is not the only threat here." The scholar's eyes turned orange as he began readying another spell.<br><br>"I feel low for doing this, but... Blades of the gods' wrath, dance across the earth! Lightning!" Helen chanted, a thunderbolt crashing down before the man and singing him. It was a powerful spell, but Helen's inexperience with the more common forms of magic showed. The man grinned back at her.<br><br>"Weakling! You should learn the basics if you hope to be great!" The man turned his side to them, extending his right hand. "Stellar Scattershot." Instantly, dozens of small balls of energy began rocketing from the man's hands, exploding on whatever they hit with a considerable ammount of force. Helen fell to the ground, covering her head as the attack battered her relentlessly.</div></div>

"Looks like I'm not your man," he told the mage.<br><br>Yet the original Terrian buckled slightly and wheezed. "But I get a taste of the pain instead," he said, still at a barely-audible volume. "Look, I'm going to be useless until I get my hands on a few weapons. How exactly are we getting inside? Are we going to have to ask this guy politely, or what? Somehow I don't think killing him is going to help us."</div></div>

The fake went flying, creating a large, rapidly lengthening line in the earth, through water and stone as well. As soon as Prime was sure he was far enough away, he teleported in beside Helen. "Here!" He said quickly to Terrian, holding out his hands, two rods slowly materialised below them, imbedded in the stone of the building. "Just say what you want them to be, and that's what they'll become." He said, then held his palm towards the stone, trying to force the bonds aside. He scowled for a moment, sweat breaking out over his face. "Shit. Its to strong." He whipped his hand towards the old man up in the sky, four tendrils of white energy wrapping themselves around him, and threw his down into the building. The stone opened like clay, and the old man passed harmlessly through. "Follow him, now! I can't afford to have you out here!"</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Helen plunged through the gaping hole in the building, following the man. She crashed into a crate, bouncing sideways and landing on her posterior. The crate tipped over, and thousands of tiny, marble-like objects went clattering across the floor of the storeroom. Helen stopped, watching as they rolled across the floor and dispersed. She went to turn towards the man, and felt some thin, weak hands seizing her wrists. A handcuff like object was latched around her wrist. She spun to punch the man, but he levitated, absorbing the blow with little damage.<br><br>"You have now been bound with a band of restriction. You won't be able to use magic until you manage to work it off." The man turned to leave, as the roof began to seal and darken the room. "One other thing, lady and your company... Those are spell beads, magic that instantly triggers the moment you touch them. Some are healing spells, some are offensive spells... Some just outright do something peculiar. You may want to watch where you step."<br><br>The man pointed at the door, a magic glow surrounding it. The moment he stepped outside and closed the door, it began creeping across the wall, sliding along as if it were being moved. Helen swore silently to herself as the door relocated itself, and the roof finished sealing. Hopefully, some of the others had managed to get in before it closed.</div></div>

She fiddled with it a little, and the light snapped on, blinding her momentarilly. As her eyes adjusted, the form of the door became much more apparent.

It contained a substantial ammount of popcorn, popped long ago and now stale and unpleasant to the touch.<br><br>She ripped the bag open, and threw its contents helter-skelter, like some manner of confetti. Most spells triggered went off with little protest, simply hissing slightly or going out in sparks. Helen strode forward, reasonably sure that she could reach the door like this, when disaster struck. A volatile spell, triggered by Helen's ministrations, exploded in a screaming wall of icy wind. The spheres were sent careening into the walls, exploding violently as they struck. As Helen caught herself, having tumbled wildly when the storm had first occured, she noticed that it was not fading. The windstorm had formed into a miniature tornado, wildly twisting around the room as if it was guarding the door. Most of the spheres had been dealt with, but this could prove to be even more trouble...</div></div>

He had a reflective look for moment, then shrugged. "Sorry, just wondering what anyone else thinks of me, seeing as I've just called myself an asshole." He shrugged, than looked at the tornado.

Realizing how vague she sounded, she added, "I mean that it moves on its own. The geezer ain't controlling it.

She looked toward Prime, Rie, Terrian and Damien.<br><br>"We have to either take this S.O.B. down, or get through hurricane force winds.

It balled up for a second, and then rose again, still composed of an almost opaque wind, now shaped like a rough humanoid figure. It spoke with the voice of the breeze in reeds, a hurricane ripping through a marsh, desolate wind on the mountainside.<br><br>"Who dares to pass?" The wind elemental querried.<br><br>"We do."

Blaise charged, swinging her peculiar dagger at Helen. The magician brought her sword to bear, but the blade cleaved through it, cutting across Helen's left arm.

I rule. <i>Why</i> am I not king?"<br><br>"Listen," said the duplicate. "Our guns have been totalled, so now we're pretty much powerless against anything that can't just be mobbed to death. This is not a time to be patting ourselves on the back."<br><br>Terrian stopped tangoing with an invisible partner and considered this. "You're right." He looked through the hole. "And that isn't an arsenal. Why is it I keep having to jump through holes and I never even get an arsenal?"<br><br>He turned back to his duplicate. "Well, I guess that means I won't be needing you until we can find some weapons. Come here, you."<br><br>He took his duplicate by the hand, and in another second, the singular Terrian Brogue stepped through the hole and looked admiringly around at the library.<br><br><br><i>OOC - Are we going to get any clues in here about what exactly "Rebellious Orator" is?</i></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Helen rolled over, and weakly pushed herself to her feet. Both of her arms were bleeding pretty badly. It wasn't severe, but she'd need to patch them up before going on. She glanced around the room, and noticed an ornate scribing table, decked out in the standard blue and silver. That'd work just fine. Staggering slightly, the magician rested her hands on the desk.<br><br>"Desk, piece by piece,<br>My bleeding cease." Helen incanted, the desk dissolving in a cloud of shimmering lights. She turned to face the group again.<br><br>"Well, I believe that my journey is almost at an end here. This is the central library, holding all of the research that they've ever done. Countless styles of magic, all exposed for the taking, if one can break through the enchantments. Of course, raw magical might tends to beget thirst for more, and they tend to wreck up places, so instead of making a simple disenchanting practice, they use puzzles." Helen said with the air of a tourguide, as she guided them through the library. Soon enough, they had arrived at the research section. Helen reached into her pocket, and produced a dessicated piece of grass.<br><br>"I feel cheap using such a hackneyed rhyme, but the show must go on.<br>Bit of hay,<br>Point the way!" Helen disintergrated the blade, and instantly, a large glow came from a nearby glass case. The case was stationed on top of a stout marble column, and within it appeared to be a small scroll, made of soft, pale leather. She snapped her fingers, dismissing the glow, and revealing a brass plate on the case.<br><br>"Contained within is the secret of the Rebellious Orator school of magic. To release the case, one must make a libation to Calliope." Helen read aloud from the plate. She turned on looked at the others, quizzical expression etched in every feature. "Who the hell is Calliope?"</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"A constellation?" Terrian suggested vaguely. He had found an elaborately pencilled map of the building tacked to the wall and was now engaged in studying it closely at the expense of taking in what Helen had just seen. A room marked with the images of a sword and a gun was just down the hall from the library. Was it an arsenal? Was he to complete his minor sidequest this day?<br><br>He turned around and walked back to the group while also remaining in front of the map at the wall. <br><br>"I'm sending him out to secure the area," the Terrian who had walked to the group said, gesturing toward his duplicate. "He will be weaponless, defenseless, and at constant risk of detection by this building's staff, but I have no doubt that his natural ingenuity will serve to keep him safe while he makes a quick check of the floor."<br><br>"Aw, g'wan," his duplicate said, pretending to blush. With a cheery wave, he departed through the periwinkle-colored door.<br><br>"Now then!" Terrian continued, after his duplicate had gone. "I hate to give such an obvious answer, especially if it turns out to be wrong, but do you think we might find a reference to Calliope somewhere among these books?" He stared up at the colossal silver shelves around them. "That's assuming we can open them without any danger to ourselves."</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Most of the books here have no wards, and are simple basic magic theory and fact. Magicians are generally lazy, and dislike having to disenchant every book before reading it. Calliope does sound like it'd be a constellation, so mayhaps I should check some of the astronomy books." Helen said, dashing away from the pillar. A few moments later, she came back to the section of the library, toting a massive volume. "Lists every constellation known to man. And some that aren't. This might help us a little."</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message"><i>OOC - Time to reveal another minor sub-power falling within Terrian's duplication ability -- the power to communicate with his duplicates by thought! I didn't think I'd unveil this one so early on, but I have no objection. (The power to call any duplicate to his side was first seen in Enma.)</i><br><br><br>The duplicate Brogue strode purposefully down the hall, staring at the floor. He knew that this would be less likely to draw attention than attempting an innocuous saunter. He would have liked to be fiddling significantly with something, but he had nothing with him except the clothes he wore. After walking a distance that had looked shorter on paper, he came to a door marked with the same sword-and-gun symbol from the map.<br><br><i>I found it,</i> he thought.<br><br>* * *<br><br>And the original Terrian, standing with the others in the library, thought, <i>Good. Let me know whenever you want me to pull you back.</i><br><br>* * *<br><br>Hoping he wasn't about to trigger any alarms, the duplicate Brogue gently put one hand on the doorknob. <br><br>Nothing happened. He carefully opened the door enough to see through into the room. Then he pulled the door all the way open and stepped through.<br><br>There was no one in the room as far as he could tell, but there were certainly a lot of potential hiding places. The arsenal was filled with metal racks carrying virtually every type of weapon conceivable -- and a few he had honestly not conceived of before this moment. Primitive spears and clubs shared shelves with elaborately constructed rifles that looked as though they had come from the future and shot, he had no doubt, lasers. The walls were lined with maces, bayonets, crossbows, and at least one harpoon gun; the ceiling, he noted with some unease, was bedecked with hanging swords. <br><br>Something red on a far shelf caught his eye -- the room was dominated by shades of brown, silver and black -- and he went to it. It was an ornately designed case that displayed six perfectly ordinary handguns. Vaguely disappointed, Brogue was halfway through turning to look at a tomahawk when it occurred to him that the Parmigianino Institute probably wasn't in the habit of holding on to perfectly ordinary weaponry. He turned back to the case and, just to satisfy his curiousity, read the card propped up next to it.<br><br><i>‚ÄúNamed after a famous style of rapier used by wizard hunters in the sixteenth century, the Mage Masher has a simple yet powerful ability. This gun is designed to fire standard 9mm bullets such as are produced throughout the world. However, if fired from a Mage Masher, a bullet‚Äôs trajectory is immune to magical intervention. It can pass through otherwise impervious force fields, and it cannot be telekinetically diverted from its course. In all other respects (including its power to penetrate physical barriers such as armor), the bullet will perform as though it had been shot from a standard gun.‚Äù</i><br><br>"Huh," Brogue said aloud, and then tensed: It was the first thing he had said since entering the room, and he fully expected a sound-activated alarm to trigger. When no such alarm went off, he resumed his inspection of the six guns. <br><br>They just sat there looking ordinary. He didn't think it unreasonable to argue that they looked precisely as ordinary now that he had read their description as they had before.<br><br>He picked one up and turned it over in his hands to see if it would feel unusual. He regretted this immediately.<br><br>As soon as he had plucked the gun from the case, the case began to swell. The other five guns also began to swell. So, too, did the card beside the case, and the tomahawk nearby. In fact, everything in the room, except for Brogue and the single Mage Masher in his hands, was now growing. He looked around him in shock as the brimming shelves of weapons steadily slid away from him as they grew taller; the swords on the ceiling were steadily moving upward as they grew longer.<br><br>Brogue stuffed the Mage Masher into his pocket and ran back across the floor. The shelves had now gained nearly half their original size. The door was up ahead, but it too was growing; the doorknob was twice as far up as before and had grown to the size of a disco ball.<br><br>Brogue took a running start, leaped, and grabbed onto the doorknob with both hands. It was still increasing in size, and already his grip on it was slipping, though he had both arms firmly wrapped around it. And the floor was dropping ever further away by the second.<br><br>He swung his legs to the right, then used the momentum to swing his whole body to the left. The doorknob turned slightly and then righted itself. He swung again, even further. The doorknob turned more but again righted itself. He swung once more, and this time the doorknob turned all the way, and the door opened outward onto the hall beyond. But it was now impossible to hang on to the doorknob any longer, and with a cry Brogue lost his hold and plummeted to the floor so far below him...<br><br>...only to land on his hands and knees, having fallen a distance of perhaps three feet. <br><br>The door shut itself behind him, and he saw now that it was a perfectly ordinary door, just as perfectly ordinary-looking as the gun in his pocket.<br><br>But there were people running to him from both ends of the hall, pointing, shouting, and he panicked for a good two seconds before realizing, for the first time since he had noticed the Mage Mashers, that Terrian was just waiting for the signal.<br><br><i>Now!</i> he thought.<br><br>* * *<br><br>The original Terrian Brogue heard his duplicate's call and quickly slipped away into another aisle of books, leaving Helen, Rie and the others gathered around the Rebellious Orator book. Once he was out of sight of them, he muttered, <i>"To me!"</i><br><br>The duplicate appeared by his side at once.<br><br>"What'd you find?"<br><br>"This." The duplicate pulled out a gun. "It's called a Mage Masher. Fires totally normal bullets, but those bullets can pass through any magical protection. I figured it might come in handy."<br><br>"Not bad!" The original Terrian took the gun and examined it. "That's it, though?"<br><br>"Yeah. Once I picked that up, I must have set something off, because the whole room started growing. By the time I remembered you could teleport me out, I had already made a daring escape and been surrounded by angry scientists."<br><br>"I wouldn't expect any less of you," the original Terrian said, patting his duplicate on the back. "Good work, my friend."<br><br>He stepped forward, and the duplicate did as well. In another moment they were one again.<br><br>Immediately Terrian could remember all the events in the arsenal as though he personally had been there. But of course, in a way, he had.<br><br>He pocketed the Mage Masher and rejoined the others. "My duplicate, despite carrying himself with all the skill and dignity I gave him, inadvertently let the scientists know where he was. They're probably checking out the arsenal right now, but I don't doubt they'll stop in at the other rooms on this floor. So we should probably clear out of here before long." He looked back at the Rebellious Orator book. "Anyone else figure out the libation thing?"<br><br><br><i>OOC - Whoof! I</i> can <i>get wordy with the RPs, can't I? All the same, I quite enjoyed that scene with Terrian's duplicate. I hope further adventures offer other opportunities to see his duplicates when they're on their own missions, not taking direct orders from him. By the way, to whom it may concern, the name "Mage Masher" comes from a recurring weapon in Final Fantasy games, which does indeed take the form of a rapier or knife.</i><br><br><br><br></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">OOC: This actually inspired me to give Blaise another chance‚Ä¶ We‚Äôll see how it goes after I finish this. Also, here‚Äôs Prime‚Äôs post to cover the whole of the RP while he was gone. (This all is part 1 of the ending. Part 2 will be the poem, which I'm composing right now.)<br><br>BIC: (Prime)<br>Prime watched the hole close behind his companions, and set a small part of his consciousness to watch and help them along, then turned to the other Prime. He was charging another shot, strings of light webbing outwards and twisting from between his hands. His figure was almost totally luminescent, and reality rippled like water upon the ground below him, which was further exaggerated by the muddy, bog-like terrain. "For sake of simplicity, I think I'll call you Primus. 'Other Me' is somewhat tedious." Prime said, heaving a deep sigh. Primus raised his hands above his head, and flung the energy at Prime. The white energy, growing and collapsing like some ghost of an ethereal star, whisked across the intervening distance. Prime raised his hand, a slightly transparent white barrier of energy forming between himself and the attack. It slammed violently against the shield, sparking out in every direction and laying gouges in ithe earth, before finally sputtering out and dying against the shield.<br><br>Prime flashed into existence behind Primus, who turned only quickly enough to see the blazing white punch that barreled into his jaw. The man went flying, only to have Prime appear in his path and hit him again, and again, and repeatedly until Primus literally exploded with energy to get the attacks to stop. They both hovered, looking each other over. Neither of them had taken any real damage, most of it had simply been shrugged off. Prime thought the matter over furiously, worried about his companions, and the planet as well. At this rate, neither of the two would last. That old man really had no idea what he'd done. He had to change the location, Primus was still evaluating. <br><br>A violet spark appeared above Prime's index finger, slowly, he hovered down to touch the ground with it. A black hole appeared in the earth, rimmed with shimmering violet energy. The hole rapidly expanded from Prime's finger to cover and area of half a mile, then suddenly stopped. "We don't belong here." Prime said, and the newborn portal suddenly shot upwards, taking both incarnations of Prime to a different place. They reappeared standing on the flat golden neutronium core of Jupiter, a completely uniform surface from horizon to horizon, even larger than Earth. The 'air' was filled with hazy brown and red dusts, no light intruded from the sun, only the feint pre-fusion glow from Jupiter's core below them.<br><br>Time to let loose. Prime thought, looking at his opposite. It suddenly seemed to realize it wasn't a distraction anymore, and suddenly it seemed as though a white hot sun was coming over the opposite horizon. Prime emulated him, bringing the full brunt of his power into effect. For this battle, nothing in reality would be certain anymore, the power they were putting out was already igniting the fusion reaction dormant in Jupiter. A white lance crossed between the two opposites, seeming to impale each other. It flashed out, and a star-field of white explosions followed it. The white glows that were Prime and Primus flashed in and out of existence, and moved rapidly across the Neutronium battlefield.<br><br>The light tripled when the two glows met, anyone capable of looking seeing only the blurred outlines of two human figures weaving a storm of unnatural steel around them. Their display was unrivaled, moving beyond what humans were capable of seeing, or comprehending. Their attacks moved through unknown layers of reality, and even broke it in places. Black dots floated among the huge white aura's, marking the places where the universe had died. When the broke apart, white lances blazed across the battlefield once more, trying to pin each other down and bring down his opposite.<br><br>The aftermath of the focused attacks started to blow away chunks of the neutronium core, and huge sections of Jupiter's gasses were expelled violently into space. The shock-waves from physical attacks were so intense, they created giant new storms on Jupiter's surface that flickered in and out of existence. Some of them even reached out high enough to swallow one of Jupiter's moons. The burning moon, Io, slowly descended to smash into Jupiter's center, right on top of the two Prime's. They ignored it, kicking pools of molten lava towards each other as distractions, only to reappear behind the other to slam their opponent viciously into a volcanoes side.<br><br>The fusion reaction ignited in earnest around them, and spread out quickly from Jupiter's core. The unbalance of Io's fall caused the other moons to be swallowed, one by one. The growing mass and pressure allowed the reaction to continue in earnest. Prime fought on amidst a fire even Hector would fear. The aftermath of the white lances the two generated blew clear holes into the swirling plasma around them, creating a complete vacuum, before the plasma rushed back in and creation a type of fission thunder, arcing outwards in unimaginably huge red lances dangerous even to the two Primes. Primus came away from the first unexpected lance with a blazing red mark on his shoulder.<br><br>Prime appeared behind him with a neutronium sword, and focused a limitless amount of energy into his attack. The cleaving down-stroke cut the neutronium core of the planet in half, but only severed Primus' hand, which quickly regrew. With a vicious punch to Prime's jaw, the two teleported away. Jupiter churned and continued to burn in their wake, it glowed a blue, newborn star as it finished the startup of its nuclear fusion reaction. It was a pleasant, deep blue light, occasionally on earths night side, and occasionally hidden behind the sun. (Lee, I find the image of this way to romantic to put out myself.)<br><br>The two fought on, reappearing through tears in space into emptiness. No longer worrying about fallout, energy with the density of stars lashed out against the opposites, crashing over shields the size of oceans. Ripples in reality cause blazing white wormholes to open around them, taking them to different places at the battle raged on. The center of a violet nebula became their new battleground, huge swaths of a proto-system incinerated by their attacks, the central star blown into trillions of saparite pieces by one of Primus' sword strokes, literally blowing away like the flame of a candle.<br><br>As reality ripped in that system, they battled on through a tunneling wormhole once more, reappearing near the edge of a black hole. Time didn't slow for them, however. The gigantic black engine of destruction literally drew its edges away from them, as though afraid of their battle. A few minutes saw the reason why, as Prime was thrown into the wormhole, and sensed what was on the other side. From the otherside, a different dimension entirely, he drew the white hole energy to power one of his own attacks. The black wormhole flickered out, and died. A disk of white energy and incomprehensible size impacted itself into Primus' torso, before he kicks it upwards and away.<br><br>The attack exploded, creating an entire new nexus of wormholes leaving to billions of different places. They reappeared through one of these wormholes, above a planet full of summoners. It was an amazing, florescent site, and the entire planet summoned a shield as the two appeared, defending themselves from the fallout of the pairs attacks as they battled on. This occurence swung the battle dramatically in Primus' favor, as Prime wgethered attacks head on to protect the life on the planet, his spirit energy began to flicker, but his white aura still burned strong.<br><br>They dived through another wormhole, appearing near the center of the galaxy. Stars set so close together, even the pair could feel their collective heat. They bother entered meditative states with the stimulus of the billions of close, visible stars. The scenery was incredible, the two of them became so bright as to eclipse the nearest stars. Primus threw Prime entirely through a planet, he responded by teleporting behind him and shoulder checking him in the midsection. A massive wave of energy follow Primus, then another one appeared on his other side. The two exploded violently as they met on Primus' body, and the man's burning figure shot off through a star. Prime met him on the other side, delivering a vicious axe kick to the head. Primus' used the momentum to reverse elbow Prime in the side of the head, and sent him flying into a nearby star.<br><br>It exploded, supernova, several seconds later. The energy had only moments to even begin expanding, before it was consumed by Prime and Primus' auras, and directed full on at each other. The white, violet, green and azure streaks of super-energy fought against each other for supremacy as they were directed against eachother, before Primus' summoning spell finally expired, and he began to flicker. The beam of super energy struck him directly in the head, expelling him from this universe.<br><br>Prime's aura instantly flickered out, and he hung in space for a long moment, spent. He teleported back to earth, on top of the odd research building. He grinned slightly, "My life was like a flame eh?" He realized, he could feel it beginning to flicker out. He found the hole in the building, and forced it open, laborously following the trail his companions had left behind, and folding what remained of his power inward, to sustain his life. He ran across the two rods he'd made for the charming young man he'd recently met, and wondered vaguely why they'd been discarded. Picking them up between his fingers, he continued onwards, until he ran into his companions in a very confusing room.<br><br>"Hmmmm," Prime voiced, then recognized the surprised look of his companions. "Oh yeah sorry, I finished up a while ago." He said, "I assume someone has already tried the door I just came through? And basically all the other ones as well? Yeah..." He looked around at the numbers on all the doors. "You dropped these by the way," He said, handing the white steel rods to Terrian, "Has anyone tried something like Pi yet? Seems like the kind of code magical researchers would put on a magical 'trap'?" He suggested, "I mean, isn't this just kind of like magics version of a code keypad?" He asked Helen.<br>(Lee)<br>‚ÄúKind of, though not really. It‚Äôs more like a keypad than it is a key, since it requires a ritual. Of course, a password is far too simple and secure for them. Mages always have to go with some weird*** system of overcomplicated stuff.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúSorry, guys. Not much that can be‚Ä¶ Well, poured out. I don‚Äôt keep many liquids on hand. Not much useful rhymes with water, and oil or wine both have much easier counterparts to carry when it comes to coil and spine.‚Äù Helen shrugged, and then slammed shut a book on astronomy.<br><br>‚ÄúSince I‚Äôve got nothing to pour out, and I don‚Äôt feel like spilling any blood, we‚Äôre going to try something a little different, first. I guess that an offering to a muse would have to be‚Ä¶ A poem, right? Well, maybe I can do something along those lines.‚Äù Helen sat down, and put her head in her hands.<br><br>‚ÄúNot just a poem.‚Äù One of Terrian‚Äôs copies responded, appearing from behind a nearby bookshelf with a paperback in his hand. ‚ÄúShe was the muse of EPIC poetry, and was never without a stylus and a tablet.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúEasy enough.‚Äù Damien said, and jerked his thumb towards where Blaise had fallen, a short ways through the library away. ‚ÄúNevermind. Her ‚Äòtablet‚Äô went kaboom.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs still easy.‚Äù Prime said, his chest still heaving from the exertion of battling a foe truly matching him in caliber. He waved his hand, a ball of light forming beneath it and then dropping to the floor. As it hit with a thwap, motes of brilliance burst away from it, revealing a brand new notebook full of sheets of lined paper. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good enough, right?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúShould be. Since this is word magic, a word is a word. May as well be a laptop computer.‚Äù Helen muttered, massaging her temples.<br><br>‚ÄúGood luck getting me to cough one of those up for you.‚Äù Rie grumbled distantly, eyeing a chandelier suspiciously. <i>Never could be sure what was trustworthy with magic around‚Ä¶</i><br><br>‚ÄúGot your stylus, then.‚Äù Damien flipped a pencil to Terrian, who caught it between two fingers in a grab that was somewhere between a fumble and an expert catch.<br><br>‚ÄúWhat kind of boom can we expect if this doesn‚Äôt work right?‚Äù Prime asked raising a subtly glowing hand.<br><br>‚ÄúNot much of one. Moreso the destruction of that scroll if we try to move it without removing the wards.‚Äù Helen said, sinking lower in her seat.<br><br>‚ÄúHere.‚Äù Brogue said, picking up the notebook and walking by himself. Terrian handed his copy the pencil, and reflexively tucked it into the spine of the book. He then took a few steps, took a deep breath, and extended his hands over the case.<br><br><i>Hope you know what you‚Äôre doing. Not that it‚Äôll hurt, but blowing up might suck anyways.</i><br><br><i>Didn‚Äôt you hear the woman? There‚Äôs almost no risk to any of us. </i><br><br><i>You know as well as I do that attentiveness has never been our strong point.</i> The copy dropped the book on top of the glass, and it settled there noiselessly. Though there was no movement, it seemed almost as if the case throbbed in response. A warm glow surrounded it, evincing happiness, or at least an synthesized version of it.<br><br>‚ÄúWe good to roll?‚Äù Damien brushed some plaster from one of the walls off of his shoulder.<br><br>‚ÄúNot‚Ä¶ yet. It‚Äôs primed, but I think it needs that last component before we can really be safe trying to take it. A poem.‚Äù Helen straightened up, using both hands to lift her hat from where it had fallen over her eyes.<br><br>‚ÄúRoses are red, violets are blue-‚Äú Prime started.<br> <br>‚ÄúPlease hurry up, the mages are due.‚Äù Terrian finished.<br><br>‚ÄúHe has a point.‚Äù Damien said, wandering over to the nearest table between them and the direction they had come from, and kicking it over. ‚ÄúCover is always nice.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúI guess I‚Äôll give it a shot.‚Äù Helen stood up, and gently guided Terrian‚Äôs clone aside with her hand. She put both palms on top of the glass case, the glow growing to surround her. She closed her eyes, and began speaking.</div></div>
