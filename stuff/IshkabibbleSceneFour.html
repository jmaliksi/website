        <h2 class="poster">Beelzebibble</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message"><i>Monday the 16th<br>12:56 pm</i><br><br>Terrian counted off pairs of trees as the dark teal sedan made its way up the drive to the Hotel Ansonia. The trees arched over the path, forming a canopy made brilliantly green by the midday sun positioned overhead. Up ahead loomed the hotel itself, the facade all pure white Roman columns and domes, set about with flower patches that encircled the front entrance. The Ansonia’s design betrayed no humility about being doubtless the ritziest structure in Winstone – indeed, it almost seemed to challenge the ancient towers (one standing and one ruined) which were plainly visible to the north. The hotel’s <i>nouveau riche</i> flair threw into sharp contrast those old, Japanese-styled structures where Pokemon trainers still claimed a few mythical creatures had once dwelled.<br><br>“Not bad, huh?” Terrian asked, not to the three unconscious men in the back row, but to the man in the suicide seat who looked precisely identical to himself.<br><br>Alpha shrugged. “If that’s your taste.”<br><br>“Oh fine, be a hermit. I know you’d rather live in a six-by-six stone room in the Vatican and sleep on stacks of books. But <i>some</i> of us can appreciate the finer things in life, Alpha!”<br><br>“I can do equally well whatever you can.”<br><br>“Except take a joke, pal.” Terrian craned his neck to look through the rear-view mirror. “They’re still with us, right?”<br><br>“I see both Jonas and Rhys,” Alpha confirmed. Rie the albino mouse was perched on his shoulder, having apparently ruled out the lap as an acceptable resting spot.<br><br>“Good.” Terrian let the car gently down a slope into the Ansonia’s garage. “Because we’ve taken our first step into Chez Giarrettiera. We’re on Giarrettierritory. You like that one? Come on, it’s a portmanteau, you’re supposed to be all about this stuff.”<br><br>Alpha smiled, perhaps more out of duty than amusement, as the car rolled down out of the sunlight and into the belly of the beast.<br><br><br><br><div align="center"><font face="Braggadocio"><font size="7">ISHKABIBBLE</font><br><font size="6">SCENE FOUR</font></font><br><font face="Garamond"><font size="4">Once Again Rhys Finds Himself Somewhat Awkwardly in the Midst of Older Acquaintances</font></font></div><br><br><br><br>As far as bellies of the beast went, however, this one was pretty well done up. The walls of the garage were tiled in a vaguely aquatic mosaic pattern of blues and whites, and the golden light fixtures cast a pleasant hue over the shining rows of cars. This was a garage for people who thought hotwiring was a successful croquet move. Of course, the cameras which Terrian spotted tucked into corners of the ceiling were able to account for an otherwise apparent gap in security.<br><br>Terrian pulled into an empty space; as he got out, he saw Jonas and Rhys parking as well. He stooped to look back into the car, at Alpha and the three guys. They were still out for all he could tell.<br><br>“Keep an eye on them ‘til we come back, okay?” he told Alpha, who nodded and slung one arm over his leather seat. He rolled down the window briefly to let Rie hop onto the hood of the next car over. Terrian added, “And if the Don sends anyone down here to pick them up <i>without</i> me, let me know. Really hoping to keep everyone nice and content throughout this visit but, well, things happen.”<br><br>“They do tend to,” Alpha said.<br><br>Terrian smiled and shut the door to greet the others. “Alpha’s going to stay here and guard the boys,” he told them, keeping his voice low yet enjoying the echo in this space. “We’ll head upstairs and see if we can go say hi to the Don. Yeah?”</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Rie crawled up to the rolled down window and looked at the distance to the next car. Did they really expect her to make that in this body? She turned her mousey face to shoot Alpha a look, then leaped out the window anyway.<br><br>In midair, she had already started to transform. Her forelegs turned into miniature human arms, reaching out to grab at the car. Her entire body began swelling. As soon as her hands made contact with the car, she was a man-sized mouse with naked, human arms. The half creature pulled into a roll, hair shrinking into her body and getting replaced by clothes as she moved. <br><br>As a mouse, she didn't judge the distance very well. Rie ended up over-rolling the hood of the car and fell off the other side.<br><br>"Ow," she said passively as she stood up.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Rhys fiddled with the radio impassively, his eyes on Terrian's sedan at the front of their convoy. Now that he was no longer in imminent danger of being shot at, his mind played the events of the past hour or so over, trying desperately to make sense of them and succeeding little.<br><br>His day so far had consisted of a two-hour drive to Terrian's home, making the acquaintance of a very large man and a very dangerous woman, offering advice to a very frazzled Terrian, being held at gunpoint and then brawling with folks from the Mafia -- <i>the Mafia!</i> -- and pledging his assistance in smoothing over this matter with said Mafia higher-ups. And three glasses of brandy. All before lunch. He chortled at that last thought. <br><br>An awful lot of excitement that was for a journalist, Rhys mused, pulling into the Hotel Ansonia's rather cavernous luxury parking garage. It seemed to him that his life had gotten interesting ever since meeting Terrian at the Giguere Estate...Or was it before that?<br><br>The corner of his mouth quirked down in a reminiscent frown as his mind recalled the little slip of paper with the phone number in his wallet. Really, when he thought about it, his chance meeting with Miss Helen Mercury marked the end of the comparative monotony he had previously known.<br><br>Thinking of Helen made Rhys recall Terrian's word-fumbling earlier at the house (<i>earlier</i> -- probably all of half an hour ago, but it seemed like weeks already); he wasn't sure why. <br><br>Dismissing the notion as an aftereffect of the afternoon's adrenaline rush, Rhys parked between Terrian and a car that struck him at a glance as costing more than he'd probably seen in quite some time, his own car wheezing as he stopped the engine as though to emphasize this. He clambered out, shutting the door behind him and ambling over to where the others were standing.<br></div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Hamuu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">OOC - Sorry this will be short, but classes started up and I don't want you guys having to wait another couple of days on me.<br><br>BIC - Jonas parked his motorcycle and lifted his goggle, resting them on his mane of wild hair. He stretched, causing several popping noises to cascade down his spine. They weren’t regular joint pops either, more like bubble wrap than bone. <br><br>“Ugh, I’ma need ta put a back on dat seat some time soon.” He said rubbing his back as he leaned on the trunk of Terrian’s car. It sagged heavily but didn’t dent, “Ya think we’re gonna have to fight again? It’s not dat I’m scared or nothin’ jus’ dat I don’ wanna see any innocent people get hurt.”<br></div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Beelzebibble</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message"><i>OOC: A little Jonas autoing for the purpose of elevator comfort.</i><br><br>Terrian considered the question as the group moved through the garage toward the brassy elevator. "I... hmm. Well, I can't guarantee that there won't be any more fighting," he said up to Jonas. "But so far, you three are all the 'innocent people' involved in this that I can see. So you know, long as you guys look after yourselves, if anyone gets deep sixed it'll just be the <i>guilty</i> parties." He jerked a thumb briefly toward his chest.<br><br>Immediately after he'd pressed the up button on the elevator, the door slid noiselessly open. Cedar interior. Not bad, not bad. Terrian hung back to let Jonas pack in there first, but the enormous man compressed again, deflating to a manageable size so the elevator could accommodate all four of them. After Rie and Rhys had gone in as well, Terrian entered and pressed the button marked with "1" and a star.<br><br>The elevator opened onto a large, ornate room done up in yellow, with a high ceiling decorated by Romanesque arcading. All of the walls were either stone or marble. The open space at the room's center was framed by a tasteful scattering of chairs, sofas and small tables topped by marble lamps. If there was any doubt that the place was doing good business, the customers and employees bustling through in all directions dispelled that. Terrian charted a path through these mobile and immobile obstacles to the main desk, though it turned out not to be perfect and he ended up having to excuse himself to a muscular young man with shaggy blonde hair who was moving toward the fireplace.<br><br>All three clerks were busy at the moment, but Terrian took a place to speak with a young red-haired woman, whose line was currently the shortest. He looked behind him at Rie, Rhys and the freshly decompressed Jonas.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Hamuu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">It was strange for Jonas, after heaving spent so many years alone, to suddenly have people around him again. People he could call friends. He used to have friends long ago, lots of them too. When he thought hard he could almost remember their names. Only one three people ever stood out clearly enough for him to remember and one of them was James.<br><br>~*~<br><br><i>"You better slow down Shrimp!" James chuckled as he leaned against the railing with a few officers as they watched Jonathan in the middle of a keg stand.<br><br>The moon was out with a clear sky. Waves lapped up against the edge of the sub calmly, disturbed only by the few enlisted men crazy enough to dive in the icy water. Most of the party was below decks but a few privileged officers and their friends were out in the refreshing cool night air. <br><br>"Ah, you jush jealoush." Jonathan slurred back to James as he wiped his mouth and picked up a large glass of brandy. <br><br>"H-hey look-k what-t I f-found!" one of the enlisted men shouted as he pulled himself from the water, teeth chattering. <br><br>The men gathered around him as he held up a strange round blue fruit with green dots of varying size. <br><br>"What do you think it is?" James asked.<br><br>"Looks like a devil fruit." someone in the crowd interjected.<br><br>"That's just a stupid myth." someone else shouted.<br><br>"Whatsh all the yellin' about?" Jonathan pushed his way to the front. <br><br>"Hey," the same person from earlier shouted, "Make Shrimp eat it!"<br><br>"That shmall thing? Dat'll barely fill my shtomach!" Jonathan laughed as he picked it up.<br><br>James reached out in an attempt to stop him but Jonathan had already gulped it down.<br><br>"Shee! Nothin wron-" Jonathan grabbed at his stomach, "Ahhh!"<br><br>With a slight popping sound his body burst out in all directions, ripping his clothes and knocking several people overboard in the process. He stood over them fear etched into his gigantic face. <br><br>"Watcsh happening??" his voice boomed, "Shomeone help!" <br><br>"He's turned into a monster! Look, the metals buckling under his feet! Push him off!" <br><br>Everyone who wasn't helping pull people from the water ran at Jonathan, edging slowly towards the water.<br><br>"Fellas, dere's no need ta… wait… why'm I talkin' like dis?" <br><br>Jonathan fell backward into the water. He tried to kick, to swim but for some reason he couldn't.<br><br>Before his head sunk under the waves he saw the last few stragglers climb down into the sub and shut the hatch behind them. Just as he lost consciousness he felt a hand grab him.</i><br><br>~*~<br><br>"Watch where you're going you big oaf!" an elderly woman shouted at Jonas as he bumped into her.<br><br>"I'm so sorry ma'am. I shoulda been payin' attention ta where I was headed." <br><br>"Ogre!" she spat at him before walking off quickly. <br><br>Jonas frowned as he watched her go. He wiped his brow and then located Terrian and fell in behind the young man. <br><br>"Hopefully we don' run inta any more small spaces like da elevater. It takes a lot a energy to compress my self down like dat."<br></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Rie looked around the reception hall. Faux-Roman marble constructs littered the area. Exactly as ritzy as she thought it would be. This could potentially lead to some high paying jobs. She wouldn't have to work as much, which would leave her more time to... do nothing. What was she doing with herself? Nothing. Just satisfying some artificially built satisfaction-response when doing a job right. With Ender gone...<br><br>She stopped her thought process there. Getting lost in thought was how you got yourself shot, especially in the dragon's den.<br><br>She was getting some stares due to her cloak, but she was used to stuff like that. It was either weirded-out stares from a dubious choice of garments, or panicked stares from seeing a one-woman army, and panicked stares often lead to issues with security.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">SV</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Rhys surveyed the hotel lobby with his hands in his pockets. The whole place had that smell that all nice hotels have in common, a smell that was a mix of a somehow clinical hospitality, clean linens, and the lingering scents of a thousand anonymous visitors before you. The kind of smell that might make one wonder about who had ever been here and why. Rhys had, once, many years ago but only months before his relocation to the Archipelago, and not this hotel, but one on the mainland. <br><br>In the city of Westergate, which he had come to think of as the continent's equivalent of Slateport, Rhys had spoken at a press conference hosted in a similar hotel's convention room. An investigative reporter at the time, he had released an exposé focusing on a man named Gregoric van Hudson. Van Hudson had been a very powerful (and very corrupt, as it turned out) president of several of the region's industries -- not all of which were strictly legal -- before his gruesome death at the hands of one of van Hudson's own hitmen, Daniel Greene. It was the kind of story that should have catapulted Rhys's career. Instead, after months of blackmail and threats and an attempted murder, all believed to be orchestrated by Greene himself, Rhys moved to the Archipelago. And now, a virtually unemployed freelance reporter, here he stood in the lobby of one such hotel again.<br><br>A rude old woman started chastising Jonas, snapping Rhys out of his reverie. He scowled as she walked away and, hands still in his pockets, he joined Terrian and Jonas at the main desk.<br><br><br>OOC: OH GOD I'm so sorry this is so bad. =(</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Beelzebibble</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message"><i>OOC: Bad? Not in the least.</i><br><br><br>The customer ahead of them moved away, leaving Terrian clear to step up to the marble counter. The red-haired clerk was kind of cute. Round cheeks, a few freckles. She smiled politely at him, then spoke in a faintly British-sounding accent. "Good afternoon, sir! Do you have a reservation?"<br><br>With a smile of his own, Terrian said softly, "Actually, I was hoping to speak with your manager if possible. Or managers. Whatever you'd say."<br><br>The clerk's expression remained bright, but she missed a beat before responding. "Ah, yes?"<br><br>"Let me, Flo," said another woman who'd emerged from a door behind the counter. This one had much longer, curlier hair and slightly darker skin. A little more in keeping with Terrian's expectations, all in all. She raised a hand to beckon them over; he nodded to the red-haired clerk and moved off to the side of the counter, followed by Jonas, Rie and Rhys. The dark-haired woman fixed him with a particularly scrutinizing look, but her voice was quite smooth as she said, "Do you have a meeting arranged?"<br><br>Terrian pressed a finger against his jaw to soothe a sudden itch. "Well, no, not formally. That's -- I'd like to arrange that, if..." The woman was already detaching herself from the conversation. "Uh, listen, just tell them Terrian Brogue is here hoping for a friendly audience. Would you?"<br><br>He didn't seem to have made an impression on her by dropping his name in there, but her brow let up a bit, and after another moment's looking them over, she nodded. "Stay here, please," she said, and retreated into the office she'd emerged from. Terrian drummed his fingers on the counter and looked at the others, none of whom appeared too impressed by his subtlety. He threw another glance at the young red-haired clerk, who was taking another customer. New here, maybe. That would explain why she hadn't quite known how to react to his words. Perhaps she wasn't even aware of the true nature of this place and its administration. Oh well. You couldn't expect a single brushstroke to understand that it was part of the painting. Took a really enlightened soul to be able to step back and see the work of art in all its--<br><br>"Mr. Brogue. You may speak to the managers."<br><br>The dark-haired woman was back. "Oh fantastic," Terrian said quickly.<br><br>She pointed to a hallway extending out of the lobby on Terrian's right. The nearest pair of doors, propped open, revealed the dining room. "Carry on to the far end of the hall," the woman said, "and move into the lounge. Someone will be there to receive you."<br><br>"Perfect. Thanks very much." Terrian gave the woman a second to furnish them with any cryptic words of advice or warning, but she turned and disappeared again into her office, closing the door behind her. <br><br>To the others, Terrian said, "Shall we?"<br><br>They set off out of the lobby and down the hall. As they were passing the doors that opened onto the dining room, Terrian slowed up to get a look inside. Bright room -- lots of windows. Tall, too. Actually it looked like there was a balcony overhead. Points for style. He let his eyes drop back down to the customers taking their lunch at the tables on the ground floor. He was about to start up again when he noticed something. There was a familiar-looking man in the crowd.<br><br>Terrian took a few steps into the dining room. Yes, that man, another redhead, was definitely a familiar face. Couldn't place the young woman who was eating at the same table, but since when was not knowing someone a deterrent to Terrian? Yes, because his track record with strangers was so excellent. Terrian moved toward the table, grinning.<br><br>"Prime!"</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Hamuu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">“Prime?” Jonas followed Terrian’s gaze until he saw the familiar face enjoying his lunch, “Ha! Well wha’do ya know.”<br><br>Jonas smiled as he followed after Terrian. He’d met Prime before, not long ago while running an errand for Sly. <br><br>“Wha’ ya doin here fella?” he looked over, notcing the young woman for the first time. He straightened up and bowed politely as he extended his hand, “Nice to meet ya ma’am. My name is Jonas Caliban.” <br><br>OOC- Feels short… <br></div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">hermes</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Jonas!" Prime said brightly, getting up to give the man a punch on the arm, and embrace him in a quick hug. "Its been a while since I've seen you, and I thank you very much for the lessons, they've been extremely helpful." He nodded to the main, then turned to Terrian.<br><br>"I suppose its good to see you as well Terrian," Prime said, a little more neutral, but not quite cold. "Please understand my hesitation here, but the last time we were together, you were.... Well, you recall. You really do need to learn how to pick the lesser of two evils in a situation. I mean, unless I think the victim is pure evil, I'm generally more inclined to trust the victim..." Prime trailed off, sighed, and nodded to Terrian.<br><br>"This," Prime said, suddenly remembering himself, "Is Alyssa. She's shy, but let me tell you, she's a trip when she's angry. Try not to be to gruff Jonas. And as for you Terrian, your naught but trouble, don't even this about charming the young lady." Prime growled, and nearly kicked himself for sounding like a mother hen, but Terrian did have a wonderful talent for getting shot at.<br><br>And Alyssa... She'd watched his back, back then... So he had to watch hers, he owed her.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Beelzebibble</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message"><i>OOC: From here out, we don't need to adhere to turn orders quite as rigidly.</i><br><br>"Wait, when was the last time we were t-- oh! Pizza Hut!" Terrian snapped his fingers brightly. "Hey man, I thought anchovies <i>were</i> the lesser of two evils, I don't know what your... guys's problems... was." Damn. He really should have checked with Alpha before charging into a sentence like that. Oh well, the moment was gone.<br><br>After catching Prime's unamused glare, he called on all his expressive specificity to give the other man a look that said <i>Later, okay?</i> He didn't feel like defending the Fascere Order to Prime in front of these other people. Actually he wasn't sure he could defend the Order at all without seeming like a hypocrite until he returned to their ranks, but this was neither the time nor place to get hung up on such questions. If Prime still bore them some kind of animosity, he could go play bongo drums on Auguste Tylor's skull and leave Terrian out of it.<br><br>He looked up at Jonas. "You two know each other? No kidding? How?" He traced a finger across the back edge of the unoccupied chair at the table. "Well, that saves on some introductions, I guess. Now all I have to say is, hi Alyssa, it's nice to meet you, I'm Terrian, here we have Rie, and over there's Rhys -- Prime, you know him too? No? Rhys, Prime."<br><br>Terrian noticed that he was talking over his shoulder in the direction of Rhys while also reaching out a hand to shake the unfamiliar girl Alyssa's. Oh the social contortions he could maneuver himself into.<br></div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">ch00beh</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Rie hadn't let her guard down, but she was not actively looking for traps. It was a front. Fronts were mostly safe because normal people came by all the time. She did take note of all the mostly hidden cameras around. There were probably several others that were more thoroughly concealed. She also noticed a small handful of people who seemed too aware to be patrons, as well.<br><br>The girl turned her attention to the two diners that Terrian had started talking to. She recognized Prime. All he got was an acknowledging stare. She didn't recognize the girl. She got a quick size-up stare. <br><br>Rie leaned against a nearby pillar and went back to her casual room scans.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Alyssa jumped with surprise when Prime shouted and immediately turned to watch as Prime embraced someone whom he appeared to be friends with. She continued to watch as he greeted the other members of the group, and even stepped forward when she was introduced, though she still kept some distance between them. <br><br>When one of them stepped forward and introduced himself as Terrian, she reached forward to take the hand he had extended to her in welcome, but retracted it when he turned to introduce Prime to someone named Rhys. </div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">SV</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Rhys trailed into the dining room behind Rie. The dining room was large, bright in the early afternoon light, and only a handful of its many tables were occupied. Aside from the red-headed man and the girl in front of them, there were a pair of men sitting at a table opposite the room from them. Something about the latter seemed off to him, as though they were listening in on them. <br><br>He tried to push this out of mind as Terrian introduced them to his acquaintance, though this acquaintance, Prime, didn't seem to have a high opinion of him. Rhys inclined his head to the man and caught Terrian's eye with a look that inquired as to why Prime decided that the dapper young gentleman was "naught but trouble."<br><br>Prime's female associate was Alyssa. His first opinion of the girl was that she was shy, but the way she retracted her hand from Terrian when Rhys was introduced hinted at some kind of caution, possibly because of him. He studied her for a moment, trying to remember if he'd met her before, but he didn't think he had.<br><br>The last couple hours had done nothing if not convince Rhys that there was something much larger going on that he was not privy to. Across the room, the men's presence nagged in the back of his mind.<br><br>OOC: I suck. So sorry for the delay =S</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Hamuu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">OOC- Finally, I have some time to Post!<br><br>BIC - “Yeah, Jonas and I met not to long ago.” Prime said as he returned Rie’s acknowledging stare with one of his own then politely nodded to Rhys, “Since then he’s been giving me lessons in hand to hand combat. Did you know he was in the American Navy?”<br><br>“Dat’s un’nportant right now.” Jonas butted in, quickly steering the conversation away from his past, “We’re here ta…” <br><br>The large man looked at Terrian for a moment, unsure just how much he wanted out in the open. Not only that but Jonas wasn’t sure just how many people outside their little group might be listening. Considering the stares they were attracting it might be better to play it safe for now.<br><br>Jonas looked back at Prime, “Well, we’re here fer business.”<br><br>“Really?” Prime asked, “Me too, well, sort of. I hadn’t told Alyssa yet, but I’ve been searching for a sword called the <i>Reiki</i>. Everything I’ve found out about it so far has brought me here. So far though I haven’t had any luck finding it.”<br></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"The Rakey? What does that -- does that, like, grant the bearer divine control over the fallen autumn leaves or...? Okay, okay. God! Wow!" For Prime had fixed him with an identical unamused glare. The man was a smoke-belching factory of stony-faced scowls and his own personal Industrial Revolution was just getting into high gear.<br><br>Yet more grudges coming back to haunt Terrian. At this point it seemed quicker to count the people involved in the brush with the Fascere Order in Hawaii who <i>didn't</i> look on him as the scum of the earth. Pretty much just Sly, and Ender, peace be upon him. And on the other side, here was all this distrust and moralizing coming from Prime's direction, and the whole general kind of estrangement from Valon, and Natalie... Well, the phone chat with Natalie had proven she and Terrian still weren't best buds yet. And somehow he suspected Nopcsa wasn't thinking of him too fondly at the moment either. There was one that could use some patching up as soon as he figured out how.<br><br>As far as Prime went, though, Terrian was pretty sure they could get along okay in their current state. It wasn't like Terrian had ever shot him in the leg or bailed on his organization or anything.<br><br>Even so, while his next question, "What makes you think a sword like that's going to be around here anyhow? Stashed away in a minibar in one of the rooms or something? No no, come on, I'm actually being serious here" was directed at Prime, the question after that, "How's the food here by the way? Worth the price tag? Looks tasty enough," was directed at Alyssa. The only person here who Terrian could be <i>totally</i> sure didn't harbor any past resentment toward him. A rare treasure indeed!</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"I don't know, I didn't order anything" replied Alyssa in a mildly surprised voice. She was certain that after the semi-polite introduction she'd be left alone, but now she felt she was being pulled into a conversation with someone whom Prime didn't seem to care all that much for. <br><br>"Prime was the one eating though, so you should really ask him..." <br><br>OOC: Sorry about the wait for this, I got back from the concert later than I thought, and I wanted to review Alyssa's lines in Shrinking.</div></div>

I want to believe that, I really do. But what happened back then… Just because there can be as many of you as there are choices doesn’t mean you’ll have as many outcomes.

Part of me wants to trust you, but the other half won’t let me. When I really trust you I’ll tell you more.” Prime took a bite of his food, “And it tastes like you would expect hotel food to be like.”<br><br>OOC – K, so I am still figuring out Prime and having to play off other people to figure out how he interacts with them… expect Primes personality to shift some more… <br></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"We're not allies? I always thought... No? Really? All right. Listen, you know I wasn't asking about the Rakey because I wanted to steal it from you or anything. Think we can all imagine... me with a sword..." Terrian waved his arms around uselessly to demonstrate. "Yeah. Be a little silly. It's okay though. I wish you luck, and -- I hope -- that we get the chance to..." He trailed off. Both Rie and Rhys were looking a bit impatient. "That we get the chance to talk about this some more and resolve the emotional barrier that's arisen between yes all right guys is it go time? Is that what I'm sensing here."<br><br>Rhys was looking past Prime and Alyssa's table elsewhere in the room, but that didn't stop him from softly responding, "They're expecting us. They also don't seem like the kind we should keep waiting."<br><br>Rie hadn't said a thing, and it wasn't lost on Terrian that she'd barely acknowledged Prime's presence, even though he knew they'd worked together before. She made her point clear enough by standing up from the pillar she'd been leaning on and, with concise body language, taking a single step back toward the door.<br><br>"You're right," Terrian said. He took a sharp breath. It'd been kind of nice not having his imminent meeting with the Giarrettieras at the forefront of his mind. "You're absolutely right. Well, guys," he said to Prime and Alyssa, "we have an appointment so we will not keep you from your meal any further. Prime I hope we can talk later. Alyssa it was really nice meeting you."<br><br>"Good ta see ya again," Jonas said, clapping Prime on the back and practically making him drop his knife.<br><br>"Okay. Off we go." Terrian waved, then rounded and left the dining room, with Jonas, Rie and Rhys following behind, or, in Rie's case, already up ahead. She <i>really</i> didn't seem to want to waste any time.<br><br>"Sorry about that, Rhys," Terrian muttered. "Old friends popping up all over the place. Little embarrassing." Especially when they don't seem to think of themselves as old friends, he didn't add.<br><br>"Prime's a good guy tho'," Jonas said cheerily. Rie audibly snorted without looking back.<br><br>They proceeded up the hall, away from the lobby and alongside the dining room, to where someone was supposed to receive them in the lounge. The hall was surprisingly empty given how crowded the dining room had been. No one passed them by. Terrian chose not to view this as a bad omen.<br><br>He took another few deep breaths. Also surprising was the tense feeling which had gathered in his chest. Part of him said not to be afraid: that if he positively had to confront a Mafia boss in the first place, he couldn't make it any safer than this, with these three Powers by his side. Then there was the other, familiar part of him that said that he was being an idiot and that if the Giarrettieras didn't know who they were looking at they would probably just fill him with bullets and call it a day. And there was also the part that said that maybe this was simply the wrong thing to do, that there was no justification for facing the Giarrettieras directly instead of going to the police, that even skipping town would be better than this. Both of these voices, and many more, protested every step he took down the brightly-lit hallway to the open door ahead--<br><br><i>I've spotted a friend of yours in the garage. I'm going to say hello.</i><br><br>Alpha.<br><br><i>Another</i> friend.<br><br>God damn it. He was starting to think he'd been a little too liberal with the application of the word "friend" to his various acquaintances.<br><br>He wasn't going to concern himself with it just then. They were almost up to the lounge. He responded in shorthand: <i>okay tell later. need focus for chat.</i><br><br>He straightened the sleeves of his jacket a bit and steeled himself. He checked his tie. Looking good. He took his last deep breath. Glanced at his watch. 1:13 pm, fantastic. Terrian was all set to present himself before the Giarrettieras and negotiate. If nothing else he was going to make a very handsome corpse.<br><br><br><br><br><div align="center"><font face="Braggadocio"><font size="7">ISHKABIBBLE</font></font></div><br><br><br></div></div>
