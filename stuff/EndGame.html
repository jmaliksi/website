        <div class="content"><div class="message">He coughed lightly. <br><br>He had been listening to the light hum of electronics and the muffled cricket chirps from outside, but his cough disturbed the peaceful music of the night. His attention had been focused on the various lights shining in the darkness: the luminescent green digital clock; the dark yet glowing computer screen saver; the moonlight peaking through a crack in the blackout shades.<br><br>The cough had been consistent for a week now. <br><br>Lying down, alone in the dark, used to be so peaceful, especially after the chaos that constantly made up his days. So much fighting. For what? General world peace? <br><br>Those kinds of feelings only briefly flitted through his mind, dismissed as a random thought as soon as he was aware of their existence. Questions of morality when fighting never concerned him. He was, after all, ‘made’ to be a killing machine. The brainwashing worked; he didn’t think twice if he couldn’t save a person he didn’t know.<br><br>He coughed again.<br><br>He rolled onto his side. The coughs hadn’t been getting worse, but they weren’t getting any better. They weren’t hard enough to be considered a threat, but at the same time, they weren’t so soft that they weren’t annoying. At any rate, tonight, they were keeping him up.<br><br>He knew it had been coming. With his increased metabolism, his projected maximum age was 21, and he was currently 20. The scientists had managed to do some fancy work with his telomeres, though; he’d look and feel his age up until the end of his lifespan. At that point, the advanced aging would begin.<br><br>He sighed.<br><br>Ender stopped bothering to lie down. Sleep wouldn’t come. He had faced imminent death by aliens, machines, demons, everything, but none of that had phased him. However, there was something intrinsically disturbing about knowing the end was coming and not being able to do anything about it.<br><br>How much did he have left? One year? Six months? One month? Ender got out of bed and walked to the bathroom. He flicked on the lights and looked at himself in the mirror. He still looked young. No bags under his eyes. No forehead lines. No wrinkles. Nothing. Except…<br><br>“What the hell. A white hair.” Ender plucked out his first white hair from his head. <i>You know what they say about white hairs: when you pull one out, two grow back in its place.</i><br><br>Someone snored.<br><br>Rie had been sleeping in Ender’s house (well, it was Lee’s guest house) ever since she found him. She slept on the couch in the common room, which was every bit as comfortable as his bed, with the added advantage of being in front of the TV. Tonight the TV was off.<br><br>Ender unceremoniously plopped himself on the couch, right next to Rie’s head. She woke up with a start, her hand ready to break any intruders, but when she saw who it was, she relaxed, laying her head on Ender’s lap. Ender hit the TV’s on button with a telekinetic push.<br><br>“What’re you doing up?” Rie asked. She sounded like she was still sleeping.<br><br>“I think it’s that time,” Ender said absently.<br><br>“What? Four? Yeah, it’s four AM.”<br><br>“No.” Ender held his white hair in front of Rie’s half closed eyes. It took her a moment to realize what it was since the TV provided changing colors of light.<br><br>“Oh.”<br><br>“Yep.”<br><br>“Oh.”<br><br>Ender leaned back in the couch.<br><br>“<i>Oh</i>.” <br><br>Ender could’ve sworn he heard a sob and felt a tear on his pants. He looked down at Rie. She was still resting her head on Ender’s leg, but she was biting her thumbnail.<br><br>“Wow. Human emotion. I can die now, knowing I’ve seen everything,” Ender said. He stroked Rie’s hair.<br><br>“Shut up. That’s not funny,” Rie said while getting up. She scooted closer to Ender and put her arms around him, leaning her head on his shoulder. Ender put his head on hers.<br><br>After about half an hour of silence, Rie spoke up. “I hate this. I still get like what? 25 more years than you?”<br><br>“That sounds about right.”<br><br>“So… what are you gonna to do?”<br><br>“Eh, what can I do?  I was thinking… maybe I could just wander off. Get away from this life of slacker richness and saving the world and whatnot.”<br><br>“I’d ask where you would go, but there’s no point really. I take it you’d be going alone.”<br><br>“Obviously,” Ender said nonchalantly.<br><br>“And you’re a psychic who wouldn’t want to be found.”<br><br>“Pretty much.” <br><br>“But why? Why not stick around and disturb us with your death throws a couple months down the line?”<br><br>“Who knows what I’ll do when my mind snaps? Whelkshore's nice. All my friends live like three steps away from here. They’re the only people I’d give two shits for if they died.”<br><br>“You know we’d risk that.”<br><br>“But I wouldn’t.”<br><br>They both sat in silence for a moment before Ender gently let himself out of Rie’s embrace. He stood up and went to his room to change, coming out a minute later wearing jeans and a black shirt. His trenchcoat was half on, and he was getting the other half on while stepping out of the room. His reflective shades were already on his face. Rie was still on the couch, though she was hugging a pillow when Ender came out. There was no trace of tears and her face was expressionless.<br><br>“I’m leaving you in charge of all my stuff, Rie,” Ender said. “That includes even my laptop.”<br><br>“Your laptop? Damn, you’re serious, aren’t you? But don’t I need to be psychic to work it?”<br><br>“Being psychic just helps in making it go faster. It works pretty much the same as a normal computer.” Ender walked over to his friend and handed her the computer.<br><br>“I’m not going to find any… weird videos or AIs that’ll surprise me when you leave, will I?” Rie asked while examining the slim computer.<br><br>“Nah.”<br><br>The two stood up and hesitantly made their way to the door leading outside. Ender opened it and tossed the keys on the couch. “So this is goodbye.”<br>“I guess so.” Rie hugged him. “No point in dragging it out.”<br><br>“I agree.”<br><br>They smiled at each other then Rie went back inside and closed the door.<br><br>Ender turned away from the guest house and towards Zebedee’s mansion. He knew Nat was inside, probably asleep. He went to the main door and left a note on it.<br><br><i>Hey Nat,<br>So this is kinda random, but I’m going to die soon. Um, yeah. I’ve decided to pull a Zeb and head off and be like a hermit or something silly like that for the remainder of my life. Rie’s in the guest house now. Feel free to kick her lazy ass out of there.<br><br>Much love,<br>Ender</i><br><br><br><br>OOC: Hah, not much of a window for entrance, but whatevs. <img src="//images.proboards.com/f/smiley/tongue.png" alt=":P" class="smile"></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Demitri had a delivery to make in the town of Whelkshore. He had to make sure that the rival company didn't get these documents detailing super soldier serums and their affects. He had to meet at a local Town park by the statue of a Soldier or warrior of some type.  He was a Bit early so he did the most logical thing. Go get a drink at the gas station, He began to crave a lemon bomb  or a tangernade. <br><br>  He entered the store to see the Tolkien Indian store clerk. "Hello my friend, do you need any help?" he said happily with a smile of his off centered teeth. "No no no I know what I want" he said moving towards the freezers. He quickly grabbed both of his favorites and left exact change on the counter.  The drinks were placed into his pack pack as he revved up his bike to get to the rendezvous point. <br><br> His legs have been bothering him since his operation. The seem to vibrate around certain people. The more intense the vibration the more power the individual has.  The must have added that in at the the last tune up at the lab. He vaguely remembers Dr. Morris telling him of the upgrade he had received after the Lemar connection.  The upgrade included improved locomotion, more knife capacity, and interchangeable parts. Demitri didn't understand most of this mumbo jumbo at the time but he guessed it'll come to him eventually.<br><br>Suddenly, his legs began to vibrate softly then more vigorously then before. It became painful after a couple minutes of the  high intensity manipulation. It made him close his eyes, which proved to be a mistake. Just as he closed his eyes a car t-boned him in the side. He fell on the hood like a freshly killed dear on a hunters car.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">The morning light began peeking through the windows of Zebedee's home, turning the motes of dust golden as they drifted. The light crept across the room, falling upon the peaceful face of a girl, still sleeping on her side. Feeling the sun, she tried rolling over and burying her face in her pillow. She stifled a groan, and shoved her head deeper into the bed. The rays continued their nagging, however, and there was no way that she'd end up going back to sleep. Grumbling incoherently, Sylvia Natalie Ulima threw the covers aside and stumbled out of bed. Her right hand immediately went to her nightstand, groping around blindly until she grabbed a bizarre looking charm bracelet. She then proceeded to stagger to the bathroom, adjusting her pajama-top so that it didn't leave her stomach uncovered. She was fine with baring her midriff when she was fully done up, but in her pajamas, it just made her feel slovenly. <br><br>She closed the door, shrugged off her pajamas, and then stepped into the shower, turning the knob to the cold side of lukewarm. She needed to wake up better. As she tended to her washing up, she began thinking. <i>What was it that I was dreaming about last night? I just can't quite dig it up... </i> She began shampooing her hair. <i> All I know is that it gave me a feeling of... dread, I guess. It wasn't even really a bad dream, but it felt like I had something heavy bearing down on me the whole time. </i> Natalie stepped out of the shower, grabbed the bracelet, and latched it securely on a wrist. In a literal blink of an eye, she was fully clothed and groomed, her hair back in the spreading ponytail that had become her trademark, her sky blue tee stopping just below her ribs, and her dark green canvas pants slung low on her hips, held up by a broad tan belt. She checked her appearance once more in the mirror, pausing to rub the condensation off it with a towel, and then opened the door.<br><br>She stretched and choked out a yawn, and then stepped lightly towards the front door. Maybe a jog around the block would do the job for her. She knelt, picking up her shoes, and then realized that she had forgot her socks. Really not her morning, not at all. She groaned and walked back to her room to grab a pair of socks. As she opened her dresser drawer, she bit her lip in thought. She quickly picked a pair of socks that went decently with her clothes, and then, still slipping them on, hopped over to the side of her bed. Reaching beneath her mattress, she produced a coiled mass of steel. She hefted it slightly, testing its weight. She probably wouldn't need her weapon today... But these days, nobody was sure of anything. She clipped it to her belt, making sure the blade was locked in position. With the way she was screwing up today, she didn't need any weaponry accidents to complicate things.<br><br>Sighing, she dragged herself back to the front entry, and hopped into her sneakers, tieing them and then double checking the knots. She stood up, and opened the front door. A piece of paper fluttered to the ground. Natalie almost dismissed it as a flyer, but then noticed that it was Zebedee's stationary. He'd want it, whatever it was. She knelt down, and picked up the note, only to realize that it was in Ender's handwriting. She quickly scanned the note, checked it again, and then read through it slowly a third time. Her hands began to shake.<br><br>Turning as she stood up, she opened the door to her home, and then slammed it behind her as loudly as she could manage. She stalked back through the house, turning into Zebedee's bedroom. Still holding the note in her hand, she stepped towards where he slept on the floor, face down. She stood still for a moment, Zebedee stirring and then turning to look at her. Groggily, he blinked a few times.<br><br>"What's up?" Zebedee reached beside him and produced his glasses. He toyed with the earpieces for a moment before putting them on.<br><br>"This," Natalie muttered and stepped up to him, booting him in the ribs. “Get up. We don’t have time to sit around with our thumbs up our ***es,” She turned and left the room, leaving Zebedee clutching his ribs on the carpet.<br><br>She swept through the kitchen and into the back hall. She opened the back door and kicked the storm door aside, not even bothering to close either one. Not breaking her stride, she simply skipped the steps to the back door, landing roughly on the grass. There was a flash of light behind her, and Zebedee appeared, trying to sort himself out.<br><br>“Seriously, what’s going on?” He asked, trying to smooth out his bedhead.<br><br>“You’ll find out soon enough. Shut up.” Natalie snarled, and came to the door of the guest house. Unceremoniously, she raised her right foot, and with a grunt, kicked the door in. As it tumbled to the floor, Zebedee put a hand on her shoulder.<br><br>“Calm down. You’re going to give Ender a headache with all this negativity.” He cautioned. Natalie shoved him aside.<br><br>“We don’t need to worry about that.” She spat, and stepped into the house. She looked down in disdain at the welcome mat, and she passed the note to her left hand, her right going to her blade.<br><br>“RIE! WHAT THE **** IS THIS ABOUT?” Natalie shouted into the house, Zebedee nervously standing behind her.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">OOC: DOUBLE POOOOOOOST<br><br>BIC:<br>Rie had gone back to lie down on the couch after Ender left. She wasn't crying. She didn't even bother to hug the pillow again. Her face was as emotionless as it usually was.<br><br>Suddenly there was a loud crack as the door's hinges broke. Rie quickly went into alert mode. On the couch, she was hidden from the door. In one motion, the girl threw a pillow into the air as a distraction, rolled off, grabbed her rifle from under the couch, and phased through the floor. Moments later her gun phased out of the floor again, pointed at the door, the top portion of her head behind the gun's sights. When she saw it was Nat, she almost relaxed. Rie rose up from floor like some kind of ghost.<br><br>"RIE! WHAT THE CRUDONKEY IS THIS ABOUT?"<br><br>Rie didn't invite them in.<br><br>"Ender's left." Her voice was perfectly emotion-less. "You may have noticed how much Ender eats. It's a side effect of his increased metabolism, which was designed to make him function better as a killing machine. Well, with that increased metabolism, not only did his body function faster and more efficiently, it aged faster. The scientists who created us projected his termination at age 21."</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Natalie paused, listening to what Rie said. The news was bad enough... But that horrid, emotionless tone- That only made it so much worse. Some people dealt best with emotion by pushing it away. Natalie wasn't the type. However she felt at the time, she took it to heart.<br><br>"And he couldn't have told us that?" Natalie growled, trying to restrain herself. At the moment, she couldn't tell if she wanted to break down sobbing, or if she wanted to punch Rie. Maybe both.<br><br>"You know Ender, Nat. He always wanted us to be as happy as possible. Saying something that would drag us down-" Zebedee began to say quietly, only to be stopped by a hand on his throat. He reflexively teleported out of her grasp, reappearing outside the entrance.<br><br>"Don't you dare talk about him like he's already gone. You got that?" Natalie snarled, her anger rekindled. Of all of the people, she had to be stuck with a lifeless doll and an apathetic holy man. She wanted people with emotions... People that laughed and cried, people that would actually react to this. People that bled, not dried up creatures that stifled themselves.<br><br>"I didn't mean it like that." Zebedee responded with downcast eyes.<br><br>"I'm sure you didn't." Natalie grimly muttered, and then turned back to Rie.<br><br>"Now, where would he have gone to? I've got a list of places I can already think of, but I don't know him as well as you do. What kind of spot would he escape to first?" Natalie tried to contain the menace in her voice as much as possible. She didn't need a fight... She needed a fight. Ender had always been much closer to her than Zebedee or Sly, and after Rick's departure, she had found herself counting on him all the more... For him to go and just turn on her like this... To betray her... Natalie wiped some tears from her cheeks while she waited for Rie to answer her.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message"><i>OOC - Terrian will learn about the Cherrygrove Alliance in Triannual? Sweet. That RP gives me so much to look forward to.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"I..." Rie's lip almost quivered. Almost. She immediately regained her cool. "I wouldn't know. But I'd guess he's not in the mood to teleport. He'd be thinking. He could even be at Whelkshore's outskirts, still, just walking and whatever."<br><br>Rie shrugged on the outside. Inside she was starting to break down again. There was a reason she had kept the goodbye brief. "I didn't want to follow him, but you guys need to say your goodbyes." There was a hint of moisture in her eye. Not quite tears. </div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Rick looked down at the table, “You’re sure?”<br><br>&lt;<i>Yes, just a few moments ago. It wasn’t entirely clear, but he was definitely trying to make sure I knew what was transpiring.</i>&gt; Sly said as he paced slowly around the room. <br><br>“Where is he now?” <br><br>&lt;<i>That much was not revealed to me. If he knows we’ll find out when we arrive.</i>&gt;<br><br>Rick was about to speak when the door opened. He turned to see Mia staring at the two of them from the doorway.<br><br>“Rick…?” Mia questioned uneasily as she looked Sly over, her eyes lingering on his tail-blade. <br><br>“It’s alright. This is my father.” Rick said. He had been setting on the back of the chair with his feet on the seat but had gotten up and walked over to Mia. “I told you he wasn’t human.”<br><br>Sly turned his head so he could face her with his main eyes. &lt;<i>It’s a pleasure to make your acquaintance. I will spare you my full introduction, just call me Sly. I assume you are the girlfriend my son has told me nothing about?</i>&gt;<br><br>“My name is Mia and yes you would be correct. It’s a pleasure to meet you.” Mia, somewhat more at ease, entered the room followed by a large wooden trunk that floated a few feet above the ground. Atop the trunk were a few wooden crates filled with various meats and fruits. She walked passed the two of them and into another room that Sly assumed was the kitchen, the trunk followed.<br><br>&lt;<i>You two live together?</i>&gt; Sly questioned.<br><br>“Yeah, sorry I really haven’t told you about any of this.” Rick said as he resumed setting on the back of the chair, “Things have been hectic since the demons attacked. A lot of people have been pushing for another shield spell to be placed on the city, effectively cutting Shin-Ra off from the world again. I’ve been trying to gather support against it but I just don’t think I am cut out for politics.”<br><br>&lt;<i>Nor was I.</i>&gt;<br><br>Rick smiled and though it was hard to tell he knew his father was smiling too. For a moment life almost had a feel of normalcy to it.<br><br>“Rick, is your father staying for supper?” Mia asked as she poked her head through the door.<br><br>Sly looked at Mia with a stalk-eye while his main eyes were focused on Rick. &lt;<i>We cannot linger. There is no way to tell when Ender may perish.</i>&gt;<br><br>Rick nodded, “Mia, we have a friend who needs help. I know this is sudden but my father and I have to go.”<br><br>Mia looked back and forth between the two for a moment, “Fine.” She said as she withdrew back into the kitchen. A moment later she emerged no longer wearing the long white robe that designated her as a white mage. Instead she wore a white t-shirt with blue jeans and a pair of sandals. Her green hair, which had been tied back previously, now fell freely around her shoulders. The wooden trunk followed her into the room. “I’m coming with you.” She said.<br><br>Sly thought for a moment before turning a stalk-eye towards his son, &lt;<i>Did she just change clothes in the kitchen?</i>&gt;<br><br>Rick nodded, “Yeah I think so. I should probably go change too. These ceremonial mage outfits aren’t very comfy.”<br><br>“For your information I was wearing this underneath my robes!” Mia called up the stairs after Rick as he hurried up to their bedroom.<br><br>She turned as though startled and looked at Sly, “Did I just hear you chuckle in my head?” <br><br>Sly had taken off his watch and was now twisting the gears as he probed it with a small metal pick. His main eyes turned towards Mia while his stalk-eyes continued on what he was doing. &lt;<i>So you are unphased when you hear my voice in your thoughts but when I laugh that’s what finally freaks you out?</i>&gt;<br><br>“Sorry,” Mia murmured as she sat in the chair Rick had been using. For a moment she watched Sly before speaking again. “What are you doing to that watch?”<br><br>&lt;<i>This is actually a device that allows me to teleport from one point to another. I have several different objects that do this but the watch has proven to be most effective. The other such devices have a habit of depositing people in the air above their destinations.</i>&gt;<br><br>Mia tilted her head, “It’s technology right?”<br><br>Sly nodded as he shut the face of the watch and put the metal pick back in his bag. &lt;<i>Yes, why? Do your people frown on such things?</i>&gt;<br><br>“For the most part, yes.” Mia answered. “I have done some reading since the shield spell failed. Books we would never have had access to other wise. It seems to me the technology was something created by the peoples of this world who didn’t have powers. At first I thought of it as an inferior form of magic but as I continued studying I realized it was very much its own thing. Just as potent as magic depending on the hands who used it.”<br><br>&lt;<i>I think you are very quickly gaining my favor.</i>&gt; Sly said. Mia wasn’t sure but for a second she thought he was smiling.<br><br>Rick returned wearing his usual black combat boots and black denim jeans. The blue button shirt he was wearing would have been rather fashionable had the sleeves not been ripped from it. His thick blue hair was short and messy as always. The Phoenix, the amber jeweled necklace which had been passed down to him, hung lazily around his neck and attached to his belt was the hilt of the Diablo, a black mage sword that changed shape depending on the users need.<br><br>Mia stood up from the chair and went to stand near Rick. Slys tail-blade slithered through the air and wrapped around the two. He gave no warning as he flipped the dial and their surroundings were torn away from them. Instead they now stood near the entrance of Lees quest house. Rie, Nat, and Lee were all staring at each other as they stood in the doorway to the guesthouse. Ender was absent.<br><br>&lt;<i>Alright, what exactly is transpiring here?</i>&gt; Sly said as he approached the others. <br></div></div>

Once she saw who it was, her face relaxed slightly, and her hand went back to its former position, clenched at her side. Zebedee went to say something, but was shushed by Natalie shoving him lightly.<br><br>"Ender's dying, so he ran off like a ****ing *****. His body's burning itself out due to the metabolism the scientists engineered him with." Natalie said, her conveying more anger than sorrow. She turned to Rie for a moment, and then turned back to Sly. "She says he's still in Whelkshore." Natalie was about to say something more when a strong voice cut her off.<br><br>"Then we can find him." Zebedee stated, his face set in determination and a hint of holy light dancing through the air around him. He turned around, and faced Rie. "Listen. If we can get to Ender, I'm sure we can do something. We've got two expert magicians and a master of science far beyond anything on earth... If anybody can save Ender's life, or at least prolong it, it's us. And we'll do whatever it takes... Whatever it takes." He gave a small grin, faint but steady. "We need you to help us, though. Nobody needs to say goodbye, if we can stop him." Zebedee nodded slightly, and turned to face the others.<br><br>"Sly, you've been getting my plans for the search, right?" He tapped his finger on the side of his head. "We've got two people that can teleport, and we all can fly. Hunting for him should be a piece of cake." Zebedee's grin faded for a moment, but he quickly returned to form.<br><br>Natalie stood still, watching this all happen. Zebedee was bull****ting his way through the whole process... Took the news easy, gave directions easy. He was either too blinded by faith or too stupid to realize that this was going to be the hardest thing they'd ever need to do.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message"><i>OOC - All right, fine, I can't see any better way of entering than to indulge Kaz in his odd little subplot. May it find its way to Ender or the main group soon... Anyway, who knows? This may give me an out in case what I want to do in Triannual falls through.</i><br><br><br>The dashing, attractive young man glanced at a statue of what looked like a colonial-era minuteman as he drove past the Whelkshore Park. It stirred something in him: a vague, inconsequential memory of an exhibit in a museum of history that he had visited when he was eleven or twelve. This thoroughly mundane detail would not have been brought to the reader's attention if not for the slightly more interesting facts that the young man had not once set foot inside any museum of history and he had never been eleven or twelve.<br><br>Well. He hadn't, and he had. It was hard to choose just one of those. Both at once seemed more appropriate.<br><br>That was it, really. The paradox of being both at once -- both himself, in the car, and the original Terrian, who was calling on a female friend during this his second visit to Whelkshore, at once. On the one hand, the duplicate Brogue was no more than a couple of hours old; on the other, he had twenty-six years' worth of memories, knowledge, experience and skill. <br><br>This contradiction would have been a lot more overwhelming to Brogue, and impossible to articulate so easily, if he wasn't able to draw upon all the memories of past duplicates apprehending and coming to terms with the very same paradox. <i>Which just goes to show,</i> he thought.<br><br>Meanwhile, amidst all this psycho-philosophical pondering, there was the matter of the task Terrian had appointed him, which was simply to roam the city and become acquainted with it -- a goal which Terrian had not, for various reasons, been able to accomplish during his first weekend here. Brogue supposed the park ought to be worth a look. He turned left, intending to circle around the park's perimeter and drive in.<br><br>Just as he was making the turn, he saw a motorcyclist attempting to turn into the same lane from the other side of the street. The man's eyes were closed. Brogue had only enough time to think, <i>Okay, that explains it,</i> and then his car struck the motorcycle's side.<br><br>The man collapsed heavily onto the car's hood; there was the sound of breaking glass and Brogue thought for a wild moment that the man was crashing through the windshield, but he then realized it was probably something inside the fellow's backpack, which had come down particularly hard against the metal. Fortunately there were no other cars driving through the intersection at the moment, which allowed Brogue a moment's freedom to survey the scene. <br><br><i>What would I do?</i><br><br>It wasn't a stupid question, or at least he hoped it wasn't, because he could hear echoes of that same phrase being thought by dozens of duplicates that had come before him. Would Terrian start shouting? Probably not; it didn't look like the car had been damaged. Would Terrian apologize? The motorcycle and its rider both looked intact as well, and anyway, it had been his fault, not Brogue's.<br><br>No, he decided Terrian would most likely make a light-hearted comment about it to show there were no hard feelings, so he got out of the car, helped the man to his feet, and said, "Well! You looked like you were enjoying yourself there for a moment, I hope I didn't harsh your buzz. But maybe you'd rather search for peace and tranquility within yourself out on some back road, instead of in the city? Just a suggestion."<br><br>The man's backpack was now dripping gently, so Brogue added, "Oh, and you've sprung a leak. I think something's broken in there."</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">An orange whisp danced through the sky and wafted to the ground just at the end of the walk to the guest house where Ender had once lived.  Soon hundreds of other whisps began to gather upon the same spot and spun with an unearthly vigor.  As the orange tornado took form a loud crack rang out and the whisps took the form of a man.  Valon Lorsha stepped forward and began striding towards the group, but something was different about him this day.<br><br>His usual black royal garb was not present and was replaced by what could be concidered casual clothing.  A brown t-shirt clung to his toned form and bore an amber colored dragon design that ran along the right side of his ribs and up onto his chest.  A pair of long jeans slid across the ground over a pair of brown running shoes.  His hair hung low like usual and danced in his face.  A pair of silver rings with onyx stone set in them graced his ring fingers and a long silver necklace bearing the symbol of Drakengrad wrapped around his neck.<br><br>"I hope I'm not intruding, but I couldn't help but notice you gathering.  Something's up, I can feel it." Valon stated in his very rehearsed tone.<br><br>Valon glanced around at the group of super powers and could almost feel the tension crushing his lungs.  Something horrid had happened or was about to happen, but what he was unsure.  The last person that Valon looked at was Nat, and her face told the whole story.  Ender's time was coming soon.  Something told him this deep in his soul.  Valon strode over to Nat and put a powerful hand on her shoulder.  His dull green eyes flashed slightly as he made eye contact with her.<br><br>"Ender has gone missing I suppose?  We'll find him...I know it.  I'm coming with you all.  I owe Ender that much." Valon whispered to Nat in an attempt to reassure her.</div></div>

The psionic looked to his side to see a car and a motorcycle touching each other in a more than friendly manner. A quick glance at the driver revealed that Terrian was the crasher.

Bravery is being willing to do horrible things so that good things happen later. Bravery would have been telling us to our faces, not scampering off and leaving us to pick up the pieces! Bravery would have been staying with us and facing whatever fate might hold for him, hand in hand! Bravery would be letting the people that he's spent his life protecting protect him for once! Just crawling off into a corner to die... That's nothing but cowardice. I called Zebedee on it when he deserted us to go hide in a cave, and I'm going to call Ender on it too."

Her forearm had one long gash that lined up with the bones underneath. "This is one example. This is all over our bodies. They manually inserted carbon reinforcements to our bones."<br><br>Rie looked up and lowered her eyelid. There was a small black dot on the bottom of her eye. "That's where they stuck the syringe to give us our super sight."<br><br>Rie parted her hair a bit. There was a scar. "That's where they stuck my phasing device. Do you know how large a psionic amplifier is compared to this?" Rie's scar was rather large as it was, stretching for about an inch.

No buildings beyond it on that block, just a guardrail. No doorways for anyone to disappear into. Had he imagined it?<br><br>He turned back to the man. "Did you see..." <br><br>But he was interrupted by a <i>thunk</i> as the man fell forward onto the hood again. He was unconscious.<br><br>"Jesus," Brogue muttered. He dragged the man over to the curb, laid his motorcycle down next to him, got back into the car, and pulled over to the side of the street. A car passing through the intersection honked at him and he jumped. Then he noticed the backpack was still in the middle of the street, leaking an unidentifiable fluid.<br><br>Brogue picked up the backpack, granted himself the authority to open it, and opened it. He fished out a fat brown envelope that looked quite thoroughly soaked, then peered into the bottom of the backpack. "Ah." The shattered pieces of two beer bottles lay in a pile. He dumped them out into the gutter, made a feeble attempt to dry out the envelope by fanning it against the wind, and returned it to the backpack.<br><br>"Hey," he said. He nudged the unconscious man a bit on the arm. "Wake up. Hey... sir. Buddy." The man lay quite still.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Light flooded the lab as Sly entered and made his way to the central bank of computers. Both Lee and Sly had staircases in their homes that lead to this same entrance at the center of the lab. In every direction white ceiling and a grass floor stretched on for miles, so far in fact that it was impossible to see the walls. Many areas of the facility had been designed with specific purposes in mind. One such area was located on the east side of the lab where a small factory built, repaired, and dismantled droids of various shape and design. <br><br>These droids were programmed to move through the lab in grids every five days. They were classified into two major groups – janitors and technicians. The janitors spent hours constantly cleaning and making sure nothing was out of place. Should they find any items eschew, or even missing, a report was immediately made and sent directly to the central computer bank. The report was then compared to all the other logs the central computers received throughout the lab. If it was determined that one of the safeties, people who Sly had deemed non-threatening, took the device an email would be dropped into Slys inbox detailing who took what. In the event that that an intruder had taken the item or no clear solution was found, the central computers would transmit directly to Slys modified blackberry.  <br><br>Technicians on the other hand dealt directly with all the andalite devices and Slys own inventions. Diagnostics, upgrades, and repairs were all carried out by these droids. If a device did not meet the minimal standards spelled out in the database it was scrapped. Once a five day cycle was finished and everything in the grid was green lighted, the droids would return to the factory for servicing before heading to the next grid. It usually took the droids four months to clear all the grids before starting back over from the beginning.<br><br>There were also two special classes of droid that built in this factory that did not like move through the grids as the others. The first were maintenance class. These worked in the central area of the lab keeping things such as bee clusters, shredders, and fuel cells stocked for Slys use at all times. They also insured that these weapons and supplies were working properly. Finally there were worker droids that pulled schematics strait from the andalite database that had been pulled into this dimension along with Sly. Seventeen of them total, they worked tirelessly building one machine after another. Once finished they would locate an empty shelf and place the device there before continuing on. A log was kept showing where items were placed should Sly need them. It had taken him a long time to set up this system, especially since it was forbidden to use AI’s due to their tendency to enter rampancy when neglected.<br><br>It was one of these devices that could possibly save Ender. As he began to telepathically link with the machines Sly found that several redundant programs had been condensed into one more efficient program. This bothered him because it was not the first time he had noticed such an occurrence since his return. For now though it would have to wait. Ender was the priority right now.<br><br>His fingers flew over the keyboard as his mind stretched out into the records of all the devices. At the same time Sly was activating sensors which were set up all over Whelkshore and its outlying areas. If Ender was still nearby or had recently teleported the sensors would pick up his signature quickly since his brainwave pattern was far more advanced than any other in Whelkshore. In fact Sly had failed to tell Ender on more than one occasion that his brainwave patterns were so advanced that they registered more as an andalite than human. <br><br>Several footsteps entering the lab told Sly the others had followed. It seemed though that a familiar pair had not followed.<br><br><i>Lee where are you going?</i><br><br>OOC – Ack, sorry for the long winded post and the poor quality of it, I typed it up while at work. Anyways I should explain this – When Slys telepathic speech (italicized) is in &lt; &gt; it means it’s normal and everyone can hear it. But when it doesn’t have anything it’s slys own thoughts. Since Lee and Sly are linked permentaly Sly can think a question and Lee can hear it. (There is also private thought speak but it’s usually clear who it’s being directed at. <br></div></div>

Because Sly's in his human appearance in Airship, and hasn't adopted his normal form yet in Triannual, so Terrian by all rights should be completely taken aback by this strange unknown creature. Also, I can't feel safe in assuming how Terrian is going to feel about Natalie and Valon by the time Triannual is over -- you know, like whether or not he would care to acknowledge their existence -- so that complicates things too. Still I will make this post as safe as possible and then possibly edit it later if inconsistencies arise.</i><br><br><br>This was now the third impossibly peculiar thing to occur to Brogue over the course of ten minutes, and he ordinarily would have -- or he had the feeling Terrian ordinarily would have, at any rate -- dealt with the shock by slipping away amid the bustle and vanishing. However, in this case, Brogue had the car, which would make his getaway much more conspicuous -- and, more importantly, he actually recognized a few of the seven people who had just apparently materialized out of thin air.<br><br>Natalie and Valon, whom he remembered altogether too well from his last visit to Cherrygrove, were flanked by three young human (human-<i>looking</i>, he thought he should correct himself) strangers, and -- as he was considerably happier to see -- Rie was with them as well. She dropped onto one knee which slammed, perhaps painfully, into the pavement, but Brogue no sooner opened his mouth to call out her name when he noticed the seventh being who had just appeared.<br><br>His first thought was "centaur", but although that would do for a general description, this creature probably wasn't what the ancient Greeks had had in mind. It had blue fur, no visible mouth, what looked like a pair of antennae, and a blade at the end of its long tail.<br><br>Brogue had an instant's leisure time to ponder whether to try for the car, abandon it and run, hide behind the enormous Jonas, or simply go insane right where he was standing, before a thought struck him. It wasn't his.<br><br><i>&lt;Terrian?&gt;</i><br><br>Brogue took a step back. That wasn't the original Terrian's thought. Obviously not, since Terrian wouldn't send that thought to Brogue -- but, more to the point, that wasn't Terrian's voice. That wasn't <i>his</i> voice. It was deeper and colder. In truth, it sounded almost familiar to Brogue, but it seemed slightly garbled, like a radio with interference, and he couldn't recognize it.<br><br>Brogue knew of one person with proper telepathy -- not the restricted form Terrian and the duplicates could employ among themselves -- but that person wasn't here, and if Ender had wanted to contact him from elsewhere, he ought to have been able to pinpoint the original Terrian. Brogue supposed, therefore, that this person was one of those seven who had just appeared.<br><br>He looked at Rie again. He knew she had similar powers to Ender, but -- no, it wasn't her voice, that was immediately plain. He looked around again.<br><br>The centaur-like creature was staring directly at him.<br><br>Well. Brogue was absolutely positive that Terrian had never seen anything like <i>that</i> before. What was -- ? But he was frantic and confused enough as it was. He decided to try to fix this instead of only making it worse.<br><br>He couldn't respond to the thought telepathically, since it clearly hadn't come from Terrian or another duplicate, so he said aloud, quite clearly:<br><br>"A duplicate."<br><br><br><i>OOC - Man, I was expecting this post to be short and throwaway. Crap. Now I really don't want to have to retcon it later. Bulbs, can we just make a pact here and now that Terrian won't see Sly in his Andalite form in either Airship or Triannual?</i></div></div>

I’m Sly, from the airship. I never explained I was a shape shifter.</i>&gt;<br><br>Sly would have continued on explaining about his ability to morph but his handheld scanner had started beeping. Lists of data were scrolling along the screen and despite having no mouth, it was clear the results were unsettling. Jonas, taking interest in the device Sly was using, had lumbered over to try and get a better look.<br><br>“Nifty little do-hickey. Id it one of dem iPhones?” Jonas asked completely unbothered by Sly’s appearance, “I had a iPhone, but I rewired it ta make a processor fer my bikes’ GPS.<br><br>Sly cast a glance at Jonas then went back to what he was doing, &lt;<i>I hate to sound rude but please, for the time being, don’t bother me.</i>&gt;<br><br>Jonas shrugged and turned to look at the rest of the group.

Mia edged closer to Rick, who had moved over towards Terrian. <br><br>“Hi, my name’s Rick. Looks like you have met my father before,” the mage said as he motioned back towards Sly, “He’s not purposely ignoring you, but there’s an urgent matter right now he needs to focus on. You’re names Terrian right?”<br><br>&lt;<i>Trace amounts of skin cells and DNA, as well as the remnants of a fading teleportation field.

It was clear that he was not presenting everything the scanner had revealed but it was all he was going to say, though there was a good chance that the information would find its way into Lee’s head regardless of Sly’s will. The andalite turned and face Terrian again &lt;<i>You haven’t seen Ender have you? It’s very important we find him soon.

Sly immediatiately responded, messing with a small device resembling a cellphone that he had reached for the moment Zebedee had requested technical assistance.<br><br>&lt;You're all good.

Numbers skyrocketted and then plunged to the bottom of the scale, and teleport signatures began appearing all over the city at a phenomenal rate, almost like an army was teleporting into the city. Green lights began flickering all around the group, looking like flames burning away about three feet off the ground. A quiet hum accompanied them, like the noise of power flowing through high tension wires.Jonas, even from his lofty height, could see the sea of fire stretching to the horizon. A pale verdant glow was cast over the group, the light from the eminations overwhelming even that of the sun.<br><br>"Testing... One, two, three. Testing." Zebedee's voice emerged from the center of each of the glows, echoing all about as far as the group could comprehend. <br><br>"What... the... ****?" Natalie growled, glaring at the display. She reached out her hand, passing through one of the fireballs harmlessly.<br><br>"This might be a little loud, but such precautions are neccessary to ensure we get the full attention of specific parties." Zebedee droned, his voice affecting boredom. A moment later, the group was deafened as a crack of thunder sharply cut through the morning air, seemingly surrounding them on all sides, and rolling out over the countryside. As the intense echoes began dying down, Zebedee spoke again.<br><br>"Anyways, sorry for the disruption, everybody. This may be a matter of life and death for some of us, but I understand you all being upset about me interupting your daily lives. Again, I apologize." Zebedee's tone was as appeasing as could be managed for somebody who had just essentially thrown a firecracker into every single room in the entire city.<br><br>"Back to the point. Anyways, a friend of mine, though I will not state his real name, is about to do something really, really stupid. I'm not saying that it's really bad that he wants to have some peace to himself, but I do wish that he would at least stop by, and actually say good bye to the people that will miss him. If he doesn't... Well, it's best to make amends while you still can. And if this friend truly wants to rest peacefully, that's clearly in everybody's best interests. So, anyways, if you do listen to me, I'll see you around. If not... Uh... I guess, goodbye, good luck, and God bless." Zebedee's voice faded out and the flames flickered away. A moment later, Zebedee appeared on his hands and knees beside the group, panting for breath. Green sparks cascaded to the pavement and then flickered away like snowflakes in one's grasp.<br></div></div>

The biker's name was Shawn Martin, "postal technician", and his leg wasn't behaving just the way biological legs usually did. The hulking one had come out from below, in the sewers, and his name was Jonas. The centaur was, indeed, Sly, who it seemed was a shapeshifter.

He’ll make certain of that.</i>&gt; <br><br>Sly helped Lee to his feet and, like the others, waited. Whether they were proven champions of this world or simply the new guys no longer mattered. In this situation they were all the same, unable to do anything more but wait and hope. <br><br>After what felt like hours their attempts had still gone unanswered. Rick was setting on the curb near where the wreck had been. Mia had joined him but the events of the night had exhausted her. Now, her head rest on Ricks shoulder, she desperately fought a losing battle against sleep. <br><br>Jonas, one of the newcomers, hadn’t really been sure what to do. Silence and patience weren’t really his best attributes; in fact they weren’t really attributes he had at all. He now stooped over the smashed-up motorcycle, fixing parts as he came to them. Despite his limited tools and the extent of the damage he had made quite a bit of head way and would more than likely have the vehicle fixed by morning if he kept his current pace. <br><br>Sly was near Lee, whom he had been silently speaking with since they had began waiting. They loved Ender; he had been like another son to Sly and a brother to Lee. But there were issues that would need to be taken care of in the likely event that Ender held steadfast with his intentions. It was mainly out of concern for the others that they kept this discussion between the two of them, though partially out of fear of Nat or Rie’s reactions to such a discussion. <br><br>Eventually Sly moved those still waiting to his own home by expanding the field on his teleport watch. Mia now rested comfortably in Rick’s old bed and had been sound asleep for hours. Downstairs, where all the carpets had been replaced with grass floors, was where the others had gathered. <br><br>Sly was making breakfast for everyone as dawn rapidly approached. As he stirred the gravy one of his stalk-eyes looked over the counter and into the living room. Rick sat on one end of the sofa as he flipped through channels on the tv. He never lingered on one for more than a few seconds and didn’t seem to really be looking for anything in particular. In the middle of the couch sat Lee – eyes closed and head bowed. On the other end of the couch resided Nat who had continually been shifting her sitting position for an hour. It didn’t surprise Sly that she was restless; she was a warrior like him. The andalite had learned to cope with times like these long ago but Nat was still young and unfortunately would have more times like this to teach her the patience required.<br><br>Over in an arm chair was Rie, asleep. Though she hadn’t made a sound since they arrived back, Sly had noticed her cheeks were tear stained when he draped a blanket over her. Terrian was around somewhere though Sly wasn’t sure where. It was possible he was outside overseeing Jonas as the rotund man continued to work on fixing the other man's motorcycle. <br><br>OOC – So yeah I’m not sure how we should end this, but it deserves a better ending then were we all left it. <br></div></div>

Let's say Demitri's motorcycle got a little smashed up instead, to justify Jonas working on something in the garage. Also, a bit of Jonas and Demitri autoing, sorry.</i><br><br>The rising sun cast a silvery light on Terrian's car in Sly's driveway. He had declined to teleport, primarily so he wouldn't leave behind the car; it had been all he could do to find his rental again the last time he'd visited Whelkshore. Also partially because teleportation kind of made him nauseous, as he'd discovered during that previous visit. He'd given Shawn Martin, postal technician of the Whelkshore, a lift, along with his sopping backpack. Now the two of them stood in Sly's garage, watching Jonas patch up Shawn's bike.<br><br>"'At'll just about do 'er, I tink," Jonas said, and turned to Terrian. "Yer lucky yer car din't get bashed none, mister."<br><br>"Yeah, it's..." Terrian broke off as Shawn Martin's head drooped and he fell to the garage floor with a clatter.<br><br>"Oh wow," said Terrian. "So you -- you thought you'd better clock out again, huh? Here." And he tried to lift the fainted Shawn up, but the man was heavier than he'd expected, especially around the legs. This made sense to Terrian in a dimly horrifying way.<br><br>"Need a hand?" Jonas asked, and he was there in a second to help lift Shawn, which would have been just fine if one of Shawn Martin's pant legs hadn't rolled up, displaying a glint of metal.<br><br>"Oh -- the bike!" Terrian gasped, and he kicked the motorcycle's stand loose with one deft heel. Shawn's motorcycle fell against the far wall with an even greater clatter, knocking down a ladder, a rake, and other possessions of Sly's. Jonas hurriedly turned around to set things right, which gave Terrian the chance to sit the comatose Shawn down on a lawn chair and investigate his ankles.<br><br>They were robotic. Terrian gently rolled one of the pant legs further up. Robotic at least as far as the knee. Without a word, he rolled the cloth back down to the postal technician's shoes and set about helping Jonas.<br><br>"Some mess 'ere, hah?" Jonas said cheerfully.<br><br>Terrian stood the rake back up against the wall. "Yeah, it's--" And that was when he was cut off by the sound of Natalie's voice from upstairs.<br><br><i>"I really don't feel like dicking around with lardo, coma guy, and that little backstabber!"</i><br><br>Terrian's face flushed. He let go of the rake and stepped back, looking stupidly up at the ceiling.<br><br><i>"Hey, if they heard me, all the better. They aren't welcome around here, and they should know it!"</i><br><br>Terrian's eyes turned to Jonas, who was already looking back at him. Evidently the man had been applying process of elimination to figure out which person in the garage was the little backstabber.<br><br>Terrian felt uncomfortably hot. He sidestepped the motorcycle and backed out of the garage. "You know what, I think I..." He looked over at Shawn Martin, who was still happily unconscious. "I'm just going to take off. Tell him no hard feelings about the crash, whenever he wakes up."<br><br>He waved to Jonas, who had forgotten to put down the ladder, and moved out onto the driveway and into the pale dawn. He had opened the front door of his car and stepped inside when he heard another cry from inside the house, not one of Natalie's. This speaker he recognized as the one who had made the magnified announcement, although Terrian didn't know his name.<br><br><i>"Ender!"</i><br><br>Terrian stopped short with his seatbelt halfway to the buckle. He sat there with the car door still open, looking up at Sly's house, feeling the blood still rushing to his cheeks. <i>Good timing,</i> he thought miserably.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Nat’s hair skewed slightly as a small burst of air abruptly rushed passed her cheek. Immediately she realized that several inches of Sly’s tail-blade had buried itself in the fridge just centimeters from her face. The andalite continued to stir the gravy as though everything was normal. Of his four eyes, his main two were overseeing breakfast preparations, his right stalk-eye watched over the events in the living room, and the left was staring directly at Nat.<br><br>&lt;<i>At a time like this, do you really wanna push those around you away?</i>&gt;<br><br>-<br><br>Jonas slouched on the car, causing the vehicle to sag horribly close to the ground. He looked at the entrance to the house and then at Terrian. <br><br>“You suppose dat’s da fella’ dey been lookin’ fer?” he asked. <br><br>OOC: I figure hit or miss on when Ender may reply again.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"At a time like this? Yeah. I don't really need all the pissing and moaning and fanfare that we're going to get," Natalie rocked to her feet, seemingly not even noticing Sly's tail, and started to walk back across the living room again.<br><br>"This keeps happening... One of us goes away, we all get sad, then they come back and we all get happy again. I'm tired of this whole useless cycle. I've lost everybody in this room-" Natalie turned to cast a glare at Rie. "That I care about at least once. And you all keep coming back."<br><br>Stalking to the edge of the room, Nat shoved a small desk out of the way effortlessly.<br><br>"It's not worth getting emotionally invested in any of this any more. It just hurts everybody who bothers. So tell me, fellows... Why should I care? Because it might be the last time that I see people I love? Because death can come at any moment?"<br><br>"Natalie! You know full well-" Zebedee began to say, only to be cut off by said desk flying by his head.<br><br>"SHUT. UP. Don't tell me how to handle this. You did the 'go disappear for a while and make everybody sad' thing too! Do you know how much Thyra cried about that? Do you have any-- ****ing-- CLUE?"<br><br>Zebedee shrank back, collapsing back onto the couch. His sorrowful smile from earlier had collapsed upon itself, now twisted into some kind of warped grimace. He tried to look up for a moment, but immediately went back to covering his eyes. Tears ran down his arms.<br><br>"The only way to not get hurt by you people is to never actually care about any of you in the first place. I wanted to, but it seems that I can't count on you all for anything. I'm always the one left holding the fort, waiting for you all to come back safe and sound. I'm <i>sick</i> of it. SICK!" Natalie moved as if to throw a punch, glanced around herself, and realized that she had no target for her rage. She simply growled wordlessly, and then marched towards the door.<br><br>"Get out of my way, Ender. I'm just gonna ****ing go home and go to bed," Natalie didn't look up to talk to him face to face, her fists clenched tightly at her sides. Her mouth was locked into a frown, the right corner twitching slightly.</div></div>

Nah, I got a couple months, I just wanted some ti-" <br><br>And suddenly Nat was screaming at Sly and Zeb and everyone. The psychic watched the events unfold, his forced facial expression faltering as he realized what exactly he had put his friends through. He hated himself even more because on some level, he knew it would happen. He didn't have to be psychic to have known it.<br><br>"Get out of my way, Ender. I'm just gonna ****ing go home and go to bed."<br><br>As she made for the door, Ender grabbed her by the arm.<br><br>"Ender, what the FUCK do you think you're doing?"

Rick had joined his father and the two were staring at the kiss Ender was currently giving Natalie.<br><br>“You owe me twenty dollars dad,” Rick said in a low voice. <br><br>Sly nodded in acknowledgement, &lt;<i>Leave it to the interdimensional extraterrestrial to lose a bet about human nature.</i>&gt;<br></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Natalie's hands immediately went up, bracing against Ender's chest as he approached her. She had only started to shove him away when their lips met, and she ceased at that moment. Clasping her fingers into the fabric of his coat, she pulled herself closer to him. Her eyes drifted shut, and for a while, she ignored the world around her. Shifting her grip, she slid her arms around Ender, and broke the kiss off, pulling him into a tight hug. She let her head rest on his shoulder for a moment, sighed, and then drew back.<br><br>"Really, I knew it was going to be this way," Natalie murmured, meeting his gaze. She slipped out of his grasp, her hands trailing along his arms until they were only touching his fingertips.<br><br>"I didn't want it, though... At least not now, not that we know what's waiting for you-" Natalie gulped, and then resumed talking.<br><br>"I've lost friends. I said it earlier... I've lost each and every one of you. I can survive that," her voice was strong, steady.<br><br>"But... This is something new. What exactly are you- Are <i>we</i> now? What exactly is it that I'm going to end up losing? This isn't just the passing of a friend, since about two minutes ago," Natalie released her hold on his fingertips, and turned away from him. Her head hung low, her ponytail mostly slipping free of the hair tie.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Just don't think about what you're going to lose. Think about what you've gained," Ender said. He approached Nat and put his arms around her. Her body felt warm against his, and he almost thought she was shaking. The boy leaned his head against the girl's, inhaling the combination of shampoo and sweat from worry in her hair. He held her even tighter.<br><br>"I'm still here right now," Ender whispered. As he spoke, his shades slowly floated off his face and folded up before falling into his pocket.<br><br>------------<br><br>Rie had woken up to all the yelling moments earlier. She had kept her eyes closed and her breathing regular the entire time, not wanting to fully wake up and see that her closest and only friend was back. She had said her goodbye once, why would she want to say it again?</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Terrian gave in. He let go of the seatbelt buckle and got back out of the car. Without a gesture of either invitation or prohibition to Jonas, he crossed the lawn and walked up to the front porch. The door was open. Terrian lifted his bad foot to take the first step onto the porch, looking into the house. At the far end of the hall, Ender and Natalie were embracing. And... there was the kiss. <br><br>In this split-second, Terrian's foot seemed to lose all its weight. He tread on the wooden porch before he could stop himself, but, blessedly, without making a sound. With arms flailing idiotically, he dropped off to the side of the porch and hid against a hedge before anyone inside noticed him.<br><br>He remembered the duplicate on the night of the Fascere fiasco, chastising him for being "wishy-washy". Here he was again, ducking away out of sight instead of taking any initiative. He honestly wanted to join Ender and the others; it might be his last chance to see the psion, and he felt there ought to be <i>some</i> kind of closure between them. But Natalie... There was just no facing Natalie. He would simply screw up whatever good mood she managed to land herself in. There: that was a pretty unsophisticated way to put it, but so it was.<br><br>And Ender and Natalie had just kissed. And now they were speaking softly together. And the idea of going in there and talking to Ender while Natalie hung on his shoulder and stared daggers at Terrian, honestly, put a mildly sickly turn in his stomach. So he sat and waited.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">As Jonas ambled up, he saw Terrian lose his balance and, with arms flailing about, fall of the porch near the hedge. <br><br>“Ha! Ya lose yer footin’ der fella?” <br><br>He laughed and reached down with his meaty hand and delicately lifted Terrian by the scruff of his neck. Still holding the multi-man in his hand, Jonas squeezed the two of them through the door. Once again, his body seemed to compress and spill through in the same way a mouse fits through a space much smaller that itself. <br><br>“Well, I guess you mus’ be Ender!” Jonas inquired, “Call me Jonas, nice ta finally meet ya.”<br><br>As he introduced himself, Jonas made large sweeping motion with his hands, nearly smashing Terrian into the ceiling. Realizing he hadn’t sat his new friend down yet Jonas gingerly placed him down in front of him.<br><br>“Sorry, bout’ dat.” Jonas laughed sheepishly. <br></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Oh. Awkward," Ender mumbled into Nat's ear. It was inevitable that someone or something would ruin the moment. The psychic just didn't think that the distraction would come so soon. He had half a mind to teleport Natalie and himself to some more secluded location, but he had enough running for a day. Instead, Ender quickly released Nat from his embrace and turned to face the booming voice. His glasses teleported back onto his face before anyone could see his eyes.<br><br>"Yep, I'm Ender. Nice to meet you," Ender extended a hand and firmly, yet nonchalantly, gripped the giant's. He nodded at the other. "Hey Terrian."</div></div>

She brushed his hand away, but maintained the eye contact for another moment. The pain in Ender's eyes... Was it for himself? Unlikely. It seemed almost like he was pleading.<br><br><i>Don't let your own issues with other people drag him down at a time like this, Natalie. </i> The words weren't in her head. They weren't Ender or Sly talking. It was her own voice, her own heart. If this was the way things were going to be, she actually had to care about somebody. Heck, with a fellow like Ender, that might mean that she had to care about <b>everybody</b>.<br><br>She cleared her throat, brushed at the corner of her eyes, and turned to face the doorway.<br><br>"Terrian. Um... Big guy. Sorry about, well, you guys know. All of the screaming and name calling earlier," Nat brought her hands up behind her head, quickly repairing the ponytail's structure. That'd keep her hands occupied for now. She could greet people now, but handshaking with a stranger and the man that had shot her without warning? Baby steps for now.<br><br>"The name's Nat.

He even managed to look Natalie in the eye. "What name calling?" Before Jonas had the chance to look at him in confusion, Terrian nudged the larger man lightly in the elbow. "I didn't hear anything."<br><br>He couldn't resist adding, still looking levelly at Natalie: "I hope you didn't call me a dunderhead or a nincompoop. I hate those. They're my least favorite thing to be called."<br><br>Then he reached out a hand to Ender. "Good to see you again, man.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">“Yeah. It is good to see you again.” Ender smiled.<br><br>- A few months later -<br><br>He didn't want to be buried. He didn't want to leave a body behind that Genlab could find. His body was cremated in Sly's lab the day after Rie found him unresponsive in his bed. His hair had become thin and gray; his face lines spread across it. His muscles stopped absorbing the vitamins and minerals that they used to, going down to standard human levels. He didn't die frail, but he definitely wasn't as strong as he used to be. His mind never faded. <br><br>Burning the body at 'normal' temperatures didn't get rid of his bones, though. Rie had been the one to put the body in the furnace, and had even been the one to turn it on. But she couldn't bring herself to turn up the temperature. At the revelation that the oven wasn't hot enough, her eye twitched almost imperceptibly. There was almost a tear.<br><br>The group had been in the lab for the first funeral, but felt they needed something a little more official. Ender had no final requests for his ashes. He had never been one for the spotlight, so it was obvious that he didn't want a public funeral. Ender also probably wouldn't want to be kept around in a jar.<br><br>The following Monday, Rie took the urn and walked to Zebedee's house. She phased through the door and made her way to Nat's room. She knocked.<br><br>When Nat opened the door, Rie's eyes were still changing from pink to white. They changed faster than normal, but not fast enough to eliminate all traces of crying.<br><br>“What do you think about launching Ender into space?”<br></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Sly gathered up his tools for the fifth time and rearranged them. This time he tried arranging them by size. Before that he had cleaned his ship twice, run the diagnostic test on his virtual reality gear three consecutive times, and even made plans to research a new vegetable hybrid. <br><br>“Dad,” Rick’s voice came from the doorway, “You need to come upstairs.”<br><br>The andalite turned a stalk-eye towards his son, &lt;<i>I told you I’m fine. I’m just… I’m just experiencing some emotional feed back from the mind-meld with Lee. Now that Ender’s gone…</i>&gt;<br><br>For a moment, Sly did nothing before looking down at his tools and picking them up for a sixth time. Rick crossed the lab and put a hand on his fathers shoulder.<br><br>“Look, you’re acting like you did after mom died. It’s all right dad, Ender was a good friend and we’ve known him for a while. Human emotions or not, you cared about him like the rest of us.”<br><br>Sly put the tools down and grabbed the edge of the counter. &lt;<i>It’s my fault. If I could just ascertained how I keep coming back to life I might have been able to save him. I might have been able to save a lot of people…</i>&gt;<br><br>“No, don’t even think that. Science can’t fix everything Dad. You said it yourself, one day you’re going to die and you won’t come back either.”<br><br>&lt;<i>It’s the way of things… No one is meant to live forever...</i>&gt;<br><br>“See, now come on. Jonas said he was gonna leave today, but I’ve been talking to him and I don’t think he has anywhere to go. Maybe you should have a talk with him.”<br><br>Sly nodded, &lt;<i>You’re right. Lets go talk to Jonas.</i>&gt;<br><br>As the two were leaving, Sly’s stalk-eye looked back at his desk. Ender’s laptop was still sitting partially opened with a strange black tear drying near it on the desk. It was the second time since coming to this dimension that Sly had cried. The stalk-eye turned back around as they exited the lab. <br><br>OOC: Personally, I think it would be cool if Andalites shed black tears. <br><br>This should allow Sly a good exit from the topic. I figure he’ll be needed again for the rocket but that way once that’s over Sly is effectively done. <br></div></div>

She rolled over, revealing the tear streaked fabric, and kicked her feet to the floor. She paused for a moment, sitting with her hands limply at her side, and then brought them up to wipe at her face.<br><br>"I guess..." She stood up, putting a hand on the lid of the urn. She gently traced its contours with her fingertips, a sigh escaping her lips.<br><br>"There really isn't much good to keeping 'him' around here, is there? I guess he probably would be best off... being free, out of where he's been shackled all of these years," Nat let her hand slowly drop, falling limply to her side again.<br><br>"I wonder how much happier he would have been, had we just left this world behind. Took a space ship from Sly, left all the fighting and pain back here on earth. You two coulda been free, no more of those other experiments or whatever following you..." Natalie fell back onto the couch, her body without its natural tension, its constant energy. Another sigh parted her lips.<br><br>"Coulda, woulda, and shoulda. My mom always called those the triplets that like to hang around after anything bad happened. I guess the come around when something absolutely horrible happens too, huh?" Nat let her eyes close again, almost as if she was trying to go to sleep.<br><br>"I'm sorry Rie... Ender..."</div></div>

"Or maybe something that we would just <i>want</i> to fight."<br><br>Rie took a couple steps into the room, gauged Natalie's response, and decided that she wasn't unwelcome. She made her way to the couch and at on its arm clutching Ender's urn tightly.<br><br>"There's nothing to be sorry about. He was happy with what he got." Rie smiled at Nat for a brief moment before turning her gaze to a blank wall, her face going back to a neutral expression. "Earth wasn't a prison. Just a... game, I guess. I only think we should launch him because he would want to go out in style. I don't know what he actually wanted. He was the mind reader, not me."<br><br>Rie looked down at the urn in her lap. "Even if we wanted to escape the other experiments, he wouldn't want to run away when his friends were in danger."<br><br>The girl sat silently for a moment before getting up. "Come. Let's get the others."<br><br>***<br><br>Rie had gone straight to Sly's. She seemed to have walked in on a conversation involving Rick, Jonas, and Sly, but she didn't particularly care. Only thoughtful melancholy kept her quiet until the end of the conversation.<br><br>***<br><br>It only took about half an hour to find a rocket. It took another half hour to set it up in Zebedee's backyard. The device was small and sleek, about the size of a model rocket from a hobby store, yet able to deliver half the payload of a conventional human space shuttle. It was something completely expected from Andalite technology.<br><br>The rocket had a small hatch open in the side, and Ender's urn was clearly visible inside. Rie sat from a distance, staring intently at the silver object. Strange that someone who could touch the mind of any person and any machine on Earth and beyond could fit in such a small place.<br><br>The girl was vaguely aware of the others roaming about the backyard. Zebedee was knelt in prayer near the urn. Sly was losing himself at a computer display, finalizing the proper trajectories over and over again for the rocket. Nat simply paced back and forth at the edge of Rie's peripheral vision. There may have been others, but they weren't in the girl's line of sight.<br><br>Enough time. Rie stood up, not bothering to brush the grass off her pants. It would be best to get this over with. Quickly. Just like the first time. The girl almost wavered as she made her way to the rocket. Memories flooded into her mind, and they were brushed away with blankness as quickly as they had formed. <br><br>Silently, she closed the hatch and made sure it was locked. This was enough to tell everyone to back away. Sly initiated a count down before disconnecting the computer and walking off. The rocket seemed to understand this, as it had begun counting aloud.<br><br>“Ten seconds to launch. Please clear the area. Eight seconds. Seven.”<br><br>Rie was the last to back off to the designated “safe” zone. Her eyes didn't break contact with the device. She didn't want to turn around, so instead she just slowly stepped backwards. Five seconds left. The rocket's fusion engine had ignited, indicated by the bright, almost blinding glow at the device's exhaust nozzle. At this point she probably should have turned around to sprint away, but she didn't want to. She continued stepping back slowly.<br><br>“What the hell are you doing?” Rie was vaguely aware of Nat's voice.<br><br>“Three,” the computerized voice said. Nat was running towards the girl this point.<br><br>“Two.” Rie... smiled. She was still stepping back, but she was still too far inside the blast radius.<br><br>“One. Blast off engaged.” <br><br>“Goodbye, Ender,” Rie said. The rocket's engine completely ignited. Fire and smoke forced its way from the bottom of the machine, forcing it up towards the sky. The dangerous wave of energy traveled across the ground, scarring the grass. Traveling towards Rie.<br><br>As the fire nearly engulfed the girl, Nat tackled her from behind. This snapped the ghost out of her trance and turned her basic survival instincts back on. She phased Nat and herself out of the current plane so that they would both fall into the ground, safe from the fire above.<br><br>A moment later, the two emerged from the charred earth, with Rie pulling the still ethereal Nat behind her. They phased back to the physical plane. Nat promptly slapped Rie in the face, hard enough to knock her to the ground. “What the hell were you doing?!?”<br><br>Rie looked up, watching the rocket's bright ascent. She then looked back at Nat, the hint of a smile on her face fading back to a lack of expression. “Nothing.”<br><br>OOC: In retrospect, burning Zebedee's grass was a bad call. Oh well. We're done here. I think I'll lock this. If anyone has a burning (lulz) desire to reply after this, PM me first.</div></div>
