        <div class="content"><div class="message">OOC: THE EVER PHEARED ROAD TRIP! Though personally, I think I'm gonna make it feel like Doctor Dolittle. Minus the talking animals. You know, a nautical voyage of wonder with an eclectic cast.<br><br>BIC: He shouldn't have said yes. Sure, it was magically harder than diamond, theoretically. In that same vein, it should have been impossible to shatter. However, he had proven most misfortunate in that regard.<br><br>Miko sat still on the incredibly battered couch of the Summoner alliance, head in his hands. His shattered golden hatchet lie in dozens of pieces on the almost equally damaged coffee table. When Hector had asked him if he could borrow the hatchet to chop firewood, Miko had naturally assumed that all would be fine. Unfortunately, when Hector said "Chop" and "Firewood", he meant "Slay a gargantuan dragon with incredibly sturdy armor."<br><br>The hatchet, most unfortunately, had not survived the process. Hector, most unfortunately, had. Miko extended his fingers over the wreck, again, trying to knit it back together. It was of no use. His use of Jade Magic, though powerful, had slowly coaxed him away from the traditional Summoner Magicks. He had lost their aptitude with rock and steel.<br><br>This meant only one thing. To get another suitable weapon, he'd need to revisit the South Pole, and find his way down into the caverns beneath it. That'd be a journey of thousands of miles, and with Helen currently unnaccounted for, he'd need to do it by either summon, or by boat.<br>--------<br>Miko had begun walking down the road to the docks. He had just said his goodbyes to his family, and informed the other summoners and allies of his mission. If anybody chose to join him, he wouldn't object in the least. This was a trivial mission of sorts, but he needed a new weapon. It was vital to his craft. Miko looked up at the afternoon sun. He'd be away for a long time, no doubt.<br></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">A young elf appeared at the docks. Obviously female from the judgement on the beautiful curves and the shape of the jaw structure. Long golden blonde hair flowed to the bottom of her thighs, with two braided strands of bangs were then tied to the back to give it a crown look. She was wearing a celestial white outfit, in the shape of a long dress and ruffles that would go from the shoulders and travel behind the neck. This was obvious either a magnus or a female mage look. She was also wearing a hood that tied around front and had a little cape drape from it making her look as if she had been traveling far. <br><br>In her right hand was a white oak staf with a warped ball at the end, it seemed to be carved to give it a very natural tangled look. In the center of the tangles was a blue crystal ball which gave off a faint glow. If observed carefully you could see a golden colored bow with a jewelled encrusted quiver which seemed to hold only three arrows, all tipped with diamonds. <br><br>In her left hand was a book, it had a picture of a naked angel. The wings and feathers covering the most crucial parts of her body but leaving the rest exposed. To any normal human it would look as if it were a mere normal book, but to the keen eye you could tell there was some sort of magic brewing inside of its parchment.<br><br>The elf spotted Miko, and seeing someone who resembled something of her nature she deicded to introduce herself. "Good afternoon sir, My name is Celestia I come from a far elfen country in search of a powerful weapon to aid myself as well as my beast. Also I heard a myth, that one with this magic crystal handed down in my family, you could hold a maximum of three beasts.... Judging from your face I can tell that you have much knowledge in this area, no?"</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">The ship swayed as it held its position in port. Rick looked over the side of the ship and ran his fingers through his think blue hair. He wore the usual black combat boats and blue cargo jeans with a black dress shirt. Over all this was a plain black traveling cloak that looked slightly worn out. The mage would have looked rather dashing if it had not been for the sour look on his face.<br><br>“Rick,” said a soft voice behind him, “The Captain says this is the port. He won’t stay for long because he’s afraid of the summoners, so we need to hurry or he’ll leave us.”<br><br>Rick turned around and looked at Mia, “The summoners are not good people and I can’t understand why Shin-Ra would be in contact with them.”<br><br>Mia’s nose wrinkled slightly as she scowled at him. “The summoners are a good people who have been oppressed just like the mages. They are not any different that us!”<br><br>Rick felt his body heat rising, “Then tell me why the Captain of this boat is afraid of them!”<br><br>“They’re just misunderstood. Just like our people.” Mia pleaded.<br><br>“They’re nothing like us!” Rick said a little louder than he should have then turned away from her. He heard her shoes stomping across the boat as she walked away from him. Rick took a deep breath and tried to calm himself down. It wasn’t her fault, the Mages had lived confined within Shin-Ra for some time and their only contacts were the Elementals and the Summoners. But Rick had seen the destruction at Slateport he knew who had committed the atrocity. <br><br>Rick heard more stomping and turned to see Mia with the chest they had brought floating behind her. She ignored him and continued off the ship. Rick walked off after her and was about to try and talk to her when she said, “Miko! I wasn’t told you’d be meeting us at the docks. It’s quite an honor that you would come out of your way for us.” She curtseyed and slightly nodded her head.<br><br>Rick on the other hand remained motionless and stared at Miko. His eyes didn’t waver or blink and gave off the distinct impression of disgust and hatred. Rick stood ready for whatever the summoner would do. <br><br> <br></div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Hello. Pleased to meet you, Celestia. My name is Miko, and I take it that you already know the rest." He extended a hand in greeting, and then gently took the crystal from her. "I must say that I'm rather familiar with the field, but not with this specific line of workmanship. It appears to be VERY similar to beads used by my people to summon and control beasts, but from what you said, and what I can tell on my own, it is substantially larger than our normal beads, much more aesthetically pleasing, and can hold three times as many."<br><br>"Do you have any idea of the ritual to add beasts to this crystal's hold? If so, I'd be a lot more help to you on identifying its exact nature." Miko said, handing it back to Celestia.<br><br>As he reached the docks, he noted the ship before him. He appraised it with his eyes as he drew near.<br><br>"Of course I'd be willing to go out of my way to meet such good friends of my people. Your assistance is most appreciated." Miko said, bowing low with regal bearings. He rose again, sweeping his arms out to the sides, and then clenched his hands into fists. With a swift motion and a shower of sparks, he brought his knuckles together. A large tree sprung up beneath his feet, the boughs jutting outwards at the exact right angel to extend over the bow of the ship. Miko lept down to the deck, being sure to twirl his cape as elegantly as possible.<br><br>"How far is this ship going to the south, anyways? My contacts with you were rather shakey." Miko muttered disdainfully glaring to his left. Joseph was sprawled on the deck, smelling rather significantly of alchohol.<br><br>"Only way I knew the boat was here was because Joseph wasn't passed out in any of his usual haunts. Y'know, floor, couch, table, etc."</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">bulbaboy</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Mia quickly leapt onto her enchanted truck and it lifted itself up into the air after Miko. Rick stubbornly floated into the air after her and was glad that he could fly under his own power because the adoring look Mia gave Miko made Rick want to push her off into the icy water. They landed on the deck and stared confused at the drunk that seemed to appear from nowhere. <br><br>Mia answered Miko when he spoke, “As far south as you need to go. The mages of Shin-Ra have paid for everything in the hopes of our peoples continued friendship.”<br><br>Rick stood by himself and glared at everyone on the ship. He didn’t know most of them but the fact that they all seemed rather friendly with Miko was enough to make him dislike them all. <br><br>OOC- Rick is so Emo.<br></div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">albatrosstrevelyan</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Celestia smiled as she extended her arms out and two angelic wings made of pure energy appeared, the billowed outward and even had small feathers float to the ground and then dissapear as they hit the ground. She jumped and with one flap of her gigantic, yet absolutely beautiful wings she landed next to Miko. She sprawled her wings out, and they too dissappeared much like the feathers that hit the ground. <br><br>"I am so excited to fight, I just cant wait!" Celestia said with an odd voice of excitement.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Loogs</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">OOC: Make that two drunkies.<br><br>"I am in some seriously deep shit, huh."<br><br>Hector stared blankly at the summoners, a bare stick in one hand and the shattered remains of a hatchet in the other. Vathale merely sighed, shaking her head.<br><br>"Well, this is why we don't fight under the influence. I hope you realize that you're going to go on that trip now, whether you like it or not." Vathale turned away, very disappointed in her husband. "You had many other swords you could have used..."<br><br>"Will you stop blaming me?! Okay, okay, I'll go on the goddamn trip." Hector gathered a few essentials--clothing, swords, several bottles of vodka--and carried them out to the dock in a suitcase. He turned around and saw Pleiades, now two years old, waddling clumsily towards him with her arms outstretched. Hector smiled, set his bag down, and accepted her hug. "Sorry, kid, I can't take ya. This is a really long, dangerous trip. Stay home and keep mommy company, okay?"<br><br>"But mommy's coming, too." Vathale walked over to the dock with a suitcase full of clothing and other miscellaneous things in one hand and her rapier in the other. Her short, black hair tossed about in the breeze as she breathed in some of it and smiled. "I'm not about to become some damsel in distress who stays home all the time while her prince does all the fighting, huh?"<br><br>"Yeah, yeah, sure. Guess this means Pleiades is coming with us after all." He scooped her up in one arm, and set her gently on his shoulders. The little girl clapped and cheered with utter glee before holding on tightly to his head. "Sooooo... where are we going again?"<br><br>OOC: Yay I'm out of hibernation! =D</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Thank you. I appreciate the gesture of friendship and will do my best to assist your people on any occasion." Miko said formally with a smile.<br><br>"Hopefully we won't have much combat along the way. I've heard tales of pirates and sea monsters and such, but for the most part, I presume them to simply be exageration and fancy." Miko said clearly, and then almost choked when he saw Hector.<br><br>"I hope that you all are packed well. We are going to Antarctica, and we will not be using the boat for firewood." Miko took a sideways glance at Hector. "Not even the furniture."<br><br>"With that said, I think we're about ready to head out."<br></div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">albatrosstrevelyan</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Celestia shivered internally "Sounds frigid, I best use my winter jacket" She smiled sweetly, and waited for them to begin their journey on-ward to the--waste land.  </div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Clicker</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Isabelle had been walking down around the docks for hours, looking for a ride to any place other than the miserable city she was presently chained to. She happened upon a midsize craft with a rather energetic meeting on the deck. Most of the people seemed unfamiliar with each other. <i>Well,</i> Izzy thought to herself <i>If they don’t know each other they probably won’t notice me, at least until it’s to far to kick me off.</i> She stood up and started looking for the boarding plank, then realized she could not remember seeing anybody get on by walking.     <br>  “Figures everybody else has flight” she grumbled. She picked up a small sack of clothes tied up in a bandana and flung it onto the boat, then put her hand up to her shoulder letting a ladybug that she had on her hand crawl to a safer place. After taking a few steps back she made a running jump for the edge of the boat. Izzy barely made it, she hung there clinging to the side of the boat for a moment, then heaved herself over. After a second of catching her breath, she returned the ladybug to the top of her right hand.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"I take it that you're intending to come along with us?" Miko asked, offering the girl a hand. "Well, if you want a ride, just say so. Where we're going is gonna be dangerous, but if any threat can handle us..." Miko paused for a moment. "Let's just put it this way. I haven't found anything yet that could."<br><br>"I'm not expecting an explanation or an introduction or anything. Judging by how you act, you don't want to give us one anyways. In our group, that's fully understood." Miko said warmly, giving a reassuring smile to the new girl. She nodded nervously.<br><br>"My name is Miko... And that's all that you'll hear of me right now." Miko said in a confidential tone. "The hairy one is Joseph, the other girl is Mia, the elf is Celestia, that guy looking slightly flustered over there is the captain, and the very sour looking one is Rick." Joseph rolled to his feet, and staggered over, still groggy from his nap.<br><br>"You sure about her, Miko?" Joseph asked, scanning her with his eyes behind his sunglasses.<br><br>"Hey, you and Helen came to us with about as much fanfare. I think..." Miko smiled subtly. "She'll be okay."<br><br>"With that said, I believe that it's time for us all to depart." Miko said, gesturing to the others in a regal manner.<br><br>OOC: Take us away, Bulbs.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Yoshimitsu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">OOC- Hope you don't mind me joining, Lee. It looks like you're down to yourself, Bulbs and Clicker, so I figured I was okay to jump in. Let me know if I'm wrong though!<br><br>BIC-<br><br>"Miko," a strong voice said, the voice of a warrior but with the compassion of a friend. It spoke with confidence, but not so much that it was arrogant, and with trust. Yoshimitsu, too, was stood on the docks. He had changed again, but not so much that he was unrecognisable.<br><br>His hair had been restored to it's vivid aqua colour, and continued to defy gravity. Covering his deep blue eyes eyes he wore plain black shades, and in his right ear lobe was a paperclip he had evidently put through a piercing. Through either side of his lower lip, there was a silver stud.<br><br>The boy had obviously developed a fondness for putting holes in his body.<br><br>On his upper body, he wore a plain white shot-sleeved top that hugged his torso, showing his lean, toned physique, the signs of an athletic teenager. On his lower body, he wore some plain navy jeans, apparently brand new and unused, that fell to his heavy black combat boots, which were scuffed and slightly dirty. Hanging as his waist was the Bahamut Blade, restored to it's original state, and strapped to the base of his spine were two handguns.<br><br>"Fratley told me about your mission, figured giving you a hand was the least I could do," Yoshimitsu said, fiddling with a pouch that was also hanging from his belt. He teetered there for a moment, before nodding to Miko and joining them on the boat.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Loogs</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"HA! Looks like I'm not the only one who looks like they got into a fight with a nail gun and lost!" Hector dashed up behind Yoshimitsu and slapped him on the back so hard he knocked the wind out of him. He himself had eight piercings going down each ear's side, one on his eyebrow, a nose stud, and a labret, and "one you really don't want to know the location of", in his words. Instead of long blue locks, he now had it cut fairly short, and bleached it a bright platinum blonde.<br><br>"Yoshi! How the hell are ya?! It's been way too long! I see you too can't part with that blade!" He unsheathed his own Tiamat Blade, the counterpart, and waved it around in the air, causing dazzling crimson flames to flit and twirl around in the air. "Maybe a warm reuinion duel would be in order!"</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Yoshimitsu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Nail gun? Nah, I just fell into a construction site," Yoshimitsu replied, grinning. He rubbed his back where Hector slapped him. "I see you discovered the delights of hair dye too," he added with a nod to Hector's hair. "It has been a while, hasn't it?"<br><br>Yoshimitsu was grinning broadly. He hadn't seen Hector in a while, it was true, though a part of him didn't miss the physical abuse he received when he was around the formerly-blue haired fire wielder. He nodded to the Tiamat blade.<br>"Old habits die hard, eh? And maybe later for that spar, I don't much fancy destroying the boat," he said, gesturing around him. "Gotta warn you though, I've picked up a few neat tricks since the last time I saw ya."</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">OOC: Yoshi, you get Steph's characters for this, I guess.<br>I'm imagining THIS:<br><a href="http://newimages.yachtworld.com/1/5/0/4/2/1504223_1.jpg?1141029783000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">newimages.yachtworld.com/1/5/0/4/2/1504223_1.jpg?1141029783000</a><br>As our boat, although considerably rougher around the edges. That canopy on top is just TOO sweet.<br><br>BIC: "Glad to have you along, Yoshimitsu." Miko said warmly, seizing him in a hearty handshake.<br><br>The captain nodded slightly, and then turned away from the group, walking to the front of the boat. He turned a key, and the boat's engines began to fire.<br><br>"Now, Miko... A few questions about the... Practicality of this trip." Joseph muttered slowly.<br><br>"Shoot. Not literally." Miko responded.<br><br>"We've got 'leven people on a fifty foot boat."<br><br>"Yah." Miko said, swaying slightly to catch his balance as the boat began moving out to sea.<br><br>"It might seem big and interesting now, but we'll get sick of it pretty fast. Heck, some of us might get sick of it right away." Joseph grumbled.<br><br>"You think?" Rick stated bitterly, drawing an irrate glare from Mia.<br><br>"Well, how long could we be in transit?" Miko asked loudly, clearly inviting the captain to give his input.<br><br>"This boat can go thirty knots, no problem, day in and day out. We'll need to stop once we run out of fuel, and give time to refuel." The captain shouted to the group behind him.<br><br>"Fueling, at sea?" Joseph snorted incredulously.<br><br>"Don't underestimate me. Diesel fuel is simply dead plants, and conjuring up enough to fuel this thing is only an evening's chore." Miko said confidently. "With my talents and a craft this fine, we can be there in two weeks. Barring any recreation stops on islands and such."<br><br>"How are we going to get through the ice? I mean, we could chop through it on our own, but wouldn't that be incredibly dangerous?" Vathale asked, holding Pleiades close to comfort her in the rocking of the boat.<br><br>"No need. I've arranged only for a ride to the southern tip of New Guinea. There, I've got access to some contacts that should be able to general-area teleport us to the outer networks of summoner tunnels in Antarctica. Naturally, I'd recommend-" Miko turned towards Vathale, his face suddenly grave. "That we don't take children or anybody unwilling along. It gets pretty harsh from there."<br><br>Joseph looked at his leader's face, recalling what Miko had said a while ago about his own childhood in the barren lands. <i> Miko... I trust you... But I really hope that this isn't more than you can chew that you're biting off here. </i><br><br>OOC: Fun note: NPCs outnumber normal characters here. Though we can shed some at the teleport spot, hopefully, paring our numbers down to managability.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Two weeks on a boat," Yoshimitsu said to himself, leaning on the railings and looking at the water. "Probably make it faster on my own, but I'd get lost, I'm sure."<br>"Ahh, don't be like that, Yosh," Hector said, clapping Yoshimitsu on the shoulder. "C'mon, it'll be fun."<br>"If you say so, Hec," Yoshimitsu replied. "Frat put me on this trip. I'm working for the Burmecians at the moment, so whatever assignments they put me on I have to go with."<br>"Rough deal," Hector said, shrugging. "What do you get out of it?"<br>"Money," Yoshimitsu said. "A couple of bits and pieces. This pouch, for example. You'll see what it's for if I have to use it." Yoshimitsu shrugged.<br>"You were never this secretive around me, Yosh," Hector commented.<br>"People change. It's what happens when you don't keep in touch for a couple of years," Yoshimitsu replied.<br>"Fair point."<br><br>Yoshimitsu gazed down at the water, thinking again. His thoughts were interrupted once more by Hector.<br>"So when'd you start liking guns?" He asked.<br>"Eh, Vincent got me on them. Useful, good for some situations," Yoshimitsu said. There was a definite chill to his voice now.<br>"Vincent? That kid who got to Tiamat before me?" Hector asked.<br>"The very same," Yoshimitsu answered. Hector was apparently the master of obliviousness, as Yoshimitsu's voice was practically freezing the air around him.<br>"Well... I'm gonna go make sure Vathale's alright," Hector said. Yoshimitsu gave a non-committal grunt, and Hector took his leave. Yoshimitsu returned his gaze to the sea, losing himself in thought once more.<br><br>OOC- Just a li'l catch-up talk. Next post will be less dialogue heavy x.o</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">  Iris paced awkwardly on the deck for a while. Every few moments she put one of her hands to the other, so her ladybug could keep crawling. Finally she decided to ask someone about their destination. She glanced around for someone to ask and saw the really hairy guy called Joseph. Iris decided she’d prefer to ask Miko, and started to search for him, which considering the size of the boat didn’t take to long. Cautiously she meandered over to him.<br>  “Umm, hello,” She said shyly. “I was just wandering where we, umm, were going?”<br><br><br>OOC: sorry lee I had no intention of posting this late but I was busy talking on the phone till midnight <br></div></div>

BTW, really liked the dialogue, El.<br><br>BIC: "You mean you joined a bunch of strangers, with no idea where we were even headed to?" Miko asked incredulously. He licked his lips, and bit the corner of his lower lip. "Either you're gutsy, an imbicile, or both. Like Hector."<br><br>"And damn proud of it, too!" Hector shouted from the canopied deck above.<br><br>"Exhibit A." Miko muttered. "Anyways, we're headed to the South Pole, although as you may have heard, we're going through a contact at New Guinea, saving us a lot of time. From there, I'm going to visit my people, and handle a few official matters as well as replacing my weapon that a certain somebody destroyed."<br><br>"You know, I can hear everything you say." Hector responded, his blonde mop peering over the edge of the sheltering roof above them. He smiled slightly. "Eh, I deserve a tongue lashing anyways. Carry on."<br><br>"So, anyways, I'm allowing you to come along. Anybody who's willing to be our friend is our friend, simple as that. And if you're willing, I'm sure that us summoners can teach you a couple tricks that'll come in handy." Miko said with a warm smile.<br><br>OOC: Mack, check PMs.</div></div>

"Sounds like Hector." He straightened up and raised his voice, slightly, addressing the new person. "In case you're interested, it isn't just the summoners that can teach you some tricks. If you like, I can teach you some of the stuff I can do."<br><br>"By the way, Miko," Yoshimitsu added, his voice lowered slightly so only Miko could hear him. "I've got a... well, request. If at all possible, if we're force to split up, please don't pair me up with Hector." Yoshimitsu glanced around, making sure no one was listening. "I've got a couple of issues with him at the moment, even if he doesn't know it."<br><br>OOC- Bleh short, but I wanted to reply.

Miko replied, leaning on the railing. He twisted his fingertips twice, a ball of green light forming in his palm. He gestured again, and the light congealed into a pear.<br><br>"It always seems like something with you two. Either you're the closest of friends, or the worst of enemies. But the problem is that this time, Hector is one, and you're the other," Miko muttered, and took a large chunk out of the fruit. He then stood up, stretched, and looked around. "Anybody want something to eat?"<br>--------<br>"Hey, sourpuss." Joseph grumbled to Rick.<br><br>"I thought that nobody said that word any more." Rick replied, watching the clouds on the horizon.<br><br>"Some people live more in the past than the present." Joseph grumbled, rifling through his pockets.<br><br>"Are you going to try giving me a pep-talk to 'convert me' to the cause?" Rick asked with a hint of venom in his voice.<br><br>"Of course not. I'm no busybody."<br><br>"So, why are you talking with me again?"<br><br>"Miko and I have talked through anything two men would want to talk about, the rest of the ship is occupied by a bunch of kids, and the captain's hording all of the good liquor for himself. So that leaves you and me, bud."<br><br>"Seems reasonable enough."<br><br>"Huh. Expecting reason from this group. Good luck."<br><br>"Even if I don't like people, I don't judge them without knowing them. I learned that well growing up."<br><br>"Oh, you see, I thought that at first. But after I screwed myself over badly enough to ruin my life, I decided that first impulses were right ninety percent of the time. Miko? Good guy, too dedicated to a cause for his own good. Hector? Not really all that brilliant, but he wants to do good things. Yoshimitsu? Too shifty for us to count on, in my opinion. You? You're smug enough, I'd say, but you're not a hopeless cause."<br><br>"How often do your find yourself wrong? When you mess up, it's throwing away trust of perfectly fine people."<br><br>"I'm right more often then I'm wrong."<br><br>OOC: BTW, if anybody has any idea for island pitstops, PM me.

And with that, Yoshimitsu went to the front of the boat, leaning on the railing again and thinking.<br><br><i>"He's not stupid, he knows something's up,"</i> Yoshimitsu thought, as he looked at the waves. <i>"Hector... It almost makes me feel nostalgic. When I think about what we used to do together, all those adventures we had..."</i> It gave him a twinge of regret. But they had both gone their seperate ways - Hector's had lead to the start of a family, while his had lead to Vincent. And now, with Vincent as he was, he had been left with little more than his job. A Burmecian Agent. It was convenient, he guessed, working under Fratley. He could trust his superior, and he could get as much money as he needed, but for some reason Fratley wouldn't let him do the more dangerous missions.<br><br>"I dunno," Yoshimitsu muttered to himself.<br>"What don't ya know?" Hector asked, reappearing at Yoshimitsu's side again.<br>"Working for Fratley," Yoshimitsu said. "Just having a couple of doubts."<br>"Oh? 'Cause you're working for rat person?" Hector said jokingly.<br>"Ha ha," Yoshimitsu replied sarcastically. "I'm just thinking, all of the missions he puts me on are like this - long, almost guaranteed to be dull and not very physically challenging."<br>"You haven't changed much," Hector commented. "Still looking for a fight, eh?"<br>"That's one way to put it," Yoshimitsu said, shrugging. "I'm like the opposite of a sword - I need to fight to keep my edge."<br>"Well how about that sparring match, then?" Hector suggested.<br>"As far as I remember, you can't fly and I'm not risking ruining the boat," Yoshimitsu said, somewhat harsher than was necessary.<br><br>"What about when we make port?" Hector suggested.<br>"We'll see," Yoshimitsu said, reaching to the pouch at his waist.<br>"Gonna show me what that does yet?" Hector asked.<br>"It's not that fantastic," Yoshimitsu replied. Even though the pouch was blatantly too small to hold it, Yoshimitsu pulled out a bottle of coke. "It's just a lot bigger on the inside than it is the outside."<br>"That's pretty cool," Hector said. "What else ya got hidden in it?"<br>"Now that," Yoshimitsu said, "is a secret. If I have to use some of the stuff in there, it's for an emergency only."<br>"Huh... How did we get this distant, Yosh?" Hector asked.<br>"We followed different paths. Yours lead to Vathale and a family," Yoshimitsu said.<br><br>"And yours? Where did yours go?"<br><br>Yoshimitsu didn't reply at first. He was thinking about his reply - somehow, even though at this point he still wasn't the most fond of Hector, he felt that their old friendship had revived. It was back, and they were happy again, joking and adventuring, just being the people they used to be. He almost felt like he could trust Hector with his secrets and his stories again. Almost.<br><br>"Mine lead to darkness," Yoshimitsu said. <br>"What's that mean?" Hector asked, completely bemused.<br>"You'll probably find out, sooner or later."<br><br>OOC- Hooray, drama.</div></div>

I understand if you've lost a bit of trust in me. After all, I was at a downward spiral the last time you saw me." Hector, hands casually nestled in his pockets, glanced down at his belt, fondly eyeing the hilt of his Tiamat Blade. Its luster caught the sun's rays and split it neatly into several beams. He slowly unsheathed it and held it out in front of him. His trusty blade, which was always by his side through any messy situation, didn't lose an iota of shimmer over the years.<br><br>"You're right, my path did end up leading to a family. It's not the smartest decision I've made, but they make me happier than I've been in a while. But if there's anything that being a husband and father has taught me, it's that you need to be besides people, especially at their darkest hour." He put the blade back and warmly put an arm around Yoshi. "My paternal intuition's acting up, Yosh. I know when something's up. If there's anything, <i>anything</i> at all that's troubling you, just know that I'll be ready and willing to help you, so don't be afraid to ask." Hector put his hands back in his pockets and looked back at the cabin. "Now, I believe I brought a box of vodka with me on this ship. Pretty good stuff too. If Joseph didn't guzzle it all down already, I'll invite ya to drink with me."</div></div>

However, for Rick this situation was delicate. One of the great powers in this world, the Mages, had been in isolation for years and Rick was doing everything he could to change that. Had they choosen to make contact with the Valons people, or the Elementals, even the Humans would have been fine by Rick. <br><br>But they choose to start there grand return by contacting their oldest allies, the Summoners. The Mage knew nothing about the evil man that currently lead the South Pole Summoners. Nothing of the atrocities he had committed. The only thing that stopped Rick from taking on Miko now was razor edge that Rick had to walk being an Ambassador. Mia was ecstatic, to her Miko was royalty. <br><br>Rick looked back over at Joseph, “Why do you refer to Miko as a good guy?”<br><br>OOC- Poor post quality but I am tired and working on hastily getting stuff done. </div></div>

And I know how people can make mistakes, fail to do things that they should have..." Joseph turned and looked into Rick's eyes. There was something incredibly familiar there. Not just the emotions, regret and woe, but the nature of them. They were something he had seen before, somewhere... He knew that if he saw where he had seen them before, he would recognize them instantly.<br><br>"I've failed to do things that needed to be done, and did a lot of things I never should have done. We all have. So why give him ****? Not worth the trouble." Joseph turned away, watching the ocean swell and dip.<br><br>"In simple terms, his "boring rating" exceeds his "**** rating", and he's protecting the only thing I care about any more, anyways." He stood up, stretched, and started to walk away, obviously ignoring any other questions Rick had to ask.<br><br>"Wonderful." Miko paused, and then thought for a moment. "If you can learn from me, you'll be able to help me refuel this ship. And that would save us lots of time. Next island with greenery, we stop for about half an hour, and I'll teach you some basic tricks." Miko stopped for a moment, and held out his right hand, golden bracer glistening in the sun light. He bit his lip, and then held up his free hand in a gesture for his companion to wait a moment. He walked over to the side of the boat, and held his hand over the sloshing brine.<br><br>"Mangroves on an atoll, about a mile away." Miko turned again, repeated his earlier hand sign, and then pointed to the starboard side of the ship. Indeed, anybody who looked would see a black dot, slowly but steadily growing as they churned along. The summoner headed into the cabin, evidently to have a word with the captain of the ship.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Rick allowed Joseph to walk away. His eyes continued to scan out over the water as though he were searching for something familiar. The words he had just heard continued to echo in his mind. Was Joseph unaware of the destruction at Slateport? Reconstruction was still ongoing with no projected finish date. Everyday more bodies were unearthed from the rubble. People who had no warning when Miko turned his summon on the unsuspecting city. <br><br>The railing snapped as Rick hit it with his fist. Black flames wrapped around his hand as his fist clenched again. Then a familiar hand touched his back. He turned to see Mia, a sad look etched across her face. His hand returned to normal as the fire faded, though his fist remained clenched.<br><br>“Why do you hate him so?” Mia asked, her eyes briefly lingered on the broken railing before locking on Rick.<br><br>“He is responsible for the destruction of an entire city. There was no misunderstanding, it wasn’t an accident. We opposed him and in the process he allowed his beast to rampage through Slateport. Other occasions as well, he has been an enemy of my friends and I for a long time.”<br><br>Mia bit her lip and looked back at the door Miko had entered. “I’m sorry Rick, but our people need allies more than anything right now. Before we went into seclusion, our greatest allies were the Summoners.”<br><br>“That was four-hundred years ago. Miko wasn’t the leader of his people then.

"First place to make port... I hope to god Hector doesn't ask for the fight now. Just in case..."<br><br>Yoshimitsu raised his palm to his face, and looked as though he was focusing very hard on the lines on his hand. While he was focusing very hard on something, it definitely wasn't the palm of his hand. He closed his eyes, and slowly one side of his face was covered in a silver glow as something formed there. He only held it for a few seconds before he moved his hand away and the glow vanished.<br><br>"That's fine. At least my fallback's always up and running. Now, let's see..."<br><br>He drew the Bahamut Blade and raised his arm to the side. Calling Bahamut was no issue for him really, but he needed to be able to channel the dragon without summoning him. The was a flash, and suddenly the blade was covered in translucent blue flames, and seemed to hover on its own. The flames extended to Yoshimitsu's hand, and part way up his arm. He moved his arm, and the sword followed, as though it was still in his hand. Yoshimitsu shrugged, and the flames vanished.<br><br>"I think I'll be more than ready in that case," he said to himself.</div></div>

And by that, I mean getting bashed in the head with my keyboard by a gay guy, so I think I'll post now. <img src="//images.proboards.com/f/smiley/wink.png" alt=";)" class="smile"><br>BIC: Miko stood on the deck, looking rather focused as he began weaving a spell. His fingers were moving so quickly that it was hard for the eye to follow, a green luminiscience, similar to that of fireflies, building in the air before him. With a circular gesture with his left hand, the glow stopped growing, and snapped inwards. He extended his right hand, grabbing the shape in the center of the glow and walking towards the edge.<br><br>He tightened his fist, whatever was in his palm crunching loudly. A moment later, he sprinkled a jade colored dust into the water. A green line extended from it to the atoll, now clearly visible and close by. Miko looked around trying to figure out who was coming with him, and then decided that he'd just have whomever wanted to come along join him.<br><br>"Hey, Isabelle! Time to go!" Miko called, catching her attention and gesturing for her to come over to him. The girl, having been watching the ocean from the port side of the ship, turned to face him and jogged over.<br><br>"So, where's our boat?" She asked, glancing around questioningly.<br><br>"No boats. No life rafts, no life boats, no landing crafts... Nothing of the sort on here." Miko mused, partially informing her, and partially thinking of it himself. "We walk."<br><br>"On water? Who do you think you are?" Isabelle did a double take, looking at Miko's face first, to see if he was serious, and then again to make sure she wasn't going crazy.<br><br>"I may be the emperor, but I don't put on airs to such a degree." Miko said with a chuckle, and gestured with his thumb over the edge. There, something appearing to be a green carpet the width of a small road stretched across the surface of the ocean, gently rising and falling with the waves. "I gathered as much phytoplankton as I could in a narrow band, meaning that it should be able to support our bodies. It won't last too long, but it should hold out for at least ten minutes." Miko's mouth tweaked slightly, evidently a subdued smile of pride in his intelligence. He then hopped over the edge, landing with a loud squish on the walkway crafted of microscopic plants. He then began walking along it, unsteadily at first, but soon gaining his balance and moving at much faster pace.<br><br>He turned around, and waved his hand, calling Isabelle to follow him to the small ring of trees incongruously in the middle of the open ocean.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Celestia perked up from her resting spot, and grabbed her bow and quiver.  "What," She said noticing the long strip of phyto plankton, "They must be heading ashore! Excellent!" The elfen woman jumped in the air, her energy wings billowing in the sunshine, giving off an angelic look.  <br><br>"Miko," She yelled in a loud and effeminate voice, "I'm coming with you, though I won't have to use your green plant bridge, but I will fly slowly to make sure everyone makes it safely, I don't know if anyone can swim?" Celestia laughed and flew high ahead waiting for anyone else to join the party. <br></div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Yoshimitsu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"A walkway made entirely of plankton. I'm impressed, Miko," Yoshimitsu said, nodding appreciatively. The fact that Miko probably could not hear him did not deter him, because he'd never let anyone intentionally know that he was impressed by them. Unfortunately for him, he was heard.<br>"Yoshi, admitting to be impressed. That's a first," Hector said, appearing at Yoshimitsu's side, a smirk on his face. Yoshimitsu shrugged.<br>"I'm trying out new things, y'know?" Yoshimitsu replied. "How are you crossing the water anyway?"<br>"Miko made a bridge?" Hector smirked again, and pointed at the phytoplankton bridge.<br>"Oh? Not gonna make your own way?" Yoshimitsu asked, raising his eyebrows.<br>"You mean you are?"<br>"Naturally. Step back, please."<br><br>Yoshimitsu hopped up to the railing of the boat and stood there, holding his palms together and closing his eyes. A bit of elemental control, it was nothing major. A mile or so long bridge that could support itself somehow and not get swept a way in the tide, however, was not minor. He focused very intently on his element of choice, feeling it fill his hands, causing them to glow. Suddenly, he shot from the boat, and thrust his palms at the water, firing a white beam from them. As soon as the beam touched the water, the water froze over, creating a decent sized platform of ice that extended to his destination.<br><br>Yoshimitsu landed on the ice, slightly breathless. He paused only to freeze some small ice blades to his shoes, allowing his to skate at his leisure to the island. As soon as he reached the atoll, he would melt the bridge so the water's climate didn't change.<br><br>"Always a show off," Hector muttered, grinning, as he hopped on to the ice bridge and followed Yoshimitsu.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Thanks for the cover, Celest'," Miko responded warmly, his subdued grin now growing into a friendly smile. He extended his left hand, a vine rising out of the ocean like a surfacing serpent, and then wrapping itself around the railing tightly.<br><br>"There you go, Isabelle," He turned, and continued walking. If the girl was bold enough to jump onto a random ship, then she'd be brave enough to slide down the vine onto a supernatural catwalk. He glanced to the side, and saw Yoshimitsu fly by on his skates.<br><br>"Clever... I shoulda just waited on that, and then grew plants over it to make it easier to walk on..." Miko made a mental note of his companion's capacity for such powers. It seemed that since their last meeting, he had grown much more powerful, or at least significantly more practiced in the use of what powers he did have. It was hard to say from a display like the most recent one.<br><br>Miko braced himself as a wave rolled under the walkway. It was unlikely that it would have even made him stumble, but he couldn't be too safe. Besides, if he did anything that looked too stupid, Joseph and Hector wouldn't shut up about it for the rest of the trip. That was a threat greater than any other he could foresee... Setting his jaw grimly, he continued striding towards the destination.<br><br>"You any good at tieing knots?" He shouted back to Isabelle, only turning his head for a moment to make sure she was behind him.<br><br>"If you aren't, this could be really tricky." Miko mumbled to himself, curling his fingers. The carpet of plankton curled inwards, preventing the spray from the waves from reaching him. Concentrating more intensely, he unfurled his fists, and brought his hands up. Large, leafy sheets of green shot up from the edges of the bridge for the last few steps of the way to the atoll, shielding it. Miko licked his lips, and then stepped up onto the wet stone and gnarled roots of the island. A crab scuttled out of his way, descending into the maze of mangroves that entwined the land. The Summoner began speaking the moment Isabelle left the walkway.<br><br>"First things first, clear your mind, and hold your hands like this," Miko instructed, not wasting any time on the formalities, and turned his arms inwards at the elbows, left palm facing up with the right palm resting on top of it. They were on a schedule, and he was in charge of meeting said agenda. If it meant teaching this girl only a few tricks at a time, so be it. It was better than nothig.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Yoshimitsu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Yoshimitsu game sliding to a halt as he neared the end of the ice bridge, the blades on his shoes making a terrible screeching noise as he turned completely side on to stop himself. He promptly hopped from the bridge, and waited for Hector to finish making his way so he could get rid of it.<br><br>"Bit slow, aren't you, Hector?" Yoshimitsu taunted as Hector finally arrived at the island. He pointed his palm at the ice bridge and frowned, concentrating hard. With alarming speed, the ice melted into water, the temperature rapidly rising so that it was the same as the surrounding ocean.<br><br>"Not all of us can make skates so easily," Hector replied, punching Yoshimitsu playfully on the soldier.<br><br>"Yeah, clearly 'cause you fail," Yoshimitsu said, looking at the island. It seemed nice enough, plenty of plantlife, and the landing was nice enough. Good size.<br><br>"Not as much as you," Hector retorted.<br><br>"Oh yeah? Wanna put your money where your mouth is?" Yoshimitsu challenged, grinning.<br><br>"Is that a threat? Or a promise?" Hector asked, grinning. Yoshimitsu replied, by reaching to the Bahamut blade, while groping around in the pouch at his waist. After a few seconds, he pulled out a second sword, a katana with no guard.<br><br>"Show me whatcha got, Hector," Yoshimitsu said, jumping back so there was a decent space between the teenagers. Hector grinned, and grabbed one of his swords. It was gold in colour, almost alarmingly long, and it looked a lot heavier than either of Yoshimitsu's swords.<br><br>"First cut wins," Yoshimitsu declared. "I don't want to hurt you as much as I could."<br><br>"Oh yeah? I can't wait to see you try," Hector replied. Yoshimitsu took that as the challenge, and took the first move.<br><br>Yoshimitsu was showing just how much he'd improved immediately. He was <i>fast</i>. As he darted around Hector, he was blurred, moving too quickly for him to be seen properly. He threw himself into a violent vertical spin, bringing the Bahamut blade sweeping down at Hector, who immediately raised his own sword to defend, placing his palm on the blade for some extra support. Quickly, the blonde teenager angled his sword so that Yoshimitsu slid off the blade and lost his balance. However, even as Hector swung his sword down, Yoshimitsu flipped to his hands, and threw himself into the air, the blade narrowly missing cutting off his hand.<br><br>"You're getting better, Hec," Yoshimitsu said, spinning in the air and bringing the second sword, the katana swinging down at his opponent.<br><br>"You're not so bad yourself," Hector replied, again raising his sword to block. Metal clashed with metal, but Yoshimitsu quickly twisted and kicked off the golden sword, flipping to land on his feet a decent distance away. Hector ran at Yoshimitsu, gripping the sword in both hands now for better control, and spun into a horizontal slash, but Yoshimitsu ducked under the attack. Hector quickly shifted his grip, moving with a speed Yoshimitsu thought almost impossible considering the size of the weapon, bringing is down diagonally. Yoshimitsu jumped back to dodge this one, but Hector didn't let up, and stabbed at Yoshimitsu's stomach. Yoshimitsu sidestepped this, but Hector again attacked, bringing the blade round from the side.<br><br>There was a flash of light, and suddenly the blade stopped without meeting Yoshimitsu's arm. Something had formed there. Now, Yoshimitsu's arm was covered by a perculiar sort of armour. Extending from his wrist to his shoulder was what looked like samurai armour plates, each seperate plate adorned with spikes like those running down Bahamut's back. Covering his hand was Bahamut's head, but a still version, more like a model. clamped in Bahamut's mouth was the Bahamut blade, but even though it was in the dragon's mouth, Yoshimitsu could still spin and twirl it, as though it was phasing through the dragon head.<br><br>"Neat trick. That's Bahamut, isn't it?" Hector asked, jumping back.<br><br>"Yeah, I've been experimenting with summoning him into things," Yoshimitsu said conversationally. "I think it's worked pretty well, don't you?"<br><br>"Yeah, it looks cool, but I still don't think you can beat me," Hector said, smirking.<br><br>"Let's find out," Yoshimitsu said, raising the Bahamut blade. He slashed at the air in front of him. As he did so, he released a blade of blue and gold flames, much like Bahamut's Mega Flare attack. Hector grinned, a confident look on his face, and brought his sword cutting through the attack. However, that clearly wasn't Yoshimitsu's intention. No sooner than Hector had dissipated the flames, Yoshimitsu was in the air again, bringing the new style of weapon swinging down again. Hector didn't block this time, he swung his sword in an arc above his head, making Yoshimitsu quickly draw up his katana to defend. The blue haired teenager quickly used the momentum caused by the swords meeting to spin in the air and swing his foot down, crashing into the back of Hector's head, sending him staggering. Yoshimitsu seized his opportunity and slashed again, opening a very shallow cut on Hector's bicep.<br><br>"Looks like I win," Yoshimitsu said, grinning as the armour faded from his arm.<br><br>"That was a cheap hit," Hector retorted.<br><br>"But it worked, didn't it? Hang on, I'll heal that for you," Yoshimitsu said. He raised his first finger and traced Hector's cut, green sparks playing over the skin and knitting it back together. <br><br>"Next time we hit an island, we'll spar again and raise the stakes a bit," Hector declared.<br><br>"Yeah, and we'll see if you can beat me just once on this trip," Yoshimitsu smirked.</div></div>

He was already sliding his swords back into their respective sheathes as he walked, with Hector only a few steps behind him. He kept one hand on the hilt of the Bahamut Blade, just in case. "Why would you want to fight here? Better, why would you want to fight at all?"<br><br>"Uh, Yoshi? What we did we just do?" Hector chipped in. Yoshimitsu wanted to turn and and smack him.<br><br>"We were <i>sparring</i>, not fighting," Yoshimitsu said, glancing at the now grinning Hector. "But thats totally not the point.

So this greedy bastard could become more powerful.”<br><br>Ricks hand grasped the bladeless hilt strapped to his belt, “Tell me Miko, was the cost worth it?”<br></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"From a military standpoint? No," Miko began walking towards Rick, waving his hand downwards and the waves parting. Stepping on the now dry rock, he met Rick with his carnelian gaze.<br><br>"From a diplomatic standpoint? Not at all. From a personal standpoint? I consider it a total failure. My people's morale was bolstered considerably by the ease that the city was destroyed with, but I... I found it disheartening. My people always said that taking land for ourselves was glorious, what we were meant to do. We were starting at the base of the globe, and climbing to the greatest heights-"<br><br>"That was all a load of bull. The common man wasn't our enemy. We were his. And when we began to rise against him, he was forced into conflict with us."<br><br>"So if you're wondering if I'm proud of what I did, I'm not. I'm the reason why my people are hated and reviled around the planet. We're seen as being as evil as Nazis, as insidious as terrorists. In a London club, the week after the Slateport incident, a man was beaten to death for having green hair. The assailants walked after claiming self defense."<br><br>"The only reason why nobody has tried to destroy the Summoner society at the South Pole is because they're afraid that our agents would obliterate every major city on earth in retaliation. They don't realize that I'm the only one of us with anywhere near that calibre of power."<br><br>"So, if you're wondering if I'm thinking murdering millions of people in order to villify my race was a good decision, the answer would be no," Miko twirled his cape, and turned away from Rick.</div></div>

Had anyone of those been yes would you have taken pride in hurting innocent people? Your only concern is that your people have been ‘vilified’. Do you not feel remorse for those you killed?”<br><br>Rick’s right hand tightened on the hilt as he took a deep breath, “Miko, you just don’t get it do you?” Light burst from the end of the empty hilt as he pulled it from his belt. Tendrils grew and coiled as the blade lengthened forming a rather sturdy broadsword. His left hand had become enveloped in black mist that seemed to stretch out and retract independently.<br><br>“Do you think maybe fate brought us together today? That maybe in the grand scheme I am the one meant to slay Miko, the monster of the south?” Rick laughed, “The only drawback is that Lee would never forgive me for being the one to strike you down when I know he feels it’s his right.”<br></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"And that's where you fail to get it," Miko didn't attempt to produce a weapon, merely slipping a ring off of his right index finger.<br><br>"Whatever my sins are in the past, I'm willing to be an asset to the whole planet now. I had power then, and used it the wrong way. It had a bad effect. I have power now, and am trying to use it for a good result," Miko crushed the ring, a green glow forming around his right hand.<br><br>"Of course, if you'd rather, you could kill me and let Bagan be passed on to a much more militant summoner than myself. One who would repeat my mistakes, smash another city, maybe two or three before they learned their lesson."<br><br>"Valon and Zebedee both have come to terms with the situation. They're the most level headed, diplomatic in your little group there. Don't you think that it would be best to listen to their ideas instead of your own?" Miko lowered his hand again.<br><br>"Of course, that's not what this is about at all. This isn't a debate about my present state, or what I deserve for the Slateport incident. You know as well as I do that this whole conflict between you and me is because of the Kul'Tathen. Considering that siding with them, instead of letting them attack Olivine, where my family lives, ended up making me ally to Valcara and Koji..." Miko looked down, the water beginning to run around his feet again.<br><br>"Your revenge is a sentiment that is fully expected, if somewhat overdue. I'll accept your attempt at such, since you're fully entitled."</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Yoshimitsu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"That's enough!" Yoshimitsu said loudly, strongly. His hand had flown to his sword, which was now half-drawn, just in case. "For god's sake, this isn't meant to be about revenge or punishment. This isn't a trip where people are trying to settle scores or make enemies. We're here because we want to be here, to help Miko or whatever." Yoshimitsu's grip on the Bahamut blade tightened slightly. He had never met Rick before, but the hatred that was barely concealed in every word he said was not something he could ignore.<br><br>"Dammit, can't you see that Miko's trying to make things better? He's trying to make up for what he's done? I know that doesn't make up for it, but at least he's trying to make amends." Yoshimitsu's voice had risen now. "Which is more than I can say for you. I wont stand here and let you attack Miko."</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Yoshimitsu, Hector, stand down. I know that both of you understand, but he doesn't," Miko muttered, raising his glowing hand and pointing it directly at Rick.<br><br>"He's had this anger brewing inside of him for ages. Not just at me, but at the people I've associated with. Cobra killed Ender, Koji killed Sly, and Valcara murdered his mother. Such things can embitter somebody for life," The summoner stomped with his left boot, the water drawing back again until the top of the atoll was completely exposed. Small creatures scuttled and climbed for cover as the earth rapidly dried beneath them.<br><br>"I'm that one point where all of the misery you've gone through up to this point intersects, aren't I? Well, then come. Let it all out. If we don't do this now, you'll just come after me at some other time," Miko began moving his free hand about, strands of light appearing from the air as he touched it. If Rick attacked now, he'd be ready to counter it, hopefully, but... One could never be sure.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Yoshimitsu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Yoshimitsu's eyes moved from Miko to Rick slowly. <br>"Hector, let's go," Yoshimitsu said, turning away, sliding his sword back into its sheath. He looked back over his shoulder. "Miko, not that I doubt ya, but if things get too rough for ya, just yell." He grabbed Hector's shoulder and spun the blonde teen round, walking a fair distance away from Miko and Rick. However, he didn't return to the boat, and turned around again, watching them.<br><br>"Yoshi, why you getting so worked up over this?" Hector asked.<br>"Because," Yoshimitsu said, choosing his words carefully. "I know what it's like to live in the past. There's no point holding old grudges, life's too short and all that. If he-" Yoshimitsu nodded at Rick "-doesn't stop, he'll either get ripped apart by Miko, or he'll end up torturing himself, looking for revenge. Neither of those are worth anything." Hector considered this for a moment.<br>"You've given that a lot of thought," he said.<br>"I don't want anyone to live a life like mine. I've made too many mistakes," Yoshimitsu said, his voice once again reaching freezing point.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">“Rick don’t-” Mia started but was cut off by Rick.<br><br>“Mia, we both know what will happen to you if you stay here. White and black magic don’t mix.” Despite all the hatred that flowed through him his words towards her now were soft. <br><br>“But what about Shin-Ra?” Mia questioned, “You’re the last black mage and if you do this all the trust you’ve worked so hard to earn from the other mages will be lost…”<br><br>“Execution or exile,” Rick said, then turned to look back at her, “Mia, please go.”<br><br>She bit her lip and hesitated, “If you get hurt I can’t heal you…” <br><br>Rick didn’t respond. Mia sat down on her trunk as it floated by her. Slowly it made its way toward Yoshimitsu and Hector. When she was safely out of range, Rick turned back to Miko.<br><br>“Just shut up Miko.”<br><br>Rick dropped to his knees and thrust his mist-covered hand into the dirt burying it nearly up to his elbow. Immediately the ground around Miko erupted in every direction as tendrils of crystallized black energy ripped their way towards the summoner. <br></div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"You chose poorly for our initial matchup," Miko jerked his hand, and the glow shot into the earth like a green bullet. A moment later, the rock about him was obliterated further as massive vines, each covered in thorns and the size of a telephone pole, surged outwards. They intertwined with the tendrils, exerting incredible ammounts of pressure. As the black tentacles continued surging forwards, Miko balled his hand into a fist.<br><br>As the first one came within inches of his face, it shattered. Quickly following its lead, the others all exploded in showers of smokey grey. Miko crossed his arms, watching Rick haughtily and smirking while the shards rained around him.<br><br>"I was expecting much worse from you, Rick. Aren't Black Mages supposed to be the greatest engines of destruction that magic has to offer?" Miko maintained his expression, though at heart, he was much less confident. <i>I've gotta make him think I've got him utterly outclassed. If I don't, my plan won't work nearly as well...</i></div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Hamuu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">“I told you to shut up!” Rick snarled wolfishly. <br><br>An emotional maelstrom raged within the mages soul. Anger, pain, fear, and hate – all that had been pent up was now unleashed and strengthening his magic. Even those around him were feeding him with their negative feelings. Giving him the power he would need to defeat Miko. <br><br>But Rick couldn’t go full power to quickly, this release of emotion had already caused the other soul within him to stir. If it woke up completely then the entirety of Ricks being would focus on containing it. That would leave him open to any of Miko’s attacks. In addition, if he became to drunk with the constant flow of power from the individuals gathered here then his lust for power would take over and he would willingly release the demon within. Years of mastering his power had taught him to control both the demon and the lust, but with out the Elder Seers to guide him in his training Rick was never able to fully blend with them. Something that Rick knew would eventually cost him dearly.<br><br>For now, he would have to gradually build up to his more powerful spells. He withdrew his hand from the dirt and punched down again. This time, instead of his hand making another hole, it disappeared into his shadow. It reappeared at Miko’s feet and clutched the Summoners ankle. With a jerk Rick pulled him through the shadow and, continuing the motion, threw Miko as hard as he could towards the center of the island. Rick kicked off the ground and flew after him reading his sword to strike wherever he landed. <br><br>OOC- Hope you don’t mind the auto. I just reallllly wanted to do that <img src="//images.proboards.com/f/smiley/tongue.png" alt=":P" class="smile"><br><br>And sorry about the long winded middle part, but I had to do that since not everyone is clear about Ricks history. And will play a part in this fight. <br></div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Urgh," Miko didn't even have time to say anything before Rick had flung him. He had clearly underestimated the versatility of the youth when it came to magic. Miko somersaulted through the air, catching himself on his feet before he could collide with the harsh stone. Rick's blade met air, Miko having ducked the attack reflexively.<br><br>"Do you think that you can match me? Honestly?" Miko brought up his bracer, and sparks flew as he parried Rick's next swing. Twirling his cape to his right, Miko spun around behind Rick, launching a kick at the back of his head. The mage was too canny, however, and ducked the blow as he spun to strike at Miko. The blade stopped again, now striking an invisible screen of force that Miko had conjured at the last moment.<br><br>"Try this," Miko growled, and threw a punch directly at Rick's face.<br><br>OOC: I'm seeing it as both characters are "Gishes" so to speak, with Rick a far better caster and Miko a better trained melee fighter with experience on his side.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Hamuu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Rick’s body tumbled backward through the air as it skipped along the ground. Reaching out with his hands, he dug them into the earth creating a large scar in the ground as he slowed himself down. A small trickle of blood emanated from his brow but Rick immediately placed his finger against the small wound. <br><br>“Fire,” He muttered and gritted his teeth as flame leapt across his finger and cauterized the wound. The mage stood up and readied himself for another assault on Miko.<br><br><i>Release me…</i><br><br>Rick stood completely still. Up until he had been shadowcasting, the fire he had just conjured was the first instance of real black magic in this fight. Had such a basic spell really been enough to awaken <i>him</i>? Had Rick grown that weak? Or… had he grown that much stronger?<br><br><i>Do not confine me… Do not use my power as your own…</i><br><br>“**** off,” Rick said to himself and then leapt up off the ground. His body flew high into the air until the atoll had become a small dot beneath him. With a deep breath, he closed his eyes and leaned backward allowing himself to enter a freefall. He gained speed unnatural fast as he used his own ability to fly to push himself down towards the small island. As he neared impact his sword ignited in black flames. <br><br>Rick readied his sword in the event he actually made impact with Miko, though it was unlikely. Miko or ground, the mage didn’t care which one he struck. <br></div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Yoshimitsu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Nice trick," Yoshimitsu commented, following the fight easily. "I'll have to ask him how he does that."<br>"How which one does what?" Hector asked, frowning.<br>"The one that's not Miko. I don't know his name," Yoshimitsu replied. "That thing he did where he grabbed Miko. It was pretty neat."<br>"Oh, right," Hector said simply. "How come you're so interested in this fight anyway?"<br>"Because it involves Miko, and because I know what's driving the other guy," Yoshimitsu said.<br>"Why Miko and what drive?" Hector asked, rubbing the back of his head now.<br><br>"Why Miko? Hec, he's one of the most powerful individuals in the world. Hell, <i>I</i> wouldn't want to fight him, and I've been improving so much recently," Yoshimitsu explained. "That man has more tricks up his sleeve than any street magician. If I ever have to fight him, though I probably wouldn't, I'd probably be a bit intimidated. Would you want to fight someone as strong as him?"<br><br>"Okay, fair enough. What about the other guy? What's so interesting about him?"<br><br>"His drive. He's fuelled by anger and hate. If he holds back in the end, I'll be surprised. And can't you sense the power coming from him? It's intense," Yoshimitsu said, frowning as Rick cast the fire spell. "And there's something else about him, there's definitely more to him than meets the eye. I've yet to meet a mage who doesn't have some amazing fighting ability, and I'll be damned before that's him."<br><br>"That's why you're still here?"<br><br>"No, there's one other reason. If Miko looks like he's losing, I might have to step in," Yoshimitsu said, frowning.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">“No, if Rick looks as though he’s going to kill Miko then I will stop him.” Mia said.<br><br>She held out her hand and revealed a small ball of light dancing just above her palm. “It’s called a flash heal and one of the few healing spells that can be used over long distances. It’s low level and would usually just help to give someone their second wind and heal up a few minor injuries. But healing spells are different when it comes to black mages. This would effectively become a tranquilizer. Anything stronger would send Rick into cardiac arrest or kill him out right.” <br><br>She closed her hand and rested it on the trunk. The possibility that she would have to do that to Rick scared her and she wasn’t entirely sure if the flash heal was weak enough to keep from killing him. Unfortunately it was the weakest long range spell she knew and her weakest spells required contact. But getting close to him when he was like this… the black magic radiating from his aura alone would be enough to kill her.<br></div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Yoshimitsu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Miko wont hurt him if he gets knocked out or hurt by your magic," Yoshimitsu said. "He wouldn't kill him either, if he knew he was winning." Yoshimitsu's hand was resting on the hilt of the Bahamut Blade again, as thought he was about to launch himself into the fray. "But if Rick looks like he's winning, I'm gonna step in. Miko's my ally and my friend, and if I'm sure I'm more than a match for Rick if it comes to it."<br><br>OOC- LOL SHORT POST</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Miko took advantage of the lull. His calloused hands instantly flew up and began to work feverishly, a spider crafting its web. Threads of green sprouted from the air, winding about his fingers and moving of their own volition. Motes of light began to sprout from the air, and were sucked into the phantasmal loom. Miko did not take his focus off of where Rick had gone, however, his eyes sharply focused on the sky above.<br><br>"Oh ****," Miko growled beneath his breath as Rick began his diving attack. Miko had been expecting long-ranged combat, not a full out physical rush from above. Miko ended his casting with a jerk of his arm, and a new ring, this one transparent, glimmered into existance on his left hand.<br><br>"Mogu..." Miko concentrated, and there was a gigantic flicker of red in the air. The summon didn't attack Rick as it blinked into existance, but merely grazed him with its bulk. The blow deflected the youth about three paces to the side, Rick's focus and drive allowing him to ignore the actual impact. He continued plummeting, correcting his angle despite the disruption.<br><br>The Summoner let his beast fade, and brought up his right hand, another barely visible barrier forming directly in the path of Rick's swing. The sword seemed to pause for an instant, and then jerked as it tore through the field roughly. There was a noise like stone crumbling as the forcefield shattered, Rick's attack cleaving it in half. The delay bought Miko enough time to get out of the direct path, but the sword still came within a foot of him, and flames licked at his side.<br><br>Not maintaining any pretense of invulnerability, Miko clutched at the wound. Blood seeped through his fingers, dripping to the rugged stone beneath his feet. <i>He was using fire... But it </i>CUT<i> me? How on earth did that-</i> Miko's thoughts were disrupted by another swing, this one with less force, but much harder to predict. Miko shifted his weight, jumping into a backflip away from the mage. As he landed, he transitioned into forwards movement, rushing at Rick and preparing to throw a high kick to the boy's chin.<br><br>OOC: Remember, Miko'll try to guard swordblows with his bracer. Though with the power Rick's throwing around, I could see a direct hit damaging if not destroying it outright. Then I really don't have many options in close quarters.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Hamuu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Rick had been readying another swing when the foot connected with his chin. Pain exploded in his head, much worse than before. The blow from before still stung and now this new injury on his chin created a vice like sensation, pressure building around his brain.<br><br><i>Pain… How invigorating. Just like old times wouldn’t you agree.</i><br><br>“I told you to **** off,” Rick spat, louder than before not taking into account the others could hear him now. <br><br><i>He’s fast you know, a lot faster than you. You may be part andalite, but our fathers speed was obviously not inherited.</i><br><br>“Don’t talk about my father!” <br><br>Ricks aura flared intensely as his rage generated more power for him to feed on. Black energy emanated visibly from the mage, licking at the air like flames. Glowing lines floated around his wrists forming glyphs that pulsed red, yellow, blue, and black. <br><br>“Thundara!” Ricks voice boomed. <br><br>Orbs of electrical energy formed in his palms though he kept them pointed at the ground. <br><br>“Let’s see if this magic fits in more with what you’ve heard.” Rick said as he discharged a continuous stream of electricity from his palms into his shadow. All around them the forest erupted as lightning strikes leapt and crackled out of every shadow, large or small. The trees closest to the two combats erupted into splinters as Rick discharged the most electricity through those shadows, each splinter created its own shadow that spewed forth electricity. Bolts flew chaotically igniting trees and scaring the ground. Beads of sweat formed on Rick’s brow but he refused to stop.<br><br><i>That’s cheating.</i> The voice inside Rick hissed gleefully, <i>Shadowcasting combined with Thundara… No, even better - you’re not spreading it out among each shadow you’re combining all the shadows into a single door; doubling the strength of the attack more times than I can count. I didn’t even know that was possible. It must be tiresome to combine all the shadow-paths into a single one. Why don’t you rest, I’ll take over from here.</i><br><br>“Go… to… Hell…” Rick managed between breaths. He could feel it now, he was struggling to keep the electricity going, but now the monster inside was testing Ricks hold on him.<br></div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Yoshimitsu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"You know what, no," Yoshimitsu said, concentrating briefly. While one minute he was there, the next he was gone, a blurry image of him left behind. He was immediately stood in front of Miko, his brow furrowed as he concentrated, summoning his power into a barrier around not only him, but the South Pole Summoner behind him. An invisible barrier formed around him, the lightning that Rick was forming simply being absorbed and strengthening the barrier further.<br><br>"You know what you're handling now," Yoshimitsu said quickly, aimed at Miko. Again, he vanished, leaving a bluury image and a much weaker barrier in his place, reappearing  at Hector's side.<br><br>"Don't give me that look, Hec," Yoshimitsu said as Hector looked at him incredulously. "Miko's good, but a helping hand here and there can't hurt. I'm not seeing him lose."</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Hamuu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message"><i>See, that’s why cheaters never prosper.</i><br><br>Rick cursed and abandoned his current tactic. The electricity bounding across the island faded leaving a long black scar that stretched from one side to the other. Dotted here and there were piles of burning wood sunk into crater. <br><br>“Don’t interfere!” Rick bellowed towards Yoshimitsu before launching himself at Miko. <br><br>The glyphs surrounding Rick’s wrist spun wildly as he forced them together. When he was close enough the mage skidded to a halt and yelled, “Demi!”<br><br>A black vortex formed in front of the mage spinning violently. Light, air, fire, debris, and everything else around them began to shift and move towards the gaping void. It was slow at first but the speed increased exponentially. Rick steadied himself to keep from losing his balance as large chunks of ground were swallowed up by demi. <br><br><i>What are you doing? You’re stronger than that, you could have sucked up the entire island with that spell. Why are you holding back?</i><br><br>Rick ignored the voice and continued to focus the increasing suction in Mikos direction. <br><br>OOC - BTW, El that comment that Yoshi made about being able to handle Rick was a cocky comment right? </div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">OOC: Oh, screw this. I'm not going to wait to repair my comp to post here.<br><br>BIC: Miko raised his hand as if to prepare a spell, only to have Yoshimitsu interpose on his behalf. As the lightning struck the shield, Miko began to craft another spell. Even if somebody else was covering for him, a lull was a lull. Any pause was a chance for further preparations.<br><br>"I agree with Rick, at least on that. No more interference, from anybody. I'm trying to accomplish something here, and if I don't do it alone, it's pointless," Miko clenched his fist, the spell congealing into a ring in his palm. As Yoshimitsu moved aside, Miko turned and whispered. "Thanks, though. I owe you one."<br><br>Turning back to face Rick, he saw the beginnings of the spell. He didn't feel the first tugs, but soon, the air currents were easy enough to read. The spell was like a miniature vortex, sucking in the things around and hopefully dispatching him... Miko smashed the ring into the wrist of his other arm, grunting involuntarily from the pain. The emerald powder sunk into the fabric, small sprouts growing from it as it went. The Summoner dropped to the ground, clinging desperately as Yoshimitsu's weaker shield dissipated under the stress, and stones the size of tennis balls began to be wrenched loose and pulled into the darkness.<br><br>A large, flat rock, easily the size of a dinner plate, was torn loose from beneath one of the trees. It went spinning by Miko's head, and he only barely dodged it. The jagged corner ripped a crimson line across his temple, the blood trickly freely from the wound. Miko simply gritted his teeth, and bore down harder. If he could just last until...<br><br>He felt an odd, almost ticklish sensation as the vines slithered down his arm and dug into the stone. Now, he was anchored. That was good enough. If the vortex could draw him in now, it'd have to be strong enough to tear him limb from limb, outright.<br><br>Rising to his feet with much more confidence, Miko simply gestured towards Rick for him to come after him. The Summoner's white teeth were bared in a taxxed grin, his arms tensed and ready. His right was raised, evidently ready to guard himself if Rick charged, while his left, somewhat behind him, clutched at the vines that tethered him to the earth.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Hamuu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">“That was the worst thing you could have done Miko,” Rick said as he shifted the vortex to point down at the ground. <br><br>“Impact!” the mage snarled in a low tone as he flung the vortex into his shadow.

Man Impact seemed so cool when I first thought it up but now I am a little disappointed with it. <br></div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">The instant that Rick focused on his shadow, Miko’s lips drew into a grimace. He immediately tumbled sideways, as if pulled the vines on his arm had tugged him out of harm’s way. He threw himself to the ground, rolling with the impact. The explosion’s force battered him, but he kept moving. Miko tumbled to his feet, and immediately spun around. His cape billowed in the wind, masking his movements for a brief moment.<br><br>Three crescents of azure light shot through his cape, each one roughly as wide as a tire. One shot harmlessly into the sky, its twin at a similar angle into the ground, and the middle one streaked directly towards Rick. Not pausing to see if the blade had struck, Miko spiraled again. Bracing his left arm with his right, he swung with as much strength as he could muster.<br><br>A television-sized chunk of the island, snared by the anchoring plants, and then cut free of the earth by the blade, arced towards Rick. It shot over his head and a split second later, jerked back, aimed directly at the base of his neck. Miko extended his left hand impartially, beckoning, and the vine retracted. The makeshift flail shot back to his grasp, the Summoner jolting slightly as he caught it.<br><br>“Don’t underestimate me, Rick. I do everything I can to live up to my position,” Miko stood proud, his jaw set. What he didn’t expose was that the expression was to hide locked teeth, bearing the pain from the wounds Impact had dealt him. A chunk of wood big enough to stake a vampire had stabbed him in the right shoulder beneath his cape, and his left calf looked like in had taken a shotgun blast from a distance. He carefully adjusted his cape to hide his injuries by shifting his shoulders, keeping the rock clenched tightly in his grasp.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Rick no longer had the energy to move after his last attack. The arc of energy sliced through the air with deadly speed but ultimately dissipated upon coming in contact with the mage’s aura.<br><br><i>Just so you know, that was me saving our ass.</i><br><br>Black flames erupted from Rick’s aura and surrounded his body. It was not him but the other soul now dumping its energy into his body. At least Rick was still in control of his body, but it wouldn’t last. If he remained in this state, the demon within him would take full control.<br><br>The Diablo flared back to life in a glint of black flame and steal. With unnatural speed, Rick closed the gap and made to strike Miko down with the magical mage blade. Sparks showered around the two as the summoner blocked the mage’s sword. The two stood there pushing against the other as sparks and energy rained down around them.<br><br>OOC: Sorry it took so long Lee, but you know what to do know. <br></div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Urgh!" Miko strained against the blow, letting the vines on his left arm crumbled to dust. He through the stone aside, ignoring his instinct to throw it at Rick's leg, and used his freed hand to reinforce his guard. The summoner dug his heels into the ground, putting all of his weight into resisting the attack.<br><br>"I told you... Rick.... This isn't some effort to stop my evildoing. If you were trying to do that, there's better ways to go about it," Miko felt pressure against his arm... The blade was actually pushing through the armor of his bracer.<br><br>"All that you're doing here is throwing a fit over the jerks that I've associated with killing your friends and family..." Miko pinched two of his knuckles together, ready to crush the rings. He felt the warmth of blood flowing down his back, the wound in his should starting to ooze freely.<br><br>"And I've gotta say... Grow up already! This isn't going to undo any of the pain that's happened before, yours, or anybody elses' for that matter! Live with it! Learn from it!" Miko shifted his weight, forcing Rick's attack off balance, and attempted to break the lock by circling around behind him.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">“No you don’t!” Rick shouted as he spun around and swung his sword at the summoner, forcing him into another lock. <br><br><i>You have the power to kill him, do it!</i><br><br>Rick ignored the voice and brought his face close to Miko, “You don’t get it! This isn’t about misplaced aggression. You were a monster Miko, you destroyed Slateport and killed thousands when you tasted the extent of your power. I have to know that you feel remorse for those you killed, that your soul is capable of surviving such an act. I have to know that when I become the monster that I can still come back…”<br><br>For the first time since their battle began Rick showed true fear in his eyes. It wasn’t fear of Miko, but fear of what Rick himself might become one day if he couldn’t conquer his own power.<br><br><i>You should have used the last of your strength to kill him, instead you wasted it holding me in my cage. Now, it’s my turn.</i><br><br>Rick suddenly felt himself plummeting through darkness and knew he’d lost his internal struggle. Externally the mage was undergoing changes. His hair grew down to the middle of his back as it shifted from blue to black and weaved itself into a braid. The color in his irises drained leaving only white circle around his dark pupils.<br><br>“Hi!” Rick heard himself say to Miko, “Allow me to help you into hell.”<br><br><i>No! Stop!</i><br><br>“Shut up weakling,” this new Rick said as he jerked his head to the right, “you had your chance.”<br><br>Rick turned his attention back to Miko, “After I kill you, I’ll take out those other guys too! Should be fun, plus I think I see a girl or two.” The mage winked in a sickening way before adding, “You are an unfortunate guy. He wasn’t going to kill you at all. Me on the other hand, well like I said…” <br><br>With a sharp push Rick knocked Miko back and brought his sword up to finish the fight.  <br></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"What the fuck?" Yoshimitsu asked. The question was aimed at Mia, but his eyes were locked on Rick. As soon as he felt that power, a sudden change in what Rick could control, he had tensed up, his body reacting despite his mind not knowing what was happening. Already, he had drawn both of his swords, but he was not about to enter the fray. What he could feel coming from Rick could be described only as evil.<br><br>"What just happened?"</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Hamuu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Mia bit her lip as a sickly feeling spread throughout her body, “It’s called the dissociative soul. The chaotic nature of black magic tears a chunk of the soul away and uses it as an anchor so the mage can control the dark magic. But over time the soul develops its own personality and is corrupted by the nature of their power. In most black mages it is nothing more than an evil voice in their head. Over time they would either learn to control it or, if they were completely successful, merge with it. Merging would allow him or her to reach the peak of their power.”<br><br>The white mage wobbled slightly but managed to shakily remain standing. “But Rick is different; he’s half black mage and half andalite. His potential goes far beyond any of the black mages or andalites who came before him and thus his dissociative soul is that much more powerful.” Mia took a deep breath and continued, “When we met he told me that the struggle was so bad that he literally split into two different bodies when he was a teenager. He thought he had conquered the soul when the two bodies finally merged back together.”<br><br>“But it appears he was mistaken,” a tear rolled down her cheek, “and it’s Shin-Ra’s fault. It was the other mages who cast the black mage tribes out of the city and eventually decided to purge them from their race. Because of them Rick is the last of his people and has no idea what to do in ordered to heal his warring souls. The mages of Shin-Ra created the very monster they feared the black mages would become.”<br></div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Yoshimitsu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"So what you're telling me is," Yoshimitsu said slowly. "Whatever that thing is, it's controlling Rick? And... it's aiming to kill. Is there anything Rick can do now before things get out of hand?"<br><br>"<i>Miko, I hope to God you know what you're doing.</i>"</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Hamuu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">“I’m not sure,” Mia struggled to breathe as the intense aura continued to washed over her, “Before Rick had to constantly concentrate on fighting back the dissociative soul while simultaneously fighting Miko. It would be like fighting with half your powers and one arm tied behind your back. But this Rick has no reason to hold back, he’ll focus everything on his target.”<br><br>“I’m not sure how much control Rick has, but his is the dominate soul of the body. If we can knock him out he’ll regain control again.” Mia, no longer able to stand, fell to her knees. This Rick cared nothing for her and was not bothering to subdue his aura. For her it was like poison invading her body and, if this battle didn’t end soon, it would kill her. <br></div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Yoshimitsu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Yoshimitsu could feel the power flowing from Rick. It was just so intense, so raw and strong. It was the kind of power than should be both respected and feared. But at the same time, he was vaguely registering Mia's weakening voice. Taking his eyes from the battling before him for a second, he saw Mia lose her ability to stand. With amazing reflexes, he caught the girl before she could hit the ground, and lowered her gently.<br><br>"Can Miko do it? Can Miko stop him?" Yoshimitsu asked. He raised his hand and pointed his palm at Mia, focusing briefly. A green glow covered his hand. He was trying to heal Mia, using only as much healing power as he dared. Already, he could tell that Mia was reacting to Rick's new power in an unpredictable way. If the healing showed any signs of being harmful, he would desist immediately.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Hamuu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Mia breathed in deeply a few times as some amount of strength returned. “Thank you, but it’s futile. The moment you stop it’ll just start happening again, for it to truly be effective you’d have to constantly heal me and that would drain to much power. If Miko can’t handle him, our only chance to save them both is for one of you to get me close enough to use a healing spell on him. I don’t think I have the strength to do a long range spell, I’d have to physically touch him.”</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Yoshimitsu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"That wont be a problem," Yoshimitsu said He frowned slightly, strengthening the healing since it did not seem to be causing harm. "Either things. I can keep up a low power healing for a while, and when it comes to getting close to Rick... Well, I haven't ever been beaten in a race, and I don't intend to start losing now."<br><br>OOC- I love that Hector's apparently just stood there, oblivious.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"A monster, huh?" Miko clicked the rings together again, smiling grimly. Green strings of light began to spiral around him, curling and branching as the Summoner increased his focus. Miko focused his strength, jumping as high as he could manage backwards. He paused in midair, resting on an invisible screen, and watched Rick rush at him. At the last moment, Miko vaulted over the brutal strike, and stopped again, resting on another forcefield he had conjured in midleap.<br><br>"Considering what you're saying, I think that you're going about this completely wrong-" Miko threw a glimmer to the ground, and stepped back. Rick's next slash nicked the edge of the forcefield, sending shards of it spraying up.<br><br>"Of course, to set you right..." Miko drew a line upwards with his left index finger. The ground, now a solid ten feet below, was torn apart as a gigantic green vine shot up. Miko caught onto it as it punched through the forcefield, riding it as it climbed skywards. He squinted, dust blowing past his face as the stalk continued rushing the heavens.<br><br>"I think that I'm far enough clear now..." Miko jumped free of the stalk, pausing on yet another platform. He glared at Rick, the black mage now flying to pursue him, sword at the ready.<br><br>"Crush him," Miko closed his open hand, and the titanic vine immediately stopped growing. Its tip bent back down, like a snake readying to strike, and the plunged at Rick. It missed, hammering into the ground about a pace to the right of where he had been. The mage continued his flight, readying his blade to cleave into the Summoner-<br><br>He stopped, caught by the trailing loop of vine. Like a freight train, it barrelled down, carrying the mage down under its unimaginable bulk. The vine slammed into the earth with explosive force, not even slowng for Rick's efforts to resist it. As it struck the earth, the ocean around surged outwards, hammered away by the force. A cloud of debris flew up, bits of stinging stone rainging down even upon the spectators.<br><br>"If you get up after that-" Miko's crimson eyes glared down, watching for signs of activity in the devastation wrought by his spell. His left hand still worked open and closed, as if anticipating the enemy to attack again.<br><br>OOC: Please don't be defeated by that attack. I wanna do another round or two against full-power Rick so you can really strut your stuff. After that... Well, the plot will need to move, so somebody's going to have to lose.<br><br>Oh, and if you're wondering what Hector's doing, he's probably busy looking up Mia's dress, knowing him...</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">An explosion of flame incinerated a large chunk of the vine as Rick stood up and laughed, “You scuffed up my shirt you prick.”<br><br>The mage looked up at Miko as though he wasn’t sure what to do next. “I would love to play with, I really would. That being said, I think I am gonna have to cut this short.” Rick smiled as his body sunk into his shadow and disappeared. <br><br><i>If you do it, we’ll die.</i><br><br>“Ha!” Rick laughed as he floated through the darkness, “You underestimate your own body and what it’s capable of. Now shut the f*ck up while I concentrate. Five is good number don’t you think?”<br><br>Rick burst out of the shadow of a large tree and hovered slightly above the ground as he waited. Four more Ricks exited nearby shadows and joined him.<br><br>“Interesting.”<br><br>“Yes, if not somewhat maddening…”<br><br>“Well what are we waiting for?”<br><br>“Yeah! Let’s rip his head off!”<br><br>The Ricks cackled as they shot off into the air towards Miko, each one reading his respective sword. <br></div></div>

Not a problem, though.<br><br>BIC: "Yeah? Please tell me how this puts me in any greater danger..." Miko dropped to his knees, punching the forcefield beneath him. The barrier shattered instantly, releasing the Summoner into a freefall.<br><br>"Here!" Miko extended a hand, a ring exploding into a green blur. The vine snagged one of the Ricks around the torso, and a moment later, Miko followed it. The movement so fast that he couldn't discern the features of his target, the Summoner threw his weight to the side. The cartwheel maneuver spun him under the blade of the Rick, and Miko righted himself as he closed in. Using the last acceleration the retracting snare had to offer, Miko brought up his knee. He slammed into the mage's face with a bone crunching impact, jarring both of the aerial combatants with the force of the blow. Miko willed the vine to sever, and lashed out with a kick.<br><br>He flipped away from the first one, and heard the cackling laughter of another one closing in from his left side. He spun, catching the swing on his bracer, and using the momentum to circle around into a vicious roundhouse kick. Though not as decisive as the first strike had been, it struck cleanly and threw Miko clear again. <i>So far, so good...</i><br><br>Miko paused, sensing for his opponents for only a split second, and realized the trap that he had fallen into. He pointed his hand upwards, forming a quick barrier, and then shoved off of it. A sword from either side barely missed,  the one to his right still clipping his arm well enough to draw a spatter of blood. Above, against the barrier, a wave of flames crashed down. Sizzling for a moment before growing in intensity, the fire spell hammered his barrier like the wrath of a deity.<br><br>"And now..." A flash of red appeared for an instant, snagging Miko and flinging him back towards the sky. As it faded from existance again, the flames punched through the barrier and crushed into the island like a bomb from above, right where Miko had been a second earlier.<br><br>The summoner rode the force of the throw, twisting it into another flip. He adjusted his course, and attempted to land with both feet on the head of the Rick that had flung the spell at him.<br><br>OOC: Just tryin' to get it back down to one on one. <img src="//images.proboards.com/f/smiley/wink.png" alt=";)" class="smile"></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Rick was crushed beneath the force of the impact, but strangely his body evaporated into a strange black mist which split into four separate clouds. They wafted through the air and entered the other Rick’s through the nose and mouth. <br><br>“Tasty!” one of the Rick’s yelled.<br><br>“Let finish this and kill the other’s.” the Rick closest to Miko ordered. <br><br>Two of the remaining four joined him on either side. Dust flew up around them as they sped towards their target for a head on attack. <br><br>“No you don’t!” the fourth Rick yelled as he came down hard on the center Rick. <br><br>He reached out and grabbed the heads of the other two, his force sending them all down to the ground and a massive heap. The fourth Rick catapulted up and landed near Miko. <br><br>“You should have split me up too, like you did yourself.” Rick spit at the other hims. <br><br>The three of them stood and brandished their swords. Their mouths moved indicating they were planning something. With a cackle the two nearest Miko and Rick launched themselves toward the. The third smiled and sunk into his shadow.<br><br>“Their getting tired,” Rick breather to Miko, “One good attack will finish them off.” <br><br>Yoshimitsu’s shadow rippled as the third Rick burst from it and attempted to engulf them all in a cascade of flames. <br><br>OOC: This is a load of crap.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Shit!"<br><br>The Rick that had come from Yoshimistu's shadow caught the blue haired warrior by surprise. However, he had been on edge this entire fight, so he instinctively reacted. With a powerful blast of wind he forced both Hector and Mia out of harm's way, hoping that Hector might have the sense to prevent any further injury to Mia. The flames came, but Yoshimitsu knew how to deal with it. He raised his palms, focusing as hard as he could. The flames seemed to flow towards Yoshimitsu's hands, condensing themselves so that they became harmless.<br><br>Hector landed smoothly. He was surprisingly agile, despite having been hit by a hurricane-force wind. As soon as he landed, he was on the move, diving in front of Mia before she could hit the ground in a slightly more painful fashion.<br><br>"One of the clones, are you?" Yoshimitsu asked conversationally, raising his swords as he hopped backwards. "And attacking a stationary, distracted target too. I'm not impressed."<br><br>With a flash, Yoshimitsu summoned Bahamut into his swords, the dragon possessing them as he had before. Without any hesitation, Yoshimitsu threw himself into a violent spin, bringing both swords round repeatedly at the Rick clone whilst simultaneous releasing sheets of gold and blue flames from both blades. Even if the initial swings didn't hit, there would still be a wave of fire to cope with.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Hamuu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Rick watched as Yoshimitsu quickly dispatched the Shadow Rick that had attacked him. The mage felt no remorse but it was odd seeing himself explode into a cloud of black dust that flew through the air and into the remaining three’s noses. <br><br>As he turned his attention back towards the remaining two, Rick whispered to Miko, “Our fight isn’t over and someday we’ll have to finish it. For now though, if you have something that can end this do it.” <br><br>Rick kicked off the ground and flew at his duplicates, ready to intercept and buy the summoner time. <br><br>~<br><br>Mia landed gently in Hectors arms. She smiled faintly in thanks just as the energy radiating off the Shadow Rick washed over her. Unable to withstand the pain any longer she began uncontrollably vomiting blood and bile. His destruction brought her minor relief but she had already slipped into unconsciousness. <br><br>~<br><br>Rick parried the blows easily; after all, he knew all the same moves that his shadow selves did. Unfortunately that meant anytime he tried to turn the fight in his favor the duplicates had the same advantage. It seemed that the current situation was locked in a stalemate. <br><br>Even when Rick tried to recall the fights he had with himself the first time his body split he still couldn’t find an answer. Then he had split into two different entities – a body representing his father’s heritage and another representing his mother’s, neither was necessarily evil but acted on instincts. <br><br>This fight though, it was as if the process had matured with him. Now the Shadow Ricks were perfect forms of himself controlled by either him or his dark side. But good things had come of this confrontation, most of all he had found that he could use shadowcasting to not only amplify his attacks but also split himself. Unfortunately until he had defeated his inner dark side it would be too risky to use. <br><br>Surprisingly though he found himself doubting everything he knew about Miko. He may never be able to forgive the summoner for his actions, but he might hold the key to Rick finally conquering his own soul. <br><br>“Now!” the closest Shadow Rick shouted.<br><br>The two brought their feet back and kicked into their shadows, reaping in Ricks shadow and knocking his feet out from under him. In the same instant, he felt his sword knocked from his hands. As he struck the ground, he could see them looming over him as the brought down their swords down on his head.<br><br>“Nice try,” Rick said as he laid there, blood draining down his arms from having blocked the swords with his hands. <br><br>“You let us…?” the second Shadow Rick questioned.<br><br>Rick smiled as flecks of glitter like snow floated around the three of them, “Yeah I let you.”<br><br>Immediately the two attempted to retreat, obviously knowing what spell Rick was about to cast. <br><br>“Ultima.” Rick said as the glittery snow transformed into flaring balls of energy. Like small comets, they flew through the air and centered on the two Ricks. Using all his concentration Rick held the second part of the spell back. Waiting for Miko, what ever he did would get a nice explosive boost from Ultima. <br></div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Yoshimitsu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Fuck," Yoshimitsu muttered, shooting from his position like a bullet. The attack from the shadow Rick had caused his to stop his healing, meaning that Mia was once again being affected by the black magic that Rick was using. As quickly as his body would allow, he tried to get back to Mia, praying that she was alright. <br><br>"Hector, put her down and step back," Yoshimitsu ordered. Hector immediately did so. He knew already that Yoshimitsu could get very testy when such a serious order was disobeyed, and he did not want to be on the receiving end. Yoshimitsu sheathed his swords, clapped his hands together and started focusing. Mia, as far as he could tell, knew the most about the situation at hand, so if things got out of control (like they appeared to be doing), he knew that she would be able to tell him how he could help.<br><br>Yoshimitsu extended his palms at Mia, a green glow covering them. Immediately, the glow covered Mia, a healing power on a much higher level than what had been used before. He knew that he only had to help Mia back to consciousness, then he could lower the flow. Until that point, though, he'd heal her with the best of his ability.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">A soft light had been forming above the battlefield, only now noticable. It shone like a hazy sun, its luminosity casting an faint chartreuse glow through a forcefield Miko had created. Bits and flecks of spring-green light came sweeping up in arching pathways, starting in the sea and darting around like fish before being caught up.<br><br>Miko stomped with one foot, the barrier beneath him shattering into innumerable shards. While Rick had been holding off his duplicates, his hands had been moving with supernatural speed and surety. With the filter gone, the battlefield was sharply lit. Normal shadows were gone, the accumulated energy dwarfing the relative brilliance of the sun. The summoner hung suspended, seemingly supported merely by the mana that he had gathered for the attack.<br><br><i>This spell... The only one in Jade Magic powerful enough to require a verbal component to control it...</i> Miko swung his feet, managing to pull himself into a backflip. His hands pulled free from the orb with a snapping noise, like an elastic breaking.<br><br>He landed atop it, taking one moment to catch his breath. The gathered power started to shift in color, growing darker and more towards a shade of cyan than green. A rustling, like billions of leaves on the wind, began eminating from inside it.<br><br>"This is the last blow, Rick," Miko threw a punch, hammering the ball. It didn't explode, crack, or break like his prior forcefields had. Instead, it blossomed outwards. Hundreds of blades, similar to the ones he had been slinging at Rick earlier, now emerged, and ruffled outwards as countless more spilled from the interior. They expanded until forming a design the size of a city block, perfectly symetrical and without flaws.<br><br>To those below, it appeared as a titanic blue rose, each petal shining with a soft light. The rustling went silent, leaving only the voice of the waves.<br><br>"The ultimate technique of Jade Magic, Lan Yizhi Meiguihua!" Miko opened his fist, and placed his palm upon the center of the flower's back. It scattered, the blades losing the cohesion and flying out around the battlefield. Right as it looked certain they'd indiscriminately destroy the spectators, though, they all turned back in.<br><br>Each blade grew as it hit the area infused with the Ultima, expanding from the size of hubcaps to a measure almost equal with a dining room table. Each one, as it struck, plowed deeply into the ground, and then exploded with enough force to make the coral island shudder. Gigantic waves rolled outwards from the focus of the spell,  making their boat bob and shudder in the sudden violence of the sea.<br><br>The hammer blows increased in tempo, soon absolutely filling the air over the atoll. The shadow Rick attempted to ward them off, but even with his incredible might, was covered in gashes and was missing his right arm below the elbow. He glared upwards at Miko, panting.<br><br>"Damn you, Summoner scu-"<br><br>"Finish," Miko clenched his fist. The remaining blades swept in, aimed directly at the Black Mage. He attempted to jump over them, only to have them swoop back upwards and tear through him. He tumbled to the ground, body broken, and proceeded to start to stand once more.<br><br>There was a loud thud as Miko plummeted from the skies, landing between Rick and his double. He threw down a ring, an invisible wall forming between his group and the doppleganger right as the second burst from Ultima occured.<br><br>Bits of stone and steam errupted in all directions as a massive azure flash enveloped the island. Sealife was boiled instantly and the air roiled back in a shockwave. There was a roar that bellowed out over the ocean, enough to be heard back in Olivine.<br><br>A mist of the boiled seawater and dust choked the air as the last of the spell dissipated. All that the watchers could make out was a hunched figure, breathing heavily. Yoshimitsu waved a hand, a gust of wind parting the clouds.<br><br>"Thanks..." Miko tentatively stood up, shaky on his legs. Though his cape mostly concealed it, the back of his uniform was drenched in blood. The camo green had become a sickly wet brown, the water around him picking up traces of crimson.<br><br>The emperor of the Summoners knelt down, and tried to elevate Rick as best he could. The black mage was prone, his breathing heavy and ragged. Miko couldn't be certain if he was conscious or not. Though he had directed his attack entirely against the copy, just being near it was easily enough to kill a lesser being that was unprotected...<br><br>Miko growled slightly, under his breath, and turned to the others. Issabelle was peering over Yoshimitsu's muscled shoulders, concern in her eyes.<br><br>"That is how you do Jade-" Miko coughed, and winced as the movement hit his injury, "Magic. Yoshimitsu, I... Well, if you could get us back to the boat, it'd be greatly appreciated."</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Yoshimitsu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">The combined force of the spells was staggering. Incredible. Overwhelming. Yoshimitsu braced himself while trying to maintain his flow of healing on Mia. Hector, next to him, erected a wall of flames and covered both his friend and the white mage with his body. Even then, the force blasting out of the spells nearly broke them. Without conscious though, Yoshimitsu thrust his palm out at the wall of fire and froze it solid, a block of ice at least a meter thick protecting the trio.<br><br>Thankfully, the defense lasted just long enough. As the last of the ripples from the combat shattered the wall, Yoshimitsu turned his attention to the outcome. Rick was unconscious, Miko was injured and Mia was still down for the count. The mist that had risen was obscuring, and Yoshimitsu casually sent a powerful gust of wind to erase it.<br><br>"Thanks..." He heard Miko say, his voice weaker than Yoshimitsu was used to. <br><br>"Hector, make sure she's okay," Yoshimitsu ordered, running to Miko. Rick was in bad shape, and Miko was barely any better.<br><br>"Yoshimitsu, I... Well, if you could get us back to the boat, it'd be greatly appreciated."<br><br>"No problem, Miko," Yoshimitsu said as he raised his palm to the sky. Instantly, the massive blue dragon formed, his wings beating softly as he hovered above the scene. "Bahamut, me, Miko and Hec'll get on your back. Can you carry Rick and Mia?"<br><br>After receiving confirmation, Yoshimitsu put Miko's arm over his shoulder. The summoner was in no fit state to jump on to Bahamut, so the blue haired teenager helped him. Moments later, they were on their way back to the boat.<br><br>"Stay still. This isn't a perfect art," Yoshimitsu ordered Miko, pointing his palms at the summoner. Instantly, a green glow covered both Yoshimitsu's hands and Miko's wounds. Skin knitted itself back together. "It's not healing, not really. It's more like speeding up time. Good for light to moderate cuts, sometimes deep wounds. No good for broken bones."<br><br>Yoshimitsu looked Miko in the eye.<br><br>"What do you think?" His question was vague, but his intonation was hinting at Rick and the outcome of the battle.</div></div>

He'll be working Terrian into this topic somehow.<br><br>BIC: "I don't know what to think, really," Miko responded, glancing around warily. The last thing he needed was for even more people to get pulled into the conflict. In a bit, he'd come up with a good way to explain what happened for the people who had stayed on the ship.<br><br>As for right now, "He called me genocidal monster, so I killed him a couple times over and then left him near death," was <i>not</i> exactly the greatest of excuses, or the most flattering.<br><br>"It's... bad that he wanted to fight with me, in the first place.

I had hoped that he wasn't quite that far gone. I was hoping that he would hear my words well enough to stop, to reconsider starting a lethal battle before somebody got hurt." Miko winced slightly as a few pieces of grit extracted themself from his wound. Yoshimitsu was inhibiting the pain, but like all pain killers, it had some limit.<br><br>"So, I guess my initial evaluation was off. He hates me more than he cares about the rest of you guys, even if some of you worked with him before. That's not good," Miko stood up, un-clasping his cape. He slipped it from his shoulders, and carefully folded it.<br><br>"But, when those evil- errr, well, evil <i>things</i> showed up, he actually decided to work with me. That's the most important thing to think on, here. He hates me more than he cares about a bunch of innocent strangers, but he-" Miko smiled bitterly.<br><br>"Still hates me less than he loves that girl. I'll need to thank her when she's better.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"All in all, a pretty grim result," Yoshimitsu commented, hearing Miko's unsaid words. It was fascinating, in a morbid way, to witness the fight. He imagined it was like witnessing himself and his darkness fighting, the brutality and resolve warring and destroying. It was grim, repulsive, depressing to realize that Yoshimitsu understood on more levels than he would have liked a few years ago.<br><br>"It's not that bad. Hatred goes away," Yoshimitsu said calmly. "I mean, he might not have heard you before but he might consider it now. That's better than nothing, right?"<br><br>Yoshimitsu considered Mia for a moment.<br><br>"I'm worried about her," Yoshimitsu admitted, gesturing to the girl. "She kind of explained why being so close to Rick was killing her, but she hasn't shown any kind of recover. I tried healing her before and it worked, but now she's just... "<br><br>Yoshimitsu turned his thoughts to Rick instead.<br><br>"Just what <i>is</i> he anyway?"</div></div>

Yoshimitsu carried Miko smoothly, the leap down looking effortless and their landing silent. Hector followed quickly after, his descent much less graceful. As soon as he was sure everyone had made it back safely, he gestured at the dragon. Bahamut faded away immediately.<br><br>"C'mon Hec," Yoshimitsu muttered to the blonde, grabbing his elbow and dragging him away from the others. He knew there would be a discussion, though probably an argument, about the events from the island and he had no intention of sitting in on that. Instead, he walked to the other side of the boat as Hector rejoined his family. The blue haired teenager stood by the railings, watching the waves below.<br><br>"So did you learn what you wanted to from that fight?" Hector asked, appearing at Yoshimitsu's side.<br><br>"More or less. Their power is terrifying. I'd hate to pick a fight with either of them," Yoshimitsu replied. "Still, it's comforting to know just what they're capable of."<br><br>"Reckon you could take them?"<br><br>"Dunno. Don't really want to find out," Yoshimitsu replied with a sarcastic smile. "Would you wanna fight them?"<br><br>"Sure, why not? As long as I had some back up," Hector answered, punching Yoshimitsu's shoulder.<br><br>"Nooooo thanks, I'll clean up the bloody smear that used to be your body," Yoshimitsu replied, smirking.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Miko had glanced up, expecting to have to produce a vine for Issabelle to shimmy down. However, after a tentative peak over the dragon's shoulder, the girl jumped down. She hit the edge of the boat's canopy, and shifted her weight. Grinding down the support, she stumbled over the side of the boat and landed on her hands and knees on the deck.<br><br><br>"Owww..." She rolled over, landing on her butt, and folded her legs, "That wasn't as fun as I thought it would be."<br><br>Miko offered her a hand, but she waved it away.<br><br>"Whatever," Miko turned away from her, towards Mia.<br><br>“Nobody died. Nothing was permanently messed up. There's no reason not to accept an apology, provided that it's sincere,” He put a hand on Mia's shoulder.<br><br>“I should be sorry too. But I don't know if he has reason to accept my apology. Maybe... Someday.”<br><br>He pulled away and stepped around her, stepping into the captain's area.<br><br>“We're ready to go now, if we can.”<br><br>The captain had been sitting quietly in a corner in a wicker chair, reading some kind of magazine. Miko could tell that it was some kind of Asian writing, but nothing that he could read. So... Not Chinese, nothing Japanese. Of course, from the tone of the man's skin, it was easy enough to guess that he was from somewhere else, probably some spot around the Indian Ocean.<br><br>“Certainly. Just a moment,” The man closed the periodical, and stood up. He set it on the seat, and then stepped up to the wheel.<br><br>“Have a destination in mind? Other than straight south, of course?”<br><br>“There's a little trading post about fifty miles south of here, I think... Not sure on exact details. It's been a long time since I've stopped there. Five years maybe.”<br><br>“Ah. Stocking up on food, I'm guessing.”<br><br>“Food, and other supplies. As you're aware, I can make some stuff for us. But it's nice to have some variation in one's diet. And...”<br><br>The captain met Miko's gaze, questioning.<br><br>“Well, I don't think Hector or Joseph would be able to stand a trip without me picking up some better booze for the ride down. Otherwise, they'd probably tear this poor boat apart.”<br><br>“Ah,” There was a spark in the man's eyes, a stiffled laugh appearing for just a moment.<br><br>“I know how that can be.” The engine of the boat started, a low, strong rumbling.<br><br>“I'm going on deck to tend to business.”<br><br>“Of course. I shouldn't need your help anyways. That island's a familiar spot for me.”<br>-------<br>“Sorry about not teaching you anything, Issabelle,” Miko leaned against the railing, throwing his head back, “We'll need to wait until we manage to get to another island. Gee... Probably two, three days from now.”<br><br>“It's okay. I got to see quite a bit,” Issabelle let the ladybug scramble up the back of her hand, its tiny feet tickling her.<br><br>“Quite a bit more than you need to see, I'd say...” Miko rubbed his shoulder. It didn't hurt anymore, as far as he could tell. Yoshimitsu had done a better job than he expected on the injury.<br><br>“Not really. If there hadn't been a fight, I wouldn't have gotten to know any of you as well as I did.”<br><br>“You're a funny girl, did you know that?”<br><br>“I guess I am. But I wouldn't be here in the first place if I wasn't, right?”<br><br>“That is right.”<br><br>“Besides, I got to try doing what you did. So if there wasn't a fight, maybe that wouldn't gone so good.”<br><br>“What?” Miko pulled himself back to his feet, and looked at the girl. She had both hands up in front of her face, pointer fingers extended. Between her fingertips, a tiny vine was stretched. A ladybug was ambling along it busily.<br><br>“You <i>really</i> are a funny girl.”<br><br>OOC: Okay, back to “Nautical rhythm”. You know, chatter between characters with lots of time breaks, etc. etc. etc.<br><br>This next island is a stop requested by El, so I guess he'll take the lead once we get there. Do we want this to be same night, or the next morning that we'll be arriving? Same night, I'd say give us two/three rounds of posts maybe. Next morning? Eh, four, five rounds. We'll see what feels right once we know what is wanted.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">OOC – I assume this is after a time skip. (Also if I remember correctly this takes place before Sly had even come back to life right? So this is still before Rick became the Second and all that other jazz)<br><br>BIC – Mia was at the bow leaning against the railing as she looked out at the water on the horizon. Since they had resumed their journey, she found she had distanced herself from the others. She was trying to sort out everything that had occurred and figure out where she stood. On the one hand she was on her first diplomatic mission representing her people. It’d been hundreds of years since they’d severed their connections with the outside world and as the Third of Shin-Ra it was her job to rebuild those lost alliances. <br><br>That’s where the conflict arose. The council had appointed Rick as her assistant to test him. He didn’t know it but she was supposed to report back to the council everything Rick did. Her report would decide his fate whether it be acceptance, exile, or execution should they decide he posed a threat. Right now his chances didn’t look so good. <br><br>Was the council testing her as well? They knew Rick and she had entered into a relationship. Mia groaned, she was conflicted between her love for Rick and her duty to the council. She pulled the small flat rock from her robe, the one she was suppose to use to communicate with the council. Carefully she inspected it then, glancing around, held it out over the water. It slipped between her fingers and plopped into the water below. <br><br>“Opps,” she said, watching it sink beneath the surface.<br><br>Mia smiled; they’d just have to wait till she got back. She’d have her heart and mind sorted out by then, hopefully. <br></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Dropping a rock never looked so suspicious."<br><br>Yoshimitsu stepped calmly towards Mia, his hands in his pockets and his stance lazy and carefree. The fight on the island had been resolved, no one had been seriously hurt and there was a chance of acceptance between two members of the voyage. In his opinion, it had ended well. The boat was a nice reprieve, he thought. The violence involved in a fight or a sparring match was fun, but allowed no chance to just relax.<br><br>"I wanted to speak to you before, but I figured you'd be more worried about Rick," he continued, standing a few meters away from the girl. He had no negative feelings towards either mage, despite how Rick had challenged Miko. Forming enemies on this voyage would be stupid anyway.<br><br>"Thanks. First, thanks. You're probably the only reason any of us made it out alive, I figure. Especially me, you and Hec," Yoshimitsu said, his voice full of warmth. "You let me know what to expect in case Rick decided to target other people. Sorry if the quick escape from the clone was a bit rough, by the way."<br><br>"I have a few questions, though," Yoshimitsu continued, his cheery face vanishing to a more serious one. "About Rick's dark side."<br><br>He waited for Mia's reaction, ready to re-evaluate his questions.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Hamuu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Dropping a rock never looked so suspicious."<br><br>Startled, Mia twirled around to face Yoshimitsu. Unsure what to say, she nodded and shrugged awkwardly. Yoshi didn’t dwell on it, instead he continued speaking. She relaxed slightly and listened to what he had to say. <br><br>“You did what you had to,” Mia told him, “As for Rick… He’s different from Black Mages we’ve record of in our archives. I don’t even know how much he understands about the problem himself…”<br></div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Yoshimitsu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Yoshimitsu pondered Mia's response for a moment, and evaluated it against what Mia had said during the fight. The idea of a separate entity within a man that was subtly, or not so subtly as the case may be, directing the individual towards a darker action. That could be the very information that Yoshimitsu wanted.<br><br>Or not. It depended on how linked the two cases might be.<br><br>"Colour me curious, I guess," he replied. "It's about this dissociative soul. You said it was a part of Rick that changed due to the nature of the black magic."<br><br>Yoshimitsu paused to collect his thoughts. It was a tricky question, he wanted to ask. During the fight, Rick had lost himself entirely to his darker side for a period but quickly regained control. It was that control he was most interested in. It might just help.<br><br>"And it changed into a more violent Rick, I guess?" It made sense to Yoshimitsu. Aspects of Rick's soul would still be there considering how the black magic had used the soul as a starting point. He was only theorizing, however.<br><br>"And because Rick's half-andalite, half-black mage, it's stronger. Just how much sway does it have over Rick? And Rick over it?"</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Hamuu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">“It’s not so much a separate entity, as it is the same entity. Neither Rick nor the other soul are complete unless they are together.” Mia folded her arms tightly, “The other soul is what Rick would have become if his body hadn’t subconsciously taken measures to prevent the black magic from corrupting him entirely.”<br><br>As Mia spoke, her floating trunk made its way toward the two and deposited itself on the deck near her. She shifted and sat down on the edge of the trunk. “Rick is the dominate of the two souls simply because he is the larger portion. The other soul can only take over when Rick loses too much energy or is knocked unconscious. It won’t happen every time though, only when the other soul is awake.<br><br>“In all the cases before Rick, there was a progression, though it was on a smaller scale. In order to use the black mage powers, the dominate soul has to go to the portion of the soul where the magic is anchored – the dissociative soul. If the powers are not used, the other soul will eventually fall into a dormant state. Using the power in small amounts here and there will keep it in this state. However, using small amounts continuously will cause it to slowly wake up over time. This would normally start out as an uneasy feeling that eventually developed into a voice. If a mage were to use a large amount all at once, the soul would immediately wake up.” Mia closed her eyes as she recalled each page she read about black mages in her mind, “In previous events, if the voice took over, which was seldom, it was more mischievous than evil. There were rare ones that would murder, but it wasn’t as bad as Rick’s situation.”<br><br>Mia looked down at her feet, “Rick is a hybrid, and that does have a lot to do with his strength. But, that really only goes so far. I met Rick’s father once and during our meeting I asked him about Rick in detail. Being a hybrid, Sly explained, Rick is genetically superior to both andalites and black mages. That’s it though,” she closed her eyes again, “his status as a hybrid has nothing to do with how magically powerful he has become compared to past black mages. I think I know why he’s the strongest and so far I have kept it from the council. I haven’t even I told Rick.”</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Yoshimitsu listened carefully. He tried to not show his disappointment. This information would not help him as much as he had hoped. Bits of it, just small bits matched up. A dormant darkness that fought for control. But it wasn't enough. Not similar enough for it to relate. No, Vincent was not tied to his darkness. It was an external force that had released the demon he had become. <br><br>"I see..." He replied, walking to the railing. He gripped it, needing something to anchor himself and his thoughts. His knuckles whitened as he tightened his grip and tried not to let his emotions spill out. It had seemed too easy, too simple, for Yoshimitsu to have acquired the answers he sought from Mia. Of course it had. He would have to rethink.<br><br>"I'm sorry, I was hoping Rick would be similar enough to my friend," Yoshimitsu said, after a few moments. He kept his gaze on the sea, choosing his words.<br><br>"I have a friend, called Vincent. It was... I guess it was about a year ago. Someone had stolen something from my past, a small part of who I used to be," he explained, his voice neutral. "It was darkness. Full of hostility and anger and hate, trapped in a pendant and waiting for something to release it. And Vincent..."<br><br>Yoshimitsu paused. It was painful for him, painful to bring up these memories. But he had to get it off his chest.<br><br>"Vincent's always been living in darkness. He was always... full of fear and anger. And then... he had me. I gave him some light, I tried to help him," Yoshimitsu continued. He turned his head slightly, not enough for Mia to read his expression. "But this thing, this pendant, all it wanted was a heart. Someone already living in darkness, someone doubting himself. It unlocked Vincent's darkness and took over his body."<br><br>Yoshimitsu paused again. There was something missing from his story.<br><br>"It was Yisimentsu. But I don't understand why, what he's trying to do," Yoshimitsu concluded. He turned his body to face Mia, one hand still firmly gripping the railing.<br><br>"Sorry. Didn't mean to unload all of that on you," he said with an apologetic smile. "I just figured you might understand."<br><br>OOC - Oh yeahhh, cohesion between RPs.

Joseph glanced to the side, noting another shadowed figure that had come into the nighttime air.<br><br>He looked back towards the stars in the nighttime skies, and had another pull.<br><br>Another cough.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Trading post, a mile away!" The captain's voice came from the canopy.<br><br>Yoshimitsu raised his head. He had taken the opportunity to power nap at the front of the boat, resting against the metal barrier. As much as he hated to admit it, the various shows of power from the last island had taken their toll on him. If all he had done was create an ice bridge, then he would have been fine. But no, he had used Bahamut, he had healed Miko, he'd sparred with Hector and he'd intervened mildly with Miko and Rick's fight. He wasn't completely exhausted, but he was definitely feeling a little drained.<br><br>Stretching as he stood, Yoshimitsu turned to look at the upcoming island. He couldn't see much from a distance. Just some lights flickering, a small amount of smoke. Probably used fire as a source of light. No big deal. A trading post. And if Yoshimitsu knew trading posts, he knew there'd be a few bars there. Any sailor needed a drink after a long voyage. A drink and a meal. Sounded good to Yoshimitsu. <br><br>There was something else, though. He just couldn't decide on what. An ominous feeling, as though someone was watching him.<br><br>"So, how're you getting across this time?" Hector asked, appearing from nowhere. "Another ice bridge?"<br><br>"Haven't decided," Yoshimitsu replied. He didn't want to be running on empty, just in case. He didn't want to rely on someone else either.<br><br>"You could wait for Miko to make another bridge," Hector suggested.<br><br>"No thanks. You know me, Hector. I like to do things on my terms," Yoshimitsu replied. Hector frowned. Now that wasn't true at all. Not the Yoshimitsu he knew.<br><br>"Okay, I guess. I'm gonna Tiamat it over, I think," Hector said, shrugging. He walked to the side of the bridge. Yoshimitsu snapped his fingers.<br><br>"Hey wait a sec!" Yoshimitsu shouted. "Tiamat, right. How are you at summoning things?"<br><br>"So-so. I can summon, after all," Hector replied, not sure where the conversation was going. <br><br>"Okay try this," Yoshimitsu started. He paused and took his t-shirt off, stowing it loosely in a pocket. "Focus on the summoning and direct it into an object. Summon Tiamat inside the object instead of just freely."<br><br>Hector raised his eyebrow.<br><br>"Is that what you did earlier?" He asked curiously.<br><br>"Yeah, it's pretty handy," Yoshimitsu answered, smiling. "Watch me."<br><br>He jumped on to the railing with good grace and clapped his hands together. Both his hands and the Bahamut Blade started glowing a vivid blue colour as Yoshimitsu focused on bringing forth the dragon. He thrust his palm out, then swung it overhead and had his other hand meet it at his hip. Instantly, the glow shifted from the sword to his upper back. Along his spine, the skin began to change into dark blue scales, two appendages growing outwards. They expanded and widened until they grew into fully formed wings. Bahamut's wings. He turned to face Hector.<br><br>"See? Piece of cake," Yoshimitsu said, hopping off the railing and beating his new wings a few times to remain in the air.<br><br>"Yeah, I guess," Hector replied skeptically.<br><br>"See you on the island!" Yoshimitsu twisted in the air and made his way across the water. The wind and salt spray on his face were pleasant, enjoyable as he cut through the air like a dagger. Yoshimitsu was a lot more graceful than his personality would suggest, his body seeming to flow through the air rather than fly. As soon as his feet touched down on the sand, the wings shrunk until they faded completely, the skin on his back completely normal. He tugged his t-shirt on and looked up towards the buildings. <br><br>"What an interesting island."<br><br>On face value, Yoshimitsu thought it looked more like an island of dance clubs. From where he was standing, he could see a number of Hawaiian style bars made up of wood with straw ceilings, mostly open top. The flames lighting the place cast a glow over the area, each flame burning a different colour and flaring unexpectedly over the top of the others. Magic, he mused. Or complex chemicals he couldn't be bothered trying to understand. Many people stood by the bars, drinking strangely coloured drinks, while many others were on the dance floors.<br><br>He didn't even bother waiting for anyone else. Yoshimitsu went straight into the bars.<br><br>~*~*~<br><br>Hector paused before he followed Yoshimitsu. It wasn't because he found the summoning trick complicated. He was slightly confused by it, but that wasn't the reason. No, the reason was Yoshimitsu. As much as he was loathed to admit it, this new Yoshimitsu surprised him. Hector thought he had known the blue haired boy but this latest interaction had forced him to conclude that he did not.<br><br>He sought out Miko.<br><br>"Hey Meeks," he greeted casually. "Yoshi's gone to the island already. Makes you think he doesn't actually want to be on the boat."<br><br>Miko nodded.<br><br>"Well, he's not the type to sit still. The boat probably isn't his favourite place to be," Miko replied.<br><br>"Guess not. D'you know what's wrong with him?" Hector asked, not even bothering to be subtle. Miko raised his eyebrow. "I mean he's not acting like himself. He's not all cool and laid-back and sassy like he should be."<br><br>Miko smoothed down his clothes before replying.<br><br>"Have you asked him?" He asked. Hector rubbed the back of his head.<br><br>"No... kinda awkward, y'know?" The blonde boy answered. "I dunno. Guess you're right."<br><br>Hector returned to the railing near the front of the boat, looking at the place where Yoshimitsu had flown to. The blue haired boy was gone. Already on the island. Hector frowned again. He thought the fighter would wait for him. He expected him to. What had made Yoshimitsu change this much?<br><br>~*~*~<br><br>"What'll it be?" The bartender asked.<br><br>"Anything to make me forget, and make it a double," Yoshimitsu replied. The bartender nodded as though he understood Yoshimitsu's problems, then busied himself pouring a variety of spirits into a glass. He returned quickly with a neon-blue concoction of some sort. Yoshimitsu reached for the pouch at his waist, but the bartender stopped him.<br><br>"On the house, kid. Next time you've gotta pay, though," the bartender said with a chuckle. Yoshimitsu guessed he should be either flattered or grateful, but honestly he just felt a little pathetic. If the bartender was taking pity on him, he must look dejected.<br><br>Yoshimitsu looked out at the dancers. He couldn't even decide why he felt so down. His energy levels had risen from his power nap, he was on good terms with the other people on the boat and he was in his favourite setting. What was making him feel so bad?<br><br>No, wait. He knew what it was.<br><br>Hector.<br><br><i>Hector.</i><br><br>Hector was reminding him of everything he needed to do and everything he couldn't be. Hector, his old best friend. Hector, who had no issues with darkness and battered souls. Hector, who had started a family and was taking everything in his stride. Yoshimitsu sipped his drink, finding it was surprisingly tasty. The warrior still had too much to do. In his future, all he could see right now was darkness. Darkness, and the fight looming on the horizon. <br><br><i>"Stop it. Stop thinking about it. Just chill out and relax. You can deal with it when you get to it. For now, just help your friends."</i><br><br>Shame he couldn't convince himself that easily.</div></div>

He examined each individual gem and transparent rock, holding the back of his left hand over each as he examined them.  He passed the hand carefully over each one, hoping for a reaction of some kind.  The empty metal recess in the back of his hand would do something if he came across a stone of appropriate design and make, if he was lucky enough.  No such luck that day, though.  As he passed his hand over the final, red ruby, he turned his greyish-blue eyes up to the man behind the display.  The cheerful, heavy man smiled and looked down at his wares.<br><br>"You find something you like?"  He asked with a thick accent that promised nothing but a slaughtering of Taylor's native tongue if he continued.  His eyes were focused on Taylor's left hand, his face and eyes pulled into a sharp, judgmental scowl.<br><br>"Sorry, but no,"  Taylor answered.  He sighed dejectedly, and stood to full height.  He slipped a leather glove back over his left hand, hiding the metal recess.  No one really liked looking at it, not even him.  Taylor turned from the stand, and dusted down his green shirt.  he didn't bother with his normal brown jacket that day, to save his body from the overbearing heat.  Of course, another preparation to be made on that island was his black side bag that hung to his right side, over the top of his brown camouflage  pants.  He patted it down twice, making sure both familiar crystals were in their place.  He looked around, and checked one last time for another gem shop.  Nothing.  Another trip was wasted.<br><br>Speaking of wasted, he needed a good drink.  To his left, an open bar.  He sauntered into the bar calmly, and placed himself next to a blue-haired man drinking some neon-blue drink.  Fitting.<br><br>"Bartender,"  Taylor called, grabbing the attention of the man.  He turned to look Taylor in the eyes.  "Gimme something hard.  I wasted a trip."  He thought for a second.  "Bourbon, actually.  No ice."<br><br>"No problem,"  The bartender called back.  He poured something amber-colored into a glass, and looked back at Taylor.  "Bourbon for the kid in green."  The bartender shot it down the brown counter top, and Taylor casually held out his hand.  He caught the liquor easily enough, and took a healthy gulp.<br><br>"Thanks,"  Taylor called, and looked over at the blue-drink next to him.  "Good choice."  He complimented.  "I like that one a lot, actually."</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Yoshimitsu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Yoshimitsu made a non-commital noise to the person who commented on his drink, not even sparing a glance. Truth be told, he did not feel altogether that social right now. Maybe a club setting was not the best choice, but it had a steady supply of alcohol and enough atmosphere that he could escape reality, even if it was just for a little while. He knew his peace was limited. Hector would be on his way soon, and probably so would everyone else. And all his responsibilities with them. Yoshimitsu tried to ignore that.<br><br>He drank a healthy-sized swig of his drink. It wasn't bad. The subtle blends of alcohols mixed with soft drinks almost concealed how potent the drink was. It was such a strange drink. It looked like toxic waste, but it tasted like happiness. Or that was what Yoshimitsu could best describe it as. Yoshimitsu turned his head.<br><br>Now what was that?<br><br>He heard a note. A violin. Someone was playing a violin? A chill surrounded him. Judging by the people around him, no one else had noticed. Which meant that the chill was meant for him. He ignored it, for now, and tapped his hand on the bar for another drink. The last thing he wanted right now was for some singing ice monster to come attack him. This was his time to escape, to ignore any threats or promises or obligations, to just be himself and relax. The alcohol was loosening him up.<br><br>The note again. The chill, like his blood was freezing up. Yoshimitsu sighed. Looks like he'd have to check this out. He downed his drink and put the glass on the counter. Without a word, he stepped away from the bar and walked through the crowd. A faint trail of mist was his path to follow. His eyes scanned, looking for the source.<br><br>~*~*~<br><br>Hector soared over the sea with his Tiamat wings. He was not as fast as Yoshimitsu, nor as graceful, but he had a certain elegance to the way he flew. It was like fire. He moved like fire. Strong, but flickering. Elegant. Dangerous. Hector left a trail in the water, the water getting caught up in his slipstream as he moved.<br><br>He was worried, worried about Yoshimitsu. The boy had changed, almost beyond recognition. The casually carefree attitude had been replaced by a more serious one. The confident swagger, the joking personality. All of it had been changed. Warped. Hector didn't like it. What could cause a person to change like that? Such a dramatic one-eighty.<br><br>The fire warrior didn't lose his wings as he reached the beach. He ripped through the air leading to the bars, finally returning to a human form just before anyone could see. Pulling his t-shirt on as he went, he began his hunt for Yoshimitsu. The place was massive. He didn't even know where to start.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Loogs</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Holy Mauna Loa, look at all these bars!" The mere sight of all the liquor--and all the ladies--excited Hector. Whatever was eating Yoshimitsu could wait until after a Jack and Coke. But where to start? He took a moment to check his hair, styled into a tall fauxhawk and dyed auburn, and proceeded to prowl the area for a suitable bar. Wait, wait wait, something's missing. He pulled out a pair of stylish aviators and put them on. NOW you're ready to party hard, Hector. Now you're ready.<br><br>He settled on an open bar with one of those kitschy-looking thatched roofs and tiki torches lit with flames of an excessively flamboyant color. One of the bartenders, an attractive redhead with her hair tied back with a bandana and a low-cut neon green tank top, approached him and asked, "What can I get ya?"<br><br>"How about a B-52? Though, getting an eyeful of you is good enough too, you blazing bombshell."<br><br>The redhead rolled her eyes and procured some bottles, pouring the coffee liqueur first and then adding the other liquors on top so that they settled neatly into distinct layers. "Do you want it flam--"<br><br>"Nah, I can do it myself." Hector snatched the shotglass, set the top layer ablaze with a snap of his fingers, and downed the drink, still burning. The bartender arched an eyebrow and gave him a half-smile, clearly impressed.<br><br>"Well, aren't you quite the hotshot."<br><br>"Wait 'till you see what I can do with a blue blazer." He winked at the redhead as she turned to serve another person. Hector turned his head and spotted Yoshimitsu on the other side of the bar. His first thought was to wander over and talk to him about what happened, but instead he decided to lay low and let Yoshimitsu come to him, probably after a few drinks and everyone's forgotten what happened on the boat.<br><br><br>OOC: There's gonna be a nifty little plot thang coming really soon. It's something big yo.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Yoshimitsu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">The mist was almost invisible, especially to Yoshimitsu's slightly hazy mental state. As much as he knew he had to follow the trail, he had no intention of doing it sober so he stopped for one more drink. Another neon blue cocktail that he had promptly downed. Thank God he didn't throw up from drinking too much, or he'd be well on his way. The mist trail lead out of the bars, away from the night life and into the surrounding fauna. <br><br>Despite his intoxicated state, Yoshimitsu couldn't help but notice that the mist had thickened and the air had chilled. It was interesting, just about intriguing enough for him to put his problems aside for the moment. The violin sound, the cold air... Something crunched underfoot, and he realised that the ground was covered in a thin layer of frost. It was thickening as he walked, each step making a louder crunch. Who was summoning him, and why did they think ice was the way to go about it?<br><br>The trees thickened slightly, but the light from the moon above still lit the area well enough for him to see. Up ahead, he could see a solitary figure. Back turned, covered in shadow but definitely stood there. <br><br>"So who're you, and why are you dragging me away from alcohol and dance music?" Yoshimitsu asked. It wasn't even false confidence, he just sounded bored. One hand rested on the hilt of the Bahamut Blade. A fleck of snow drifted from the branches above them, landing on Yoshimitsu's hand.<br><br>"You were the first to arrive on the island," the figure replied, a male voice, taking a step forward. Yoshimitsu's grip tightened on his sword.<br><br>The other boy was in light now. Yoshimitsu squinted a little to take in his appearence. Blue, purple and red hair, blue at the roots and fading through purple to red at the ends. A simple black mask that looped around his eyes. Fairly pale skin, though that may have been the cold. A purple jacket over a white t-shirt, faux-faded jeans and black shoes. The rapier hanging on one hip and gun hanging on the other did not go unnoticed.<br><br>"So you were watching us?" Yoshimitsu asked, subtly shifting his grip on the Bahamut Blade. This was no time for his intoxication to get the better of him. Someone had been watching them. <br><br>"Not explicitly," the stranger replied. "I happened to notice your ship anchor off shore. You're no trading ship, that much was obvious. I was curious as to your intentions. It was a simple matter of purchasing a spell to bring you to this point."<br><br>"Oh yeah?" Yoshimitsu asked, his voice full of skepticism. "Well, why not just wander over to the bar and strike up a conversation? I think you're full of shit."<br><br>With a quick swipe, Yoshimitsu drew his sword and sent a wave of blue and golden flames surging outwards. They burned up the grass and melted the snow around. Maybe Yoshimitsu was too drunk, or too slow, but the attack didn't land. The stranger had jumped out of the way, his rapier now drawn and held in defense. It looked like it was glowing slowly, a faint red. Yoshimitsu didn't much fancy finding out why it was glowing. He struck the air again, sending another wave of flames. This time, the strange sliced straight through them. The blue haired boy was faster than that, though. He followed the flames and brought his sword swinging upwards at his opponent's chest. With incredible speed, the rapier came from nowhere and opened a cut in Yoshimitsu's cheek. He jumped back.<br><br>"I didn't want to fight you," the stranger commented, lowering the rapier. His free hand went to his gun. "There's no reason to fight here. I'll buy you a drink."<br><br>"Sorry," Yoshimitsu replied, shrugging casually. "Already had a few. And I don't accept drinks from armed strangers."<br><br>"Very well," the blue and red haired boy sighed. "If this is what it takes to knock some sense into you."<br><br>The boy launched his attack first, a powerful forward thrust that would have speared the drunken fighter had he not stepped back just in time. Yoshimitsu countered by pointing his palm at the other boy's gut and summoned a flame. However, he withdrew the hand when the tip of the rapier sliced open a small cut. Boy knew how to fight. Time to get serious. Yoshimitsu hopped back, spinning a little to build up some momentum before twirling forwards and launching an overhead strike. The rapier shot up to meet it, but Yoshimitsu followed through with his free arm, an elbow to the ribcage. Using his momentary advantage, he brought his sword crashing down again.<br><br>A hand shot out and grabbed Yoshimitsu's forearm.<br><br>"That's enough, Yosh," Hector's voice came. Yoshimitsu tugged his arm free from the older boy's grip and took a few steps away from both of them.<br><br>"Thank you," the stranger said, nodding to Hector.<br><br>"Don't thank me, I was just making sure Yoshi didn't kill you," Hector replied. "Yoshi's not a killer. Not even when he's had a drink."<br><br>"I assumed not. I'm Samm, by the way," the stranger said, extending his hand to Hector. Hector shook it briefly, then turned back to Yoshimitsu.<br><br>"What's eating you?" He asked.<br><br>"That guy's been watching us," Yoshimitsu said, not turning back. "He told me that he saw us arrive and dragged me up here to find out why we're here. I don't buy it."<br><br>"Is that right?" Hector asked, looking at Samm.<br><br>"It is. I have a residence not far from here," Samm answered. "I saw your ship anchor itself and was curious. I'm not overly fond of the bars, so I used a purchased spell to bring the first person off the boat up here."<br><br>Hector nodded.<br><br>"Sounds reasonable," he commented. "Yosh, don't fly off the handle. What's up?"<br><br>Yoshimitsu didn't say anything for a minute.<br><br>"We're helping someone out, and we're headed to the South Pole," Yoshimitsu said in a monotone voice. "We stopped here because it was a convenient place to refuel and let everyone unwind. Once the ship's refueled, we're headed out again."<br><br>Yoshimitsu took a few steps, but Hector's hand closed around his bicep.<br><br>"Yoshi, whatever's bothering you, you can talk to me," Hector said. Yoshimitsu turned his head to look at Hector's worried expression. "You know that, right?"<br><br>Yoshimitsu was silent again. He shrugged his arm out of Hector's grip again, but didn't immediately move to leave. Could he admit what was wrong to Hector? That the reason he was on this massive downer was because of the older boy? He didn't want to, not yet anyway. But would it help? There was no easy answer.<br><br>"If I may interject," Samm said politely. "I'm interested in this trip you're on. Could I talk to your group leader?"<br><br>"Yeah yeah, whatever," Hector agreed dismissively. Yoshimitsu seized his chance to take a few more steps.<br><br>"I'll tell you later, Hector," he said. "But I'm feeling alcohol might be a way out of this mood, so I'm hitting the bars again."<br><br>With that, Yoshimitsu walked back down the frozen trail.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Loogs</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Hector shrugged. "Whatever works for you bro. I'll just keep drinking and hitting on that redhead broad there, so you know where to find me." He returned to the bars and signaled for another drink. "Get me a couple of sonic screwdrivers and I'll do the rest." The bartender prepared four and passed the glasses to him with a wink.<br><br>"You a Raiixian?" She whipped up her own screwdriver and leaned over the counter in front of him.<br><br>"Yeah, do you see many of those around here?" Hector polished off two of the drinks quickly and waited a while for them to kick in.<br><br>"They come in occassionally, but I used to live on the main island for a couple years. Studied pyrokinetics there. My name is Elisna. Used to be a bounty hunter, but now I'm just a humble bartender."<br><br>"A pretty good looking one too, if you ask me." They both laughed, and had more drinks. As time passed and conversations carried on, Hector was swaying and smiling foolishly, and Elisna leaned over to the other bartender and muttered something to him, to which he nodded. She stepped out of the bar and leaned in closer to Hector so that her nose was practically rubbing up against his.<br><br>"You are such a sweetie, you know that? And all that traveling and fighting stuff and sailing around the world... you're quite something."<br><br>With caution to avoid falling over, Hector stood up, brought Elisna to her feet, and placed his arms firmly around her waist. "You might just be the most gorgeous thing on this island, you know that?" They locked lips, and after a moment, he purred in his most seductive voice, "I've been on that boat awful long, you wanna maybe..." He finished the sentence in whispers, and Elisna laughed coquettishly.<br><br>"Sure, hot stuff. Why don't we finish this at my place." They walked off together in the direction of Elisna's apartment, which wasn't a very long walk after all. After accomplishing what they had gone there to do, they stepped outside onto her balcony and watched as all the people danced and reveled in the nightlife.<br><br>"I have to admit you were much better than I expected, Hector. Too bad you have to sail off again real soon."<br><br>"Yeah, I get that a lot. You were pretty fantastic yourself, I'd love to come see you again when I'm in the area. Cigarette?" He plucked one out of a metal box in his pocket, offered the box to Elisna for her to pick one out, and lit both with a flame emitted from his fingertip. He placed an arm around her thin, bare shoulders and stared off into the distance, when suddenly a bright orange spot in the sky caught his attention. It seemed to be moving closer, and flying towards them.<br><br>"What's that?"<br><br>"It looks like a bird." Hector immediately recognized it as a phoenix, beating its magnificent crimson and golden wings as it gracefully advanced closer to the balcony. In its talons was a golden envelope adorned with elaborate scarlet patterns that danced around like fire. The seal was shimmery and red and patterned with a crest. Phoenixes in mid-flight positioned at either side of a shield, with swords crossed below it and a majestic crown above it.<br><br>"Oh shit." The phoenix dropped the envelope into Hector's hands, which tremored when he noticed the detail on the envelope. His eyes widened in shock.<br><br>Elisna recognized it too. "That's--"<br><br>"The seal of the Raiixian royal family. They don't just hand these out like invitations to a pool party, and especially if they've sent it this far by phoenix."<br><br>"Wait a minute, so are you--"<br><br>"Yes, I'm descended from Aviyan Ryora himself. I'm blue-blooded and I'm the queen's son. But whatever's in this letter has to wait until morning anyway, because I don't think the crew would be thrilled with me spoiling their fun and we aren't gonna sail off again until tomorrow. So, why don't we do a little more snuggling and maybe catch some sleep together." After putting out his cigarette, Hector gently put his arm around Elisna and led her inside.<br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler4997751').toggle();if($('#spoiler4997751').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler4997751">OOC: MYSTERIOUS RAIIXIAN LETTER OOOOOOOOOO.

        <h2 class="poster">Yoshimitsu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">It was a quick descent for Yoshimitsu. Once back at the bar, the first thing he did was order another drink which he promptly downed. The second, he drank slower. Not much slower, though. With the disguised potency of the drinks, masked by the subtle blend of flavours, his trip to intoxication was a short one.<br><br>And it didn't help him much, either.<br><br>Being drunk seemed to enhance his problems, rather than reduce them. His mind couldn't hold them back, as he stood at the bar swaying slightly. It was painful to think about. Visions kept on looping around in his mind. Vincent, his eyes blacked and face twisted into a maniacal laugh. Vincent, overflowing with the power of darkness. Vincent, stood on a mountain of bloodied corpses. Worse and worse images, getting more and more graphic with nothing he could do to stop them. Vincent, holding a body on a sword. Vincent, carving someone open. It was disgustic, repulsive. Why couldn't he stop dwelling?<br><br>With no warning, he doubled over and vomited the contents of his stomach right on the dance floor. He numbly registered people's disgust, a hand pulling him up and forcing his arm over their shoulder. Being half carried, half dragged out of the open-air bar. Some distant part of his attention realised that the sea had gotten louder. Was someone dragging him to the shore? He pulled himself off whoever was moving him and vomited again, his throat burning as his body rejected the vast quantities of alcohol in his system. A hand rubbed his back, helping him finish throwing up. <br><br>"Here," Samm's voice came, an open bottle of water hovering in front of his face. Yoshimitsu grabbed it clumsily, spilling some on to the sand, and filled his mouth. He spat the water out again, trying to get rid of the foul taste in his mouth, then drank the water greedily. The need to rehydrate himself overruled anything else right now. Samm dragged him another few meters, and placed him on the sand gently.<br><br>"How're you feeling?" Samm asked gently. <br><br>"Terrible," Yoshimitsu mumbled. He finally opened his eyes, his head still groggy and unclear.<br><br>"Here, try this," Samm offered, pulling a small tablet from his pocket. Yoshimitsu didn't even question it, he took the tablet and swallowed it whole. Samm produced another bottle of water from nowhere, and Yoshimitsu accepted it. He drank it slowly this time, giving his body time to adjust to the sudden flow of water.<br><br>It took about five minutes, but Yoshimitsu's head started to clear up. <br><br>"Miracle cure," Samm explained. "A synthesis of magical and chemical properties that restores the body to a functioning, healthy state."<br><br>"Where'd you pick up something like that?" Yoshimitsu asked.<br><br>"You're on an island where the trade of magical items is common," Samm answered, shrugging. "You pick up a few things, and keep whatever comes in handy."<br><br>"Yeah I guess," Yoshimitsu said, standing up. He took a few steps forward, watching the boat on the waves. "Sorry. About earlier, I mean. I'm not usually that stabby."<br><br>"I guessed as much. From your interaction with your friend, I assume you have plenty on your mind," Samm replied in a nonchalant voice. "I wont pry. I just hope you don't think I have any malicious intent."<br><br>"No, sorry, I was being stupid," Yoshimitsu admitted. He certainly did sound sorry. "I just have some issues going on and thought getting drunk would help it."<br><br>"Did it?"<br><br>"I feel like I lost some weight, if that counts," Yoshimitsu admitted, cracking a small smile. He extended his hand to the other boy. "Let's start over. I'm Yoshimitsu."<br><br>"Samm. A pleasure," Samm replied, shaking Yoshimitsu's hand.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">I Ketut Topan stepped onto the docks, and turned back to face his ship. Despite his volatile load of Powers, it was in pretty much flawless condition. One of the railings was slightly scraped, most likely due to all the comings and goings not bothering with the proper route.<br><br>Powers... He sighed, and shook his head slightly. With all he'd been through in life, taxiing a bunch of superhuman hoodlums was nowhere near where he'd have guessed to have ended up.<br><br>“Going ashore, eh?” A gruff voice caught his attention. The hairy one was hanging down from the canopy, much like a macaque. Though a macaque was less hirsute, and most likely better mannered as well. He whirled about, an awkward motion, and slid down the side of the ship. He landed on the lower deck roughly, and sauntered to his feet.<br><br>“Yes, I am going ashore,” I Ketut said, not bothering to look the man in the eye. He was repugnant anyways, and not worth the effort it would take to meet his pompous gaze.<br><br>“Same here,” The bearded man planted a boot on the railing, and kicked off. In a single movement, he cleared the distance between the boat and the dock. Despite his unseemly ways, the man was quite capable when it came to maneuvering around. Topan knew the type very well.<br><br>“Good news for you, Cap'n, Meeks says he's stayin' on board, so you don't need to worry about anybody makin' off with your ship, ” The man didn't say anything more, and lurched past him into town. Despite having been in his care for almost a day, not a single one of the passengers had yet bothered asking I Ketut if he actually had a name. He hadn't bothered any of them over it yet, for it seemed like such would make him appear ungracious, but it was beginning to wear away at his last nerves. He really should have been in expectation of such behavior though, as after all, they were from the archipelago.<br><br>He glanced back one last time, and shook his head slightly. A faint sigh of disgust escaped his lips.<br><br>And with no more ceremony, I Ketut Topan turned away. He began walking along the familiar dock, to the smells and sights of a place that was almost like a second home.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Testbug</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">The blue-haired man said something incredibly non-committal and fled the bar, leaving his empty glass at the counter.  Another delicious strike out.  Taylor looked back down at his bourbon, and sucked down another drink.  Delightful luck with men lately.  Maybe all those straight men weren't entirely wrong for leaving the homosexual dating crap for some nice women-love.  Whatever reasons they had, they weren't Taylor's business.  Gah.  Men.  Taylor downed the rest of his bourbon, and hoarsely shouted to the bartender.<br><br>"Another!"  It wasn't like him to be rude, but he needed another.  A bourbon slid down the table, slapping against the warm flesh of Taylor's hand.  He placed the glass to his lips, and slammed it quickly.  He coughed and sputtered a little, wiping his lips on his sleeve.  After letting the second drink settle, the teen stood up, and looked at the bartender.<br><br>"Start up a tab for me,"  Taylor instructed with a slight slur, shuffling his way towards the dance floor.  "I'll be buying some more."  The bartender nodded and flashed a thumbs-up before returning to work.  Taylor scuttled out onto the floor and took to supporting the wall.  He guessed he could look and not touch.  For now.<br><br>Before long, the same blue-haired man that had given him the cold shoulder shambled into the bar.  Taylor's foggy brain strung together a few coherent emotion strands, and forced Taylor over to the teen.<br><br>"Hey,"  Taylor began, but the teen suddenly doubled over, vomiting directly onto where Taylor was standing.  The mostly blue substance struck directly on his boots, and Taylor's mind almost instantly cleared for a moment.  <br><br>Taylor sighed irritatedly, and reached down into his pockets. He retrieved an oblong stone, no larger than a golf ball, and stuck it into the metal recess of his left hand.  The blue stone suddenly surged with life, the center flashing a bright red.  Taylor kneeled down as his fingers reached down looking to touch his soiled shoes, but stopped just inches above the surface.  A bright blue, shimmering aura encompassed the area above his shoes, and then lifted and expanded, forming a large, shoe-shaped barrier of blue magic in the air.  Taylor removed his feet from where they'd been, and the magic faded out of existence.  The puke dropped to the floor, and Taylor turned to face the man that had been nothing but rude to him that night.  He couldn't see the man in the dance club, so he looked around the room.<br><br>Taylor headed past the bar, dropping a twenty on his way out.  He spied the man he was looking for down a ways, towards the shore.  Damn.  That teen moved fast!  Taylor staggered along, clutching beams of wood and the odd tiki torch as he stumbled his way down the sands.  His feet stole him away to a place behind the bar, and then spun around on their heels like the feet of toy soldiers.  Taylor couldn't help but feel he wasn't leading his own feet, and stopped in his tracks.<br><br>"Carby,"  He thought pointedly.<br><br>"Yes?"  A silky voice filtered in through his mind, the voice of the summon beast inhabiting the stone in his left hand.<br><br>"Why are you doing this?"  Taylor asked in thought.<br><br>"Because you shouldn't do this."<br><br>"And why the fuck not?"<br><br>"You're drunk.  And a bit angry."<br><br>"I am not angry you...  you glorified Japanese... myth-fox!"<br><br>"You can't even properly insult me."<br><br>"Shut up!  I can do this!"  Taylor shambled forth a few steps, but began to fall as his knees bucked.<br><br>"Proof that you can't."<br><br>"You're the one doing this to me!"  Taylor reached down to his left hand furiously, inching his fingernails into the metal resting place of the stone.<br><br>"Taylor, don't-"  Her voice was cut short by Taylor ripping the stone out of his hand, the sound violently smothered by the summoner's action.<br><br>"That'll teach <i>her</i>,"  Taylor muttered as he shoved the object back in his pocket.  He forced his way down the sands, quickly falling into earshot of the man and his new friend.<br><br>"...Yoshimitsu,"  The blue-haired teen said as he shook the red-haired man's hand.<br><br>"Samm (or was it Sam?)," He said.  "A pleasure."<br><br>"Taylor,"  The brown-haired newcomer said angrily, focusing on the sword-wielding, ill-mannered, oh-so-mysterious teen.  "The man you refused to talk to and then <i>barfed</i> on.  A pleasure, no doubt."  Taylor smirked and cocked his head.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">I Ketut brought the beedi to his lips, and inhaled deeply. He had run short on his supply of them before reaching the Archipelago, so replenishing them here was a most fortunate occasion. The usual man, a bony Indian that went by the sole name of Gandharaj, had cut him a deal, and he now slung a burlap bag full of packets over his shoulder.<br><br>That was one of the two major stops. He wouldn’t be able to tolerate the intolerable Powers if he didn’t have something serviceable to smoke. Now, he might be able to bear the burden of their childish antics for the necessary period of time. If not… Well, he had one more stop to make. He ducked a dangling lightbulb, the heat from it prickling his brow. With a practiced step, he parted from the crowd and turned down an alleyway between two of the more decrepit shacks. He stepped over a broken bag of garbage, fruit rinds and halfway broken beerbottles strewing the ground of the alleyway. Fortunately, none of the passed out sailors had chosen this location for shelter, and his pathway was otherwise unobstructed. He turned a corner, and came upon a T in the path. Both ends were the walls of buildings, corrugated steel panels that were light enough to transport but sturdy enough to survive the rigors of business.<br><br>I Ketut turned left, the thin wisp of smoke trailing over his shoulder. He took three large paces, and found himself staring at the unremarkable panel. He ran his finger along the metal, a loud zipping noise accompanying the motion. He pulled his hand away, and then knocked three times on the wall. Turning on his heel, he looked away from the waved siding with a studious attention to his indifference.<br><br>CHK-SHTUK<br><br>The noise was his signal. He looked over his shoulder, meeting the gaze of young man with glimmering silver stripes decorating his otherwise ordinarily black hair.  It was swept back in a ponytail, dangling over an embroidered white dress shirt.<br><br>The man simply gestured, and I Ketut complied. He stepped quickly through the concealed doorway, the man almost slamming the panel back into place behind him.<br><br>“Welcome back to The Midden. Glad t’ have you t’day.”<br><br>“Good to see you again, Lepida.”<br><br>“Same here, man.”<br><br>The room they had entered was the color of rust. Such things happened when you had an empty shack made out of whatever scrap metal you could scavenge up. However, I Ketut had been here on several occasions. He knew what the true nature of the building was, and its apparently impoverished appearance was certainly not enough to put him off. A single wisp of smoke danced in the sickly yellow light of another bare bulb.<br><br>“So, picking up some <i>supplies</i>, hey?” The youth pulled the sleeve of his shirt up, and revealed a tattoo on his bronzed skin. It was an incomplete circle, lapsing into a heavy dark “X” in the middle. The ink seemed almost to push up under his skin, giving it an odd sheen.<br><br>He traced the design with his fingertip, only breaking away once before crossing the X. Without lifting his finger, he spoke.<br><br>“Ulmer.”<br><br>Instantly, dozens of lights flickered from the walls, drowning out the sickly illumination that the yellowed bulb above them offered. The lights took the shapes of a variety of items in sillouettes, bullets, swords, shirts, indeterminate spheres, talismans, and many others in less overt quantities.<br><br>“Do you have anything that is…” I Ketut strained to remember the codewords for the item he was looking for. They only allowed people to purchase items here if the were capable of using the appropriate terminology, told to them once they were trusted enough. As far as he understood, it was a measure to avoid shapeshifters running up other people’s tabs or otherwise getting into mischief.<br><br>“Good for breaking windows?” I Ketut could not help but smirk. What a way to sell short the devastation a device could bring!<br><br>“Sure thing. Gimme a moment,” Lepida put his hand on one of the circles, pressing his palm flat. Slowly, he drew back, bringing a drawer out of a wall far too thin to conceal it. Dozens of clear spheres, looking almost like marbles, were nestled in it.<br><br>“Extra special, these ‘n’s are. Take a look,” The youth drew one from the compartment, and tossed it to the captain from between his fingers. It was caught effortlessly, I Ketut’s reflexes every bit as sharp as they were in his youth.<br><br>He brought it up to his eye, and looked closely at it. There were flecks of black glass in the center of the ball, none bigger than a flea. Lepida gently took it from him, the motion businesslike enough to let him know wasn’t supposed to be pawing anything he wouldn’t purchase.<br><br>“Some of my pals hit a find down south, ‘bout four-six days away. ‘S ‘n island, but it just showed up. Just outta nowhere, popped up from the ocean,” The salesman smiled a lopsided grin, “And man, you should see what the sand from that place can do. It’s crazy.”<br><br>“I suppose that I would like to hear more about this, provided that it’s…” Topan stopped once more, and took another pull on his beedi. He’d never had to use the phrase here before.<br><br>“A decent enough level.”<br><br>“Oh, levels? You’re kidding me. This isn’t the stuff you get into, Tut,” One of the stripes in Lepida’s hair caught the gleam from the lights in the room.<br><br>“I know!” I Ketut didn’t know if he should be proud of himself or concerned. Lepida was right. The situation with the Powers was most certainly not his typical business plan, but there was the potential for profits to be had. He wiped his hand against his pants. Oddly enough, the fingers that had been holding the marble were feeling somewhat numb.<br><br>“But that’s where fate ended up putting me. On a boat full of the kind.”<br><br>“Ah, so you stepped in it and ya need something to wipe ya off. Gotcha,” Lepida turned to wall, and began pulling drawer after drawer open.<br><br>With thirty compartments full of assorted weaponry pulled open behind him, he extended his hands to either side, fingers splayed.<br><br>“I think we’ve got something for you.”<br>--------<br>I Ketut Topan stepped back onto his boat, not bothering to look about for the passengers. People that were on the lookout for enemies were suspicious. People that couldn’t be bothered with others merely had important business to attend to.<br><br>He shouldered past the woman with wings, and pushed his way into the cabin. His burlap bag didn’t really weigh all that much more than it did before he stopped at The Midden. His pockets did. His trip ashore had probably cost him what he normally made in five months, and some of the items he’d had to promise to pay for at a later date.<br><br>However, he was still feeling much better than he had that afternoon. He had his cigarettes, and he had his safety.<br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler7459759').toggle();if($('#spoiler7459759').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler7459759">OOC: Ugh, lost the voice I hit better last post.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Thin, brilliant beams of light sneaked in through the blinders in Elisna's bedroom, dancing around Hector's closed eyes announcing that morning had come. The ornate envelope he had received the previous night rested on her nightstand ominously, bursting at the seams with vital information. Hector groggily opened his eyes and yawned, one arm draped gently over Elisna's torso which raised and lowered with every deep breath she took. He pulled her in closer to kiss her good morning, but suddenly his vision went reeling and something in his stomach fought violently to escape.<br><br>Elisna instead woke up to the sound of Hector retching in her bathroom.<br><br>"I keep a box of Alka-Seltzer tablets and some paper cups in the medicine cabinet," she said, with a snicker and a smile. He called out a thanks before vomiting again. Elisna gritted her teeth and sucked in. "Eeeesh, that's one of the worst hangovers I've ever had the misfortune to hear." She yawned, hoisted herself out of bed, and walked to the kitchen where she began preparing breakfast.<br><br>Elisna, wearing only a violet camisole and matching panties, was neatly arranging pancakes, eggs, and breakfast sausages on plates when Hector crept up behind her and embraced her. He breathed in her intoxicating scent, buried his face in her long red hair, and pressed himself close to her body. Before he could lock lips with her though, Elisna shoved him away.<br><br>"Ewww gross, you just puked." She thrust a plate into his hands, and carried her own to her small dining table. Pouring syrup on her pancakes, she asked, "Where are you off to now, anyway?"<br><br>"Papua New Guinea, and from there we go to Antarctica."<br><br>"That's quite a journey, hotshot, mind if I ask why?"<br><br>"I'm tagging along with a friend of mine who's on a mission, but it looks like I might have to cut this trip short and attend to whatever business is in that letter." Hector, knowing he was due back on the boat very soon, wolfed down his food as quickly as possible, chasing it down with a glass of orange juice.<br><br>"Oh hey, speaking of which, don't forget this." Elisna handed him the aforementioned letter which he had left in her room. She chewed and swallowed a mouthful of food before speaking again. "Listen, if you're ever in a tough spot and need a drink or something, or a place to stay or lie low or something, you're always welcome to stay here. I enjoyed the time I spent with you, I really did."<br><br>"Me too, girl, me too. I'll come see you again sometime, promise." He kissed her one more time before he picked up the letter, tucked it away in one of his coat pockets, and exited her apartment.<br><br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler8604913').toggle();if($('#spoiler8604913').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler8604913">OOC: Just assume he's back on the boat now, everyone.</div></div></div>

No need to prepare for a fight any more, if the stranger was being reasonable. A fight was probably the last thing he needed right now, having already had one within the last hour. "And I think I've run out of time here."<br><br>"Yoshimitsu, might I enquire as to your ultimate destination?" Samm asked, his voice quite curious. Yoshimitsu turned his head to the other boy, trying to gauge what his reaction might be.<br><br>"A friend of mine needs a new weapon, so we're off to the south pole," Yoshimitsu replied, choosing his words carefully. It might not be a good idea to immediately reveal that he was helping the summoners. There was a lot of hate out there.<br><br>"The weapon needs to be acquired there?" Samm asked. Yoshimitsu fidgeted uncomfortably. The boy was quite good at picking up on details, it seemed. Especially details by omission.<br><br>"Well, yeah, the summoners have all sorts of nifty gear," Yoshimitsu answered. If he could evade the question regarding who he was helping, then maybe he could avoid another brawl. <br><br>"I see... Would it be acceptable for me to accompany you?" Samm asked politely. "The study of other cultures fascinates me."<br><br>"Oh," Yoshimitsu said, surprised. "I... I guess so? The more the merrier, sure. But we've really gotta jet, I get the feeling the boat wants to leave soon."<br><br>"Of course."<br><br>Yoshimitsu turned to the water, his right hand glowing with a pulsating blue colour. With a flick of his wrist, the glow ceased but a semi-corporeal figure began to fade into view. A huge figure, two giant wings, a long tail and covered in deep blue scales. Bahamut's form finally took a physical presense, wings beating lightly to keep him airbourne. No words needed to be said. Yoshimitsu jumped in to the dragon's hand and up to his shoulder.<br><br>"You coming?" Yoshimitsu asked, as Bahamut placed his tail on the beach. Samm nodded, taking the appearence of the dragon in his stride, and carefully walked up the tail up to the other shoulder. The boys both braced themselves for take off, as Bahamut beat his wings powerfully. The trip back to the boat was unsurprisingly short. Bahamut's size and speed made the flight barely a minute long. Both boys jumped down on to the boat, and the great dragon vanished with a nod to Yoshimitsu.<br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler9086451').toggle();if($('#spoiler9086451').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler9086451">Bleh.

He heard the dull roar of the engine starting, and the boat shuddered into motion again. Obviously the captain had returned while the boy wasn't paying attention.<br><br>"Go on, ask away.

"We were good friends once upon a time. The best friends two people could be. If you saw one of us, it was pretty much certain the other wouldn't be too far behind. The old days."<br><br>"You're not that old yourself," Samm commented.<br><br>"Nah, you're right. It just feels like a long time ago," Yoshimitsu said, turning to face the boat and leaning against the railings. He glanced over everyone who was present. So many faces. "We had out ups and downs, though. My old enemy, Vincent. Some stuff happened, but me and Vincent turned into friends instead. Hector was left in the dust."<br><br>"That doesn't sound nice for him," Samm said fairly.<br><br>"No, I didn't mean it... I mean, I didn't deliberately distance myself," Yoshimitsu explained quickly. "It just happened. Thing is, this Hector in font of me... He's not the same Hector I used to know. The Hector I used to know wasn't this womanizing creep."<br><br>"I see..."<br><br>At that moment, Hector decided to resurface looking slightly more presentable. Their eyes locked for a second.<br><br>"Better make yourself scarce. There's no way this is gonna end well," Yoshimitsu warned. Samm nodded, and walked away.

If he had to guess, the weight behind those steps were because Hector's head was hung and his shoulders slumped. He knew it was Hector. It wouldn't be anyone else. Hector stood for a moment, next to him at the front of the boat. It felt awkward. Stood side by side with a person who used to be his best friend. Yoshimitsu struggled for words, but was saved the necessity of speaking when Hector chose to.<br><br>"It's been a while since... since we've really talked... Hasn't it?"<br><br>Yoshimitsu didn't respond immediately. What could he say? That was entirely true. He caught the meaning, though. The meaning behind those words. Hector realised something was wrong, but he couldn't tell what or why. <br><br>"Yeah. It's like I said, we went our different ways," Yoshimitsu replied calmly. What would Hector say next?

Everything surrounding them. All the emotion just put into one sentence, and Yoshimitsu picked up on everything. Hector was sad. Hector was regretting not keeping in touch. Hector was being the fucking hero he wasn't meant to be, the tragic hero who made all of the mistakes. He had always been infalliable. Reckless, but sure of himself. Always saw the right way forward, and the best way even if it was the stupidest.<br><br>All it took was those words.<br><br>"Yoshi, there's a lot we haven't talked about concerning the past. I'm going to let you have the first word here." <br><br>And Yoshimitsu snapped.<br><br>He grabbed the front of Hector's shirt, his hand in his former friend's face, with a ghostly silver glow covering it. There was pure aggression in his face, anger and hate and sadness and envy all thrown in there trying to fight for dominance. Hector's eyes kept on darting between Yoshimitsu's face and his hand, but he made no move to free himself.<br><br>"Hector fucking Cruz," Yoshimitsu breathed, his voice gruff and low. "You used to be amazing. You used to be beautiful. You used to be one of the few sources of pure Light on this planet, and you fucking ruined it. You have a family and people who love you, you have the best intentions that people kill for, you shit fucking gold bricks and you sit and you mope and cry and hurt the people who love you because of it."<br><br>Yoshimitsu raised his spare hand and curled it into a fist, visibly shaking as he let out his anger.

"I know she doesn't deserve it. I know she deserves better. But do you blame a guy for hitting rock bottom when all his friends decide he's too degenerate to be worth a damn?"<br><br>Then, anger. Hector's gaze sharpened into a steely glare, nostrils flaring. "It's not like you're some saint yourself. What exactly have you been up to that you won't share with me or anyone? Why are you so shady all of a sudden? Who <i>are</i> you?"</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"I've never been a saint, Hector," Yoshimitsu shot back, folding his arms in a defiant expression. "When have I ever saved lives without taking the riskiest course of action, the one that could kill just as many people? Just because I wont pull the trigger myself doesn't make me some sort of paladin and you know that."<br><br>Yoshimitsu let out an angry sigh, unfolding his arms and resting one hand on the hilt of his Bahamut blade. <br><br>"You're asking me who I am?" He repeated, though he didn't need the clarification. "I'm exactly who you see in front of you. I'm the genetically engineered bio-weapon from another dimension who went renegade because he has a heart, and I'm the broken teenager who's spent the past year trying to rectify his own mistakes. I'm Yoshimitsu, and who the fuck are you, Hector?"</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Miko took another bite out of the generous pineapple wedge he’d carved himself. The noontime sun was bouncing off the waves, making the surface look like hammered steel. An army of sun cats raced around his room, crisscrossing and leaping from surface to surface.<br><br>Rivulets of juice ran down his hand, leaving trails that’d inevitably become annoyingly sticky. He savored a  pulpy morsel of the fruit, masticating it for a few good chews. This treat, the sweetness with just a faint trace of something like spiciness… The sun on his face, full of blinding warmth… Those were pleasures that the Summoners down south didn’t have. Things that they really COULDN’T have at the present time.<br><br>If they’d thought ahead, been humble instead of imperious, peaceful instead of expansionist… The empire could’ve dissolved itself, peacefully immigrating into any nation they so chose. Russia for those that’d miss the old lifestyle, America for those that wanted to jump into the modernized world. The archipelago, for those that still wanted to retain their powers without having to hide them away. The world was a place massive beyond any mortal comprehension, of such breadth and depth that there was a perfect spot for anybody willing to seek it.<br><br>In retrospect, the doctrines (or maybe, better said as dogmas) that he’d grown up with were nothing but pure and utter bullshit. Pride was a blind fool, leading all that worshiped at its alter along the avenue that ran from self glorification straight down to inevitable self destruction. By considering themselves as superior to the rest of the world, worthy not to be peers or servants, but only rulers, they’d consigned themselves to being the rulers of naught but an icy deathtrap.<br><br>Miko couldn’t bring himself to entirely despise the feeling of pride though. It drove him onwards, gave him more strength than he had the right to as a fragile human being. He’d trained for every spell in his repertoire, fought for every Summon he commanded. It wasn’t the blind luck that had earned so many others their powers, or some gift at the behest of some other party. He’d earned the right, the competence, that allowed him to go toe to toe with beings that the normal people regarded as deities.<br><br>He didn’t have much pride in the Summoners, but his heart swelled to the bursting point with his pride <i>as</i> a Summoner. Was it really hubris for him to-<br><br>There was a quiet rap at the door, yanking him out of his reverie. Mia, judging by the voice.<br><br>“One moment…” Miko threw the rind of the pineapple into a small plastic trashcan, the receptacle teetering before settling down again. He strode to the door purposefully, his shoulder throbbing slightly with each step. Magical healing could speed things along, but it still could miss little, nagging things here and there.<br><br>He undid the latch, and opened the door wide with a sudden yank. Mia’s face betrayed momentary surprise. <i>Probably shouldn’t make any sudden movements around the poor girl…</i><br><br>“So, what’s it you need to talk about?”<br>--------<br>“Dad says that there’s a boat coming along.”<br><br>“And this is different from the others <i>how</i>?”<br><br>“Yes, if he told you about it, it obviously is of some importance.”<br><br>“From what he said, I think there’s another sister for us on board.”<br><br>“So, it’s another delivery, then. It’d be nice if this one doesn’t die as quickly as the last one did.”<br><br>“No duh.”<br><br>“It’s not… quite a delivery. Dad says that there’s people defending this one.”<br><br>“So… more practice for us, then?”<br><br>“Against real live people?”<br><br>“Far as I can tell. He didn’t really brief me anything more than what I’ve already told you… And that I should start thinking up a plan for bringing our new sister home.”<br><br>“How many of us are going? Am I going?”<br><br>“He said that you and Parsimony have to stay here. The other three are all free to go, though.”<br><br>“Have you told them yet?”<br><br>“You can’t really tell Eltas, stupid.”<br><br>“I know that. And mind your language, Olivia.”<br><br>“I’m on my way to tell them right now. I haven’t heard any explosions for a good half hour, so now <i>probably</i> is the best chance I’ll get.”<br><br>“Unless he’s blown himself up for good. That’d work too!”<br><br>“Olivia…”<br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler5187334').toggle();if($('#spoiler5187334').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler5187334">OOC: Sorry to diverge from the rest of thread a bit, but things without blue hair need love too!</div></div></div>
