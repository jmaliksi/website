        <div class="content"><div class="message"><i>Undisclosed location, USA</i><br><br>“Tell me how your investigation went, Ka’ina.”<br><br>The reigning Queen of Raiixia sat across from her most trusted royal advisor with her elegantly bejeweled hands folded in front of her.  Between them, on top of the dining table, was a basket of fresh fruit they were sharing. Marimai reached for a particularly inviting strawberry and nibbled the end off of it, but frowned and puckered her mouth upon the unexpected tartness of the fruit.<br><br>“The investigation, uh… It’s not good.” Ka’inamei wore a somber expression as she tried to figure out the best way to break the news to her. “Well, half of it, anyway. The other half isn’t very rosy either, but—“<br><br>“Please just tell me what you found, Ka’ina. It’s alright.”<br><br>“Well, um…” Ka’inamei paused for her own sake this time, to brace herself emotionally. “We looked into all the records, and we managed to track down your sons’ adoptive parents.”<br><br>Marimai’s face brightened noticeably. “Ka’ina, that’s truly incredible. I must commend you. There are people who couldn’t do in their lifetimes what you managed to do in a paltry two months. Do go on.”<br><br>Ka’inamei presented the first of two dossiers to the queen. “One of your sons was adopted by a couple named Mordechai and Rivkah Galetsky, living in Woodridge, New York.” She opened the manila folder and handed Marimai the birth certificate of one Dimitri Eliezer Galetsky.<br><br>“What a nice name.” Marimai pored over the rest of the dossier. She cooed over the photographs and glimpsed into the life of Dimitri, a reserved young boy, on his family’s farm, attending Shabbat services at the synagogue, and playing with the family dog. <i>”Dimitri was a nice boy, always mindful of anyone in need. He was very bright and loved to study Torah with his grandfather and his family every week. His father taught him how to carve wood…”</i> As Marimai read through the Galetsky’s accounts of their son, a troubling thought began to surface in her mind.<br><br>“These accounts… They’re all in the past tense…” Marimai leafed through the rest of the dossier until she froze, a death certificate in her hands.<br><br>“Yes, that’s because… Dimitri passed away in 2003. A tragic, unfortunate accident while he was helping his parents on the farm.” Ka’inamei became silent. Marimai let the document fall from her grasp, biting her lip and holding back tears. She was about to reach out for Ka’inamei’s hand when she stopped herself, regaining her regal composure.<br><br>“Forgive me.” Marimai folded her hands in front of her again and looked back up at her lifelong confidant. “Please continue with your report.”</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Ka’inamei presented the second dossier. “Your other child, Hector Esteban Cruz-Mendieta, was adopted by Xiomara Mendieta and Felix Alberto Cruz in Paterson, New Jersey.” Marimai opened the folder and examined its contents: photocopies of various identification documents, medical documents, photographs, and personal accounts from various sources.<br><br>“My, they’re such different boys, aren’t they?” Marimai remarked as she admired the photos one by one and compared them to the photos in Dimitri’s file. This boy appeared to be much more extroverted: several snapshots captured him playing with his group of friends. “<i>Hector had energy to spare. He always had a smile that could light up a room, and he was very adventurous. A little rebellious at times, and prone to troublemaking, but he always meant well…</i>”<br><br>The next set of items in the dossier gave her pause. “A missing child report?”<br><br>Ka’inamei sighed heavily. “His parents were sad to inform me that he disappeared about nine years ago.” Her heart sank upon watching Marimai’s crestfallen reaction to learning about her children’s untimely fates. “In fact, the reason they were so forthcoming with information on him is because they were excited about the prospect of anyone having an interest in their missing child. It seems that the case went cold years ago, and they’d long given up on ever seeing Hector again.”<br><br>Marimai, once again on the verge of tears, laid out every single photograph in front of her on the table. She gazed forlornly at the only evidence she possessed of her sons’ existence, attempting to reconstruct an alternate future in her mind; she cradled her infant sons, and watched as they took their first steps. Here on the table lay her children, saying their first words not in Raiixian but in English, eating American foods nothing like the sumptuous meals served to her by the palace’s chefs, never knowing the thousands of sleepless nights’ worth of their mother’s fathomless yearning.<br><br>She was finally reeled back into reality by Ka’inamei saying something to her. “I’m not quite finished with my report, Your Highness.”<br><br>“You’re not?” Marimai appeared confused.<br><br>“No, I’ve still got a lot of work left to do.” Her countenance conveyed an air of determination. “The authorities may have given up, but I’m just getting started. I’m going to assemble an investigation team to solve the case of Hector’s disappearance.” Ka’inamei took a deep breath. “I can’t say I’m not afraid of what I’m going to find, but his parents deserve the closure. I have to do this. For Felix and Xiomara’s sake… and for yours. As well as Hector’s, whether he’s dead or alive.”<br><br>“Ka’ina, I’m not expecting you to go above and beyond like this—“<br><br>“Forgive me for interrupting, my queen, but whether you expect me to or not, I have a sworn duty to serve the royal family at all costs. The Amikanas have pledged their fealty to the Raiixian monarch for centuries, and I will do so until the very hour of my death.”<br><br>Marimai sobbed, unable to restrain tears any longer. Trembling, she took Ka’inamei’s hand into her own and placed a kiss on the back of it. “I owe you far more gratitude than I could possibly ever give you. Thank you, Ka’inamei.”<br><br>“It is, as always, my pleasure, Your Majesty.” Ka’inamei bowed deeply in reverence. She then gathered the documents and placed them back in their respective dossiers. “Actually, I believe I already have my first lead. While I was collecting information from his parents, I heard an interesting story from the locals.”<br><br>“Around the same time he went missing, accounts surfaced of people who claim to have witnessed a young man on fire jump into the river and swept away, never to be seen again.”</div></div>
