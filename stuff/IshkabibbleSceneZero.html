        <h2 class="poster">Beelzebibble</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message"><i>OOC: What? No kidding. Ishkabibble’s starting early? Well, kind of. Things won’t really get going until after the Lugiasian Awards, but the story’s beginning here. Call this a prologue if you like.<br><br>As with all the Ish topics, this one is <font color="red"><b>strictly invitational</b></font>. In this case it’s only me and Qzumaki who’ll be participating. However, Lee’s presence will be felt as well: the Blaise-Alpha dialogue at the beginning results from collaboration with him, naturally. There’ll be a couple more cutscenes that he helped with later in the story; you’ll know his contributions when you see them.<br><br>Guys. You don’t even know how excited I am. Once we finish this whole RP, I can die happy.</i><br><br><br><br><i>Saturday the 14th<br>3:39 pm</i><br><br>This was the time Alpha noted on the clock that hung from the far wall. He checked it against his own watch and was momentarily taken aback: The time indicated there was exactly the same, down to the second. He was certain the two timepieces had been off by a couple of minutes when he had first come to work in this laboratory. <br><br>A explanation came to mind. The resident of this space must have synchronized Alpha’s watch to her clock sometime when he hadn’t been wearing it. Yes, that was quite easy to believe.<br><br>The room was two stories tall, and windowless, with a ceiling made out of wood of all things. In fact, much of the room’s composition was wooden: the trim bookshelves lining the walls, the broad worktable and the desk beyond it, and the spiral staircase leading up to the balcony and from there out into the hallways of the Parmigianino Institute. Alpha had been surprised this laboratory’s owner didn’t subscribe to more of a steel-and-concrete school of architecture. Possibly there was something about the old-fashioned furnishings that appealed to her.<br><br>In any case, while the design of the room might have been antique, the scientific equipment and fixtures were not. The tubes, beakers and flasks covering the worktable testified well enough to this. One, for instance, contained a purplish liquid which was apparently lighter than air, judging from the way it settled neatly at the top of its container.<br><br>“I am subscribing to the assumption that you are fully prepared to assist my laboratory duties at the present moment?” Blaise's voice came from behind Alpha, jolting him out of his reverie. Despite otherwise dressed in closely fitting dark clothes, she still wore her labcoat. Alpha, searching his collective memory banks, couldn't seem to recall one occasion that he had seen her without it.<br><br>“We will be synthesizing several magical catalysts and enhancing compounds today. Expedience is neccessary due to the volatile behavior of several of the reactants, thus requiring this dedication of manpower to the task.” Despite facing Alpha, Blaise hadn’t tried to make eye contact. In fact, it seemed almost as if she was looking straight through him.<br><br>Alpha put forth one token effort to meet her eye before giving up and looking down at the table. Eye contact with Blaise would have been a predictable thing anyway. She seemed to have only one facial expression on reserve for him: pursed lips and eyebrows raised slightly enough to suggest polite incredulity. If he weren't able to consult memories of her from the original Terrian, he would have believed this was the only look she could manage.<br><br>“What will I do?” he asked, leaving the roundabout speech as always to his antecedent.<br><br>“You will stop obstructing my path, for one.” Blaise jerked her head slightly, awkwardly trying to indicate the table directly ahead of her. Alpha muttered an apology and stepped out of her way as quickly as he could manage.<br><br>“As for the actual undertaking that we have before us, you shall stand by with a container of halting agent, and add it to the vessels after I finish engaging the reaction. As stated prior, these reactions are extremely volatile. If we do not stop them at the appropriate point in their progress, they will rapidly become uncontrollable and may self-terminate.” Blaise extended a foot under the table to slide a wheeled stool out from underneath. There was still only one in the room, despite the fact that Alpha had been working in the lab for quite some time now.<br><br>The young man picked up the sealed vial that Blaise indicated, and stood by the table. The original Terrian might have rested a hand nonchalantly on the wooden surface, but the original Terrian was not accustomed to working in Blaise Euler's laboratory. As it was, Alpha stood quite upright.<br><br>“Tell me when.”<br><br>“Remember. Expedience and precision. Elsewise, this could prove to be utterly catastrophic. I will begin the reaction at the end of this twenty count… Twenty…” Blaise slid a metal rack of test tubes along the table with a clatter, and the glass tinkled. Each one contained a swirling mixture of luminous blues and metallic greens, marbling and sloshing back and forth with the movement. Alpha didn’t know why she had started with a twenty count, but it was inevitable that if he asked her, she’d drone on and on in inscrutable technobabble until he wanted to be struck deaf.<br><br>“Seven…” Blaise’s hand darted out, a sharp, serpentine movement. She unstoppered one of the test tubes, and drew it from the rack. The mixture began to sizzle, and glowing white sparks shot off of the surface and hit the glass. Wherever they landed, they left tiny silver flecks, which soon flaked away and tumbled back into the stew below.<br><br>“Three…” Blaise grabbed the flask of levitating fluid from the table, using her thumb to pop it open as she inverted it. The fluid ran to what would be the “bottom” of a normal bottle.<br><br>“Two…” The woman slowly tilted the bottle sideways, as if to pour it into the air. A single droplet emerged, and tumbled towards the ceiling. Blaise quickly turned the container upside down again, retaining the rest of the liquid.<br><br>“One!” Blaise’s hand with the test tube rocketed forward. She flipped it in midair, catching the eggplant-colored bead at the same time that the roiling fluid began to spill out. She turned the tube again with a practiced flick of her wrist to catch the result as it dropped.<br><br>The fluid had turned into a miniature storm, sloshing more violently than it had any right to do even with Blaise’s motions. Big green sparks began shooting from the surface, one chipping the inside of the tube where it struck. “Now would be a good time, duplicate.” Blaise threw her hand out to the side, waiting expectantly for her assistant to dole out a measure of the solution.<br><br>“Understood.” Alpha was prepared to show his mettle by approaching the murderously seething solution and reaching the vial out to it without fear. This would be a fine image once he opened the vial.<br><br>He hesitated. The stopper didn't simply pop out. He tried twisting it one way. And then the other. He'd been trying to keep his eyes on the table so as not to give away his confusion, but he was finally forced to raise the vial up to scrutiny. His hands felt huge and clumsy. He couldn't open it.<br><br>“Um...!”<br><br>“You imbecile!” Blaise shouted, and flung the test tube aside. As it arced through the air, not yet spilling so much as a droplet, Blaise shot to her feet. She grabbed the vial in Alpha's hand, and threw her free arm in a punch to his elbow. Having forcibly removed it from his grasp, she dashed his stoppered container to the ground.<br><br>There was the sound of breaking glass... that didn't seem to end. As the vial hit the floor, blue liquid shot out of all sides, forming a puddle. The liquid glowed for a moment, and then shot upward into a vitreous pillar. The other tube hit, and Blaise used her hold on Alpha's arm to leverage him into the space behind the newly-created obstruction. She slammed him into it, quite a bit rougher than was necessary, and turned away.<br><br>After a brief pause, there was a loud bang as the reaction went critical. Alpha threw up his hands to cover his face. Glass shards sprayed through the room, a few hitting the pillar and leaving large slashes where they struck.<br><br>“Fortunately, we managed to preserve the base components for the production of further enhancers... On the more lamentable side of affairs, however, is the fact that in doing so, we expended all of our halting agent.” Blaise began to chew Alpha out, even with their ears still ringing from the blast. “Do you have so much as a <i>notion</i> of the amount of time and resources that I'll need to dedicate to synthesizing another cubic <i>centimeter</i>, never mind an entire accumulation of great enough quantity to undertake this procedure once again?”<br><br>She turned away, picking a shard of glass out of the desk as she sat down once more. She glanced around as if to verify that nothing was damaged before beginning to fuss with a container of clear fluid.<br><br>“Honestly, duplicate. I had presumed that the condition under which I had appropriated you was restitution for the time and effort expended when the progenitor-Brogue had spoliated my information about the Empiric school of mystic arts. However, it seems that the progenitor has bestowed me with little more than a white elephant of an aid... I do not comprehend whether this action is merely in spite of me, or if even the original has such as a gross level of incompetence, but I am most assuredly not amused with these antics.”<br><br>Somewhere amid Blaise’s words, Alpha had tried at least once to slip in an “I’m sorry.” But now that she’d turned her attention away from him, he found he wasn’t going to be able to repeat it in the silence. <br><br>He stood still for another moment, looking at the floor, then went to the closet to bring out a mop, bucket, dustpan and brush. <br><br>While he was sweeping the glass shards up, a couple of sentences that were not quite text and not quite speech entered his mind.<br><br><i>Buddy. My number-one guy. How’s it going?</i><br><br><br><br><div align="center"><font face="Braggadocio"><font size="7">ISHKABIBBLE</font><br><font size="6">SCENE ZERO</font></font><br><font face="Garamond"><font size="4">Paolo Undertakes Preparations to Look the Part of a Made Man</font></font></div><br><br><br><i>Saturday the 14th<br>1:46 am</i><br><br>Halfway around the world, in Winstone City, Terrian Brogue strode up the sidewalk toward the parking garage. His hair was ruffled. Busy night. Though he hadn’t stopped being surprised at how placid this city seemed when you were out on the street at the darkest hours. Not a soul in sight. Puritanical, that was the word. All the exciting things in Winstone happened indoors.<br><br>Ugly night, too, honestly. He couldn’t see the stars through the thick clouds overhead. The moon was a pallid dot. But was he in a mood for meteorological griping? No, Terrian was not. He felt much too good for that. Also too tired. Meteorological griping demanded energy.<br><br>Alpha’s response came in: <i>Complaining is a useless diversion.</i><br><br><i>Isn’t it, though? I was just thinking that. How’s our mutual friend? You’d tell me if she were experimenting on you to give you superpowers or something, right?</i><br><br><i>She hasn’t expressed any interest in my physical person.</i><br><br>Terrian chuckled as he crossed to the next block. <i>Just busywork, then. Hope that’s not too demanding.</i><br><br>There was a slight pause. Terrian waited for the bad news; he had come to expect slight pauses like this whenever Alpha was irritated. Poor guy. A red car wheeled slowly past, the first to do so in a while. Terrian squinted under the harsh headlights, and was still blinking as he received Alpha’s next reply.<br><br><i>It’s simple work, but plentiful. Her instructions occupy me so thoroughly, in fact, that I haven’t had a day’s free time to go study the English and French dialects in New Orleans. I think I recall you telling me that would be one of the perks of service to Ms. Euler.</i><br><br><i>No kidding? Um… sorry about that.</i> Terrian faltered, then hit on a change of course. <i>So what about her, anyway? Mention me at all?</i><br><br><i>Why, yes. At last check, she thinks you’re either an idiot or you have an awful sense of humor.</i><br><br><i>“Either”-“or”, now? Nice! I knew you’d make some progress there…</i><br><br>But a quick response from Alpha, <i>New task. Must talk to her,</i> cut the conversation short.<br><br>Terrian had reached the parking garage by now anyway. He passed the ticket booth, unmanned and automatic, and moved toward the stairs to the second level, where his car was parked.<br><br>Grubby place, this garage. He’d thought so about the buildings outside, too. This wasn’t the rich part of Winstone City. Classy architecture, like that fancy hotel with the Italian name, was not on display around these parts. All the more reason to hasten back to his lovely new home and get some sleep.<br></div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Q</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Paolo looked down at his worn shoes. <i>Damn,</i> he thought, <i>maybe after this next gig, I can actually get something that fits me.</i> Ever since the disagreement with the Red Hawks, Paolo had been sneaking off to make extra cash every couple of nights. He was still working with the gang, but the terms were different now. Paolo knew he wouldn't be sticking around them for much longer.<br><br>The god probably wouldn't let him, anyways. Not after the cash flow had been interrupted like that.<br><br>Paolo started at a sudden noise, and craned his neck awkwardly to look around the corner. Yes, someone was there, alright. A tall man, probably nearing his thirties, sharply dressed. The clap of his shoes echoed through the near-empty parking garage as he headed towards the nearest stairwell.<br><br><i>Now.</i><br><br>Paolo took a deep breath and rounded the corner. Briskly, he approached the other man from behind. The man reached out to pull open the door to the stairwell, turned to face Paolo, and smiled.<br><br>"After you."<br><br><i>Ugh, I hate it when they're polite.</i> Paolo smiled. "Thanks. Hey, do you know if this stairwell goes all the way up to the roof?"<br><br>"I think so, yeah." The man had a charming smile, and Paolo was taken aback. <i>Huh. This guy could be a good con man. Maybe he </i>is<i> a con man?</i><br><br>A deep, near-unintelligible voice rumbled somewhere in the back of Paolo's mind. <i>Stop wasting time.</i><br><br>Brought back to focus, Paolo grinned at the man and walked into the stairwell. He climbed a few stairs without looking back, waiting, waiting...<br><br>SLAM!<br><br>The door closing was Paolo's cue. Adrenaline surging, he spun around, leaped down the few stairs he'd climbed, and grabbed the stranger by the neck.<br><br>"Give me your money," he growled. <i>This is my favorite part.</i><br><br><br><br><i>OOC: Paolo has been getting good at this type of mugging recently. Let's hope his past experiences can help him out now, as he's met with a much smarter man than he's expecting...</i></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message"><i>OOC: Wasn't expecting that much autoing, Q, but man, it worked. Good job. And no worries about the length. This post'll be shorter still.</i><br><br>"Oh! -- you -- urgh--" Terrian spluttered. It felt like his heart had jumped to his throat. In fact that throbbing was just the veins in his neck, working overtime. The assailant had a grip like a bear trap. Stars were filling Terrian's vision, through which he tried to get a better look at the man.<br><br>But this was a <i>kid</i> -- that was immediately obvious -- he couldn't have been out of high school! Clearly wasn't trying to look the part of a student, though, in those grimy clothes, and with his hair slicked back like that. A little <i>hooligan</i>, that was what he was. A juvenile delinquent.<br><br>Who had a grip like a bear trap. Oh, and in the other hand, he was now pointing a gun at Terrian's ribs. This was a new development.<br><br>Terrian's arms were flung back against the concrete wall; he had no opportunity to retaliate. He didn't seem to be having much opportunity to breathe. He opened his mouth again to speak, hacked several times, and eventually got out: "'Kay -- ser'sly -- the -- with the <i>throat</i>--"</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Q</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Paolo felt a rush of guilt. He loosened his grip on the man's throat.<br><br><i>I'm sick of this. I'm hurting this poor man. Why am I doing this?</i><br><br><i>Don't you dare back down,</i> the voice in the back of his mind thundered louder than ever. <i>Don't mess this up. This man is going to be important to you.</i> Paolo was overcome with a sudden headache, and he winced as his fingers clenched again.<br><br>"Don't make me shoot you. Give me your money. Everything you've got. You got a nice car? Gimme your keys."<br><br>The man coughed and spluttered, and the thought echoed in Paolo's head again. <i>Why am I DOING this?</i><br><br>The deep voice replied. <i>You'll see.</i></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Terrian wheezed. His vision was darkening. If he hadn't been sure this would cause the attacker to shoot, he would have grabbed the boy's hand and tried to wrench it away from his throat. As it was, he could only choke out, "Yeah -- will -- le' go -- <i>please</i>--"<br><br>Which, funnily enough, seemed to accomplish something. The boy's grip relaxed again, and this time he relinquished his hold completely. Terrian slumped back against the wall, gasped for breath, and coughed at great length. The attacker's gun was still in place, but at least Terrian had regained the use of his lungs. Things were looking up.<br><br>"You--" Terrian coughed some more. "--god -- god<i>damn</i> -- So--" He reached into his jacket's inner pocket, feeling around for the wallet.<br><br>No, that wasn't it.<br><br>He tried the other pocket. There it was. He fished it out. "Hey, so... I think we're good--" Stringing together this many words at once set him into another coughing fit, under which he flipped the leather wallet open and pulled out the hundred-dollar bills. He counted them out. Nine altogether. He began to reach them out to the boy.<br><br>Then stopped. He'd noticed something about the last two. He checked them again, coughing some more. They both had the same serial number: FG 62323966 A.<br><br>Shit.<br><br>"Yeah..." He took a deep breath and cleared his throat. "Here you go. Don't, you know, spend it all at once."<br><br>He held out eight of the hundred-dollar bills to the boy. He had already peeled off one of the two duplicate bills and started to tuck it back into his pocket.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Q</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Paolo took the eight bills. He noticed that the stranger had pocketed a last bill, but seriously, eight-hundred dollars would be enough for now. Paolo relaxed his gun hand and lowered the weapon.<br><br><i>Get that last hundred,</i> the voice in Paolo's head snarled.<br><br><i>Come on, don't you think this is enough? I mean, honestly, we've put this guy through enough for one night...</i><br><br><i>You have the gun, you have the upper hand. Raise your weapon, boy.</i><br><br><i>I don't think this is a good idea.</i> Paolo frowned, avoiding the stranger's eyes.<br><br><i>It's not your choice.</i><br><br>Paolo's head suddenly throbbed. He let out a small cry of pain and pointed the gun at the man's chest.<br><br>"C'mon, man, I know you have more." <i>I'm so sorry, mister.</i></div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Beelzebibble</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Terrian's hand froze halfway to putting the last bill into his pocket. Damn. Well, it hadn't exactly been the stealthiest feat of <i>legerdemain</i> he'd ever tried. There'd just been no easy way to cover his bald mistake. How could he have been so stupid as to take out two copies of the same bill in one trip? How inattentive did he have to be to make an oversight like that?<br><br>But beating himself around the head wasn't the right thing to do just now. <i>Keeping</i> his head was priority number one. Terrian's first instinct was to just hand over the ninth bill. Hell, the kid would probably go blow it all on coke as soon as he got round the block... But what if he noticed the matching serial numbers? Terrian couldn't risk anyone putting two and two together, not even an anonymous thug like this... After all, the kid could know anyone. Could be in with the Mafia clan Terrian had heard about, that did business in this area. Looked Italian, actually, now that he thought of it.<br><br>Not seeing any more use trying to hide it, Terrian held the last hundred-dollar bill up, though he did not offer it out to the boy. He was wearing a slightly guilty grin.<br><br>"Really, pal," he said. "Go easy on me, would you? I've got to hit the gas station on the way back. Otherwise I'm walking home tonight."</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Paolo's first instinct was to let the man go. But before he could even form the thought in his mind, the god interfered.<br><br><i>GET THAT MONEY.</i><br><br>Paolo bit his lip. "Then I guess you're walking." He jammed the business end of his gun into the man's ribcage.<br><br>Deep inside, Paolo felt like breaking down and crying. The god had never manipulated him quite like this before. Although he could move his body freely, his mind was--for all intensive purposes--at the god's will, and he felt utterly powerless against it.<br><br>Paolo's facial expression was stern, but his thoughts were frantic. <i>Please, please stop it. Leave me alone.</i><br><br>The only reply from the god was a distant laugh.</div></div>

He watched the boy's gaze follow the bill as it fluttered, twirling over itself, to the floor. <br><br>Terrian's black shoe inched over to step on the paper. As he expected, the boy's eyes shot back up to his.<br><br>But Terrian had already drawn the pale-colored pistol from the other inner pocket of his jacket and aimed it at the attacker.<br><br>"Look. I'm really... I'm really not trying to be an asshole about this. But you want to do us both a favor and call it off while you're ahead? We ought to be cool, here. At this point.

How could the god desert him like this?<br><br><i>My gun doesn't even have any bullets.</i><br><br>"Okay. We're cool." Paolo held up his gun in one hand and the money in the other, and stepped back a few small paces. He bumped into the stair rail, balked, and turned to flee. <i>I've gotta get out of here.</i> He threw open the stairwell door and fled from the parking garage without a backwards glance.<br><br>The night outside was cool and fresh. After running down a maze of alleyways, Paolo stopped to breathe in the crisp air.<br><br><i>I can't afford to do this anymore.</i> He opened his left hand, which had been painfully clenched around the eight-hundred dollars.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Moving slowly, Terrian nudged the safety on the Mage Masher and tucked it back into his pocket. He looked up at the ceiling, but he couldn't see any cameras there in the stairwell. What an oversight. Of all the places not to think a mugging could happen. No, Terrian was relieved, really. He did so hate to draw attention to himself.<br><br>These days, anyway.<br><br>He started to move toward the staircase, and stopped when he noticed the rustling of paper underfoot. Why, he had been about to leave behind the ninth hundred-dollar bill. That was some kind of luxury, right there, being able to just forget that you'd dropped a hundred on the floor. He chuckled softly as he stooped to retrieve the bill, then relapsed into a coughing fit as he straightened up. He rubbed his neck. God, the kid'd had him in a vice. Or was that a vise? He couldn't remember how to spell it. He'd ask Alpha sometime.<br><br>Out of the stairwell and on the second floor, he strode a little hurriedly toward his dark teal sedan, one of the only vehicles parked up here. Modest little thing. No time yet to shop around and see if he could find something flashier. Priorities. He unlocked the front door, got in, and checked the fuel tank. Nearly full. Good; he'd thought so.<br><br>He started the engine and rolled the car down the ramp to the first floor.

He carefully folded the bills and placed them in his battered, long-empty wallet. He stuffed the sad wallet in a back pocket of his trousers.<br><br><i>Eight-hundred dollars. That should be enough to get myself dressed up to go and see the Giarrettiera family.</i> He ran a shaking hand through his hair. <i>Maybe I should even go get a haircut.</i><br><br>The moon shone dully in a cloud-heavy sky. Paolo could just make out its outline, obstructed by clouds and distorted by a cast-iron fire escape.<br><br><i>I've gotta do this just right if I ever want to get out of this mess. I've got a long road ahead of me.</i> He steadied himself on an aluminum garbage can, straightened up into a more confident pose, and walked out of the dark alley and into the electrically-lit street. He reached into his front trouser pocket, pulled out a small ball of crumpled paper, and unwrapped it. Pills. He popped one into his mouth and swallowed it with saliva.<br><br><i>I'll see you soon, Giarrettieras.</i></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Once out of the parking garage, Terrian drove his sedan up the street. As he'd expected, his was the only car on the dark pavement. Safe behind the wheel, he found himself starting to laugh, coughed the last cough, and then began laughing again. He wasn't entirely sure why. Maybe it was the fact that he'd just been mugged and he didn't even feel upset about it. Yeah, his legs were trembling a little bit, but... Terrian couldn't help it; his head fell back against the headrest as he laughed harder than ever. He'd been cleaned out of eight hundred dollars that he'd <i>never miss</i>.<br><br>Of course, he supposed he shouldn't make light of the situation. The kid could have been a crazy who'd have just shot him with no questions asked. And, god damn it, there was that ninth bill. <i>How</i> had Terrian let that happen? He'd be screening his hundreds very carefully from then on. Wasn't in the business of making administrative blunders like that...<br><br>He rubbed at his right eye as he came up to the next traffic light. He was looking forward to taking his pick of the eight bedrooms available to him at that <i>lovely</i> little mansion he was settling into. Then again, half the rooms were still blocked off by piles of boxes, so his options weren't really quite so plentiful. He yawned.<br><br>At the traffic light (red; <i>why</i>), he looked around idly, then blinked as a poster on the corner came into focus, illuminated by a flickering streetlamp. There was a familiar-looking woman depicted on the poster, dressed in pinks and purples and sporting an enormous feathered top hat. Well, he supposed he could have just squinted blearily at the huge name laid out in a brassy font above the top hat instead of squinting blearily at the top hat's wearer.<br><br><div align="center"><b>HELEN MERCURY<br>With <i>Real</i> Magic At Her Beck And Call!</b></div><br>"No kidding?" Terrian said aloud. He squinted blearily at the smaller text below Helen's violet heels. She was on tour, performing in Winstone from this weekend through to the next. Why, he couldn't miss an opportunity like that. He'd have to call her up tomorrow. Pretty sure he still had her number somewhere. He'd mysteriously found it on a slip of paper in his pocket after that incident at the Parmigianino Institute.<br><br>Oh, the light had been green for a while. There'd been no one to honk angrily behind him. Terrian moved a foot from the brake to the gas pedal and started into motion. Time to leave this grubby part of Winstone City behind.
