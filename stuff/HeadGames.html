Her green eyes stare at the water, following the colorful fish in their lazy swim around their new home. She ignores the morning sun peeking through the window to her left.<br><br>It would have been obvious that she was blond if the top of her head wasn't completely wrapped in bandages.<br><br>The young woman reaches for a canister next to the aquarium and shakes some of the contents into the tank. The tropical fish move upward with slightly more fervor than before, their fins flowing elegantly through the water and their scales catching the sun's soft glow. As they nibble at the floating flakes, their bodies bobble up and own with an irregular rhythm.<br><br>The girl smiles.</i><br><br>***<br><br>The sun had begun its steady march toward the horizon hours ago. Tree covered hills stood against the vibrant orange background casting large shadows along a now deserted highway. Hazy clouds reflected the light, creating a bright glow not unlike burning embers in the air.<br><br>Among the clouds, and the only visible sign of life for miles around were two birds in loose formation, soaring over the warm rising air that emanated from the winding highway. Already it was odd that they were too few to form a flock, and on closer inspection, it was even stranger that they were two different birds of prey. The larger of the two, a pure white golden eagle, flew slightly ahead of the other, a much smaller kestrel.<br><br>For a while, the pair continued following the expanse of asphalt, occasionally flapping to regain altitude and speed. Then, as if on cue, they both veered east along one of the highway exits. The uneven terrain became a flatter landscape as the birds continued their journey. Soon houses could be seen among the trees; one or two becoming clusters of five and six. The gray arteries snaking between the domiciles became more visible among the green treetops, growing denser and more clustered. Another moment passed, and the chaotic pattern solidified into a grid, with houses and apartments built into neat rows, though not close enough to become claustrophobic and not so dense that nature couldn't be inserted into controlled areas.<br><br>Still over what could be considered the town outskirts, the albino eagle descended. Before it landed, its entire shape began to deform. Its broad wings shrank and thickened into scarred human arms while the feathers shifted and merged together into a heavy black fabric. Talons formed into combat boots and featureless white took on a camouflage pattern to cover the lengthening legs. The bird's sharp visage flattened into an equally intense human stare.<br><br>Rie landed on her feet and immediately drew her rifle from under her cloak. The mission was simple: investigate the strange happenings in this relatively isolated town. It was a trial mission for the Obsidian Hearts. The pay wasn't great, and Natalie was accompanying. Normally Rie wouldn't accept such a boring mission for such meager pay with the added constraint of a partner (though at least Nat was competent); however, George mentioned a key piece of information: the paranormal occurrences could best be described as 'psychic,' and a young man with messy brown hair and reflective shades had been spotted in the area.<br><br><i>Ender...</i><br><br>Rie was on edge. It wasn't just the information. While flying, she couldn't see any movement toward the center of the town, and she could 'sense' something foreboding in the air. For anyone else, that wouldn't be abnormal, but for Rie, it wasn't a good sign. The girl never 'sensed' things. She only saw, heard, smelled, felt, or even tasted when things were dangerous, but she never got an uncomfortable tingle in her head or an unexplained shiver under her skin.<br><br>The girl scanned the area, pointing her rifle straight ahead. She waited for her companion to land.<br><br>***<br><br>A figure dressed in black lay prone on top of a hill, his form shaded by trees and wild grass. His hands gripped a long black and gray object; the device metallic and mechanical, elegant and intimidating. His head did not move from behind the sniper rifle's sight while his bare hand adjusted it.<br><br>His other hand took a bullet from a pouch and brought it to his nose. If he had eyelids over the lensed cylinders he called eyes, he would have closed them as he inhaled the scent of copper and gunpowder.<br><br>Intoxicating.<br><br>The man paused a moment longer then drew the implement across his stubble. He paused again before loading the bullet into the gun's chamber. Even his body stopped rising and falling with his breath as his entire body became still.<br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler1042458').toggle();if($('#spoiler1042458').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler1042458">PS. this is kind of closed for a couple posts, then it will be an obvious entrance to everyone</div></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">The smaller falcon wheeled inwards, around the point that Rie had chosen for a landing. It flapped twice, and gained a few feet of altitude. A moment later, in contrast to the other party’s elaborate changes, the bird was gone, and a girl had appeared. She dropped from the air, and landed on her hands and knees in a crouch. With another flicker, she was standing. A long, thin blade, composed of dozens of interlocked segments, was extended between her outstretched hands.<br><br>She ran her fingertips along the spine of the weapon, a series of quiet clicks accompanying her motion. At the end of the movement, both hands had assumed the proper position at the hilt of the sword.<br><br>Natalie glanced over at Rie, taking care not to focus too much of her attention on the girl. Though the two had associated on occasion, this was their first chance to actually work together properly.<br><br>She had left her typical Obsidian Hearts garb at base, opting instead for a grey denim jacket and black jeans. It wasn’t the most formidable of gear, but as far as Natalie could reckon, it was safer than gallivanting around in the armor she’d purloined from the Order of the Mamba. If Rie talked with Zebedee or Sly, and put two and two together…<br><br>Well, being implicated in trying to stab her friends in Washington and aiding in a kidnapping were not the best ways to endear herself to the others. As it was, since the festival in Shin-Ra, she’d been on thin ice with a few of them.<br><br>“Did you spot any people when we were descending? I thought I saw something, in one of the windows to the town hall, but it didn’t stick around. It mighta just been a reflection or something,” Natalie slowly glanced to her right, keeping her blade raised in a ready stance. Though there’d been reports of paranormal incidents up here, she hadn’t been expecting something quite this extreme. This was Bermuda Triangle-Twilight Zone bullshit.<br><br>She went to start walking forwards, and then stopped. Mentally, she cuffed herself upside the head.<br><br>Rie was using a rifle. To walk in front of her would be placing herself in the line of fire, and unlike with Emily, Nat had no idea on if Rie could sharpshoot around her. And if she was behind her newest partner, she’d have trouble bringing her sword to bear. Side by side movement was unlikely to work well either, since she’d still likely end up stabbing Rie by accident if anything attacked.<br><br>“So, how do you want to go about this? ‘fraid I’m not exactly-“ She paused, and flinched slightly. She was here to lead the mission, ostensibly. Even if Rie was her new partner, this was a matter of adapting the girl to working with her, and not the other way around.<br><br>“You know what? You take the lead. If there’s anything physically threatening, phase out of the way, and let me handle it. “<br>She didn’t feel great about putting Rie in front, letting her handle any threats that came up… But then again, it was a helluva lot better than getting shot in the back of the head.<br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler3125614').toggle();if($('#spoiler3125614').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler3125614">OOC: Ugh, overly introspective Nat post.

I think you wanted to have her do Ender/Nat flashbacks, anyway, right? Because I sure as hell am not writing romance posts. I only ship. I do not slash.</div><br><br>Rie didn't like taking orders while on missions. This is why she didn't like working with people. They always assumed she couldn't think on her own or coordinate on the fly. They never took into account that once the payment was made or promised, the escort or squad would never be deliberately hurt or put in harm's way; and they never took into account the fact that Rie had been built as a perfect killing machine, so not-killing was simply an extension of that.<br><br>Oh well. The girl didn't care enough about it to so much as change her facial expression. The demand was reasonable enough, as well.<br><br>"0k," Rie said as she moved forward, rifle trained ahead. The tingle in her head was more pronounced than it was in the air. It wasn't distracting. Just disconcerting.<br><br>"I haven't seen anything. The movement you saw was an advertisement reflection that—"<br><br>The girl stopped moving forward. She could hear something that sounded like a man humming a tune. She looked left, then right, then up. The sound had the same quality in every direction. She moved forward toward the corner of a house then crouched down and turned a full 180. Same volume. It was as if the humming was coming from every direction at once, which could only mean...<br><br>"There's a psychic present. Can you hear it?"<br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler4956460').toggle();if($('#spoiler4956460').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler4956460">OOC: Just one more post from you, Lee, to acknowledge the sound and I guess move us a little more down the street then the topic is open, since the head music is going to probably be the main way of attracting any rando passerby people.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">“Hear it? Not… No, not exactly,” Natalie kept her blade steady, cagily glancing around towards the flanks of the group. The lack of people had touched some portion of Nat’s subconscious, and was certainly making her uneasy. Humans, just like any other animal, occupied specific regions. And, just like any other animal, when they vanished en masse, it was a sign of something bad either lurking or on its way.<br><br>“Natalie.”<br><br>She stopped cold, Rie pausing an instant after the footsteps ceased.<br><br>“No, you’re right… There is some kind of voice. Like listening to a radio with no signal or something. I’m getting… shreds of it,” She didn’t mention hearing her name. She didn’t hear her name, in retrospect. It was-<br><br><i>Fuck.</i> Fucking <i>shit.</i> It was like when somebody with a familiar voice said something in another room, and you thought they were talking to you. Considering that the only telepaths Natalie had ever heard in her mind had been Sly and Ender…<br><br>“Rie, this-“ Natalie twitched slightly, her ponytail’s ends bobbing, “I shouldn’t fucking say this.”<br><br>Against her better discretion, she left her ready stance, and leaned against the craggy faux-stone siding of the house they were walking past.<br><br>Against her better judgement, she spoke.<br><br>“It… it really does sound like him, doesn’t it?”<br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler7954683').toggle();if($('#spoiler7954683').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler7954683">OOC: And here Lee goes, moving the plot about three rounds too fast!

        <div class="content"><div class="message">No. Rie didn't want to think that. But the baritone voice, the nonchalant rhythm, the hint of sarcasm in every note that sounded like the person humming knew they were off oh so slightly key and just kept going for shits and giggles...<br><br>The girl crouched behind a tree. Her face remained expressionless.<br><br>No.<br><br>"N-" She stopped short of whispering denial to herself. She didn't want to believe it, but the tune in her head brought memories of Ender listening to loud music from his room, the sound muffled slightly by the door.<br><br>Rie focused on her ears. She tried to focus on real sounds to ignore the subtle melodies dancing through her brain, but there was almost nothing to listen to. There was the quiet rustle made by a soft wind, but that was it. There was no rumble of motor vehicles, no sustained crunch of bikes, no patter of footsteps, and no voices from houses. Even the crickets were absent. <br><br>The silence almost amplified the telepath's hymn within Rie's head. The girl tried to pick out anything that didn't sound right with the voice, anything so that it couldn't be him...<br><br>"It does sound like him." She paused, considered taking a deep breath, then continued. "Let's keep moving."<br><br>She stood up and scanned the area again. Of course, no movement.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">“We really shouldn’t be getting weirded out by this shit, Rie,” Natalie thought aloud, pushing off of the wall. She fell into step behind her companion, and readied her blade again.<br><br>“I mean, for all we know, maybe he left some mind-linked MP3 player or something up here. That’d explain this all pretty neatly, really. Then, the only question would if he’d done it by accident, or if he did it just to screw with people.”<br><br>Natalie allowed herself a faint smile.<br><br>“Maybe he just set this up so that we’d have something to take the edge off, another one of his world-class pranks. Like the time where he had dozens of erotic cakes delivered to every U.S. Senator, and managed to bill the Vice President for it. Or the time where he hacked the North Korean military mainframe, and replaced pretty much every file with GIF’s of dancing animals, while bricking their nukes at the same time,” The shapeshifter had to bite her lip to avoid an addendum of “Those were the days.”<br><br>They might have been. For all she knew, she might never again find a friend or lover as awesome as Ender was. The world was a big place, but even amongst the billions, he’d been an exceptional person. But… The moment she resigned herself to thinking those were the best times in her life, she may as well lay down and die. Life was to be lived facing forwards, crushing whatever got in your way, and dragging along whatever was worth keeping with you. To declare her time with Ender as a permanent best, a glass-ceiling for her happiness, she was dragging his corpse through the mud and slowing herself down.<br><br>Natalie thrusted her chin forwards, and tightened her grip on her weapon. It was then that the pervasive melody shifted. It seemed to grow quieter for an instant, and then steadily began increasing in volume.<br><br>OOC: Well, I think that takes care of solo/private events. I’d say the RP is open as of Choobs’ next post.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message"><i>The young blond woman in plain gray clothes stands in a large white room. Fluorescent lights shine down from the ceiling. Everything is clean.<br><br>Her goal is simple: go through a door. In front of her, the girl sees the metal reinforced gateway, though it lacks a handle. She turns around and sees her reflection in what is probably a two-way mirror. <br><br>She walks up to the door and tries to push it. As expected, it doesn't move.<br><br>All it takes is a thought. Imagine the body as nothing. She feels the familiar tingle of electricity around the foreign object installed in her brain. She looks at her hand and sees the opaque skin quickly become translucent. Her nails, her scars, her hairs, her veins, her entire outline lose their solid definition and become a slight haze.<br><br>She presses against the door and feels a slight resistance, somewhat like moving through water. As she pushes through, her ethereal hand becomes an ethereal arm. The ghostly haze envelops her entire body and...<br><br>She can't breathe. The girl tries to inhale. Her lungs expand, but don't catch a single oxygen particle. She tries to phase her lungs back to a physical form, but they catch in the door. It hurts, and on instinct, the girl phases them out again and hurries through the cold, dark metal.</i><br><br>***<br><br>"No, he said he wouldn't do anything like that." He never lied to her because she couldn't lie to him, even though she never felt the urge to lie about things in the first place.<br><br>Rie nearly stumbled over when the humming just stopped. It had been almost comforting to hear something like his voice in her mind again, and she had been getting used to its presence. Like all white noise, it was most noticeable when it ceased. The sharp rise in volume momentarily after that froze the girl midstep for a fraction of a second.<br><br>"We need to find out where this music is coming from.

        <h2 class="poster">AngelicTragedy</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Two large figured snapped into being on either side of Nat and Rie, a pair of wickedly sharp spears pointed at their hearts.  The man facing Nat seemed to have a calm grace about him, but the one facing Rie didn’t seem so confident in their prey.  The pair wore matching battle armor of dense black leather emblazoned with emerald flames and masks that covered all o their head and neck.  Yellow light flashed from the eyes of the mask before Nat and shone with an acidic quality, while the mask before Rie lit up in a dull orange tone.<br><br>“Tekra eek noova marek?” Hissed a hallow voice from behind the yellow eyes, the statement directed to both of the women present.<br><br>“Kuldotha, balu hess melkana Dramon Lorsha ellba volk…” an equally hollow but timid voice almost whispered from below the mask of the man facing Rie.<br><br>“Tevrek, balu xeln ater.  Tekra eek noova marek?!” the yell was muffled slightly, but no less forceful as the yellow eyes figure jabbed at Nat’s shoulder.<br><br>Three things happened in that moment almost more quickly than could be seen properly.  Firstly, the spear that was aimed for Nat’s flesh exploded into dust and was swept away on the wind.  Secondly, the attacking man was rocketed backwards like a skipping stone.  Finally, another man appeared, this one larger than the others, with gleaming amethyst eyes.  This figure was dressed in thick black clothing trimmed in silver and ribbed with purple leather.  The figure held himself with a regal confidence about him that was both ensuring and frightening.  The standing warrior threw his spear away and dropped to his knees, slamming his face in the dirt, at the appearance of the gem eyed figure, but his partner wasn’t in a position to do the same.<br><br>“Etra vec, Kuldotha!  Lordessa, tetmal wonvel aouvon.” Ordered the man behind the purple mask and seconds later both of the others were gone just as quickly as they had appeared.<br><br>“I apologize for the actions of my Hunters.  They may be good at what they do, but they aren’t exactly the most tactful bunch.” The more familiar voice from under the mask said, be it still in a hollow tone.<br><br>Valon Lorsha turned on the spot, the black mask that covered his face melted into his jacket like liquid cloth, leaving his head bear if not a bit damp from sweat.  Valon knew that he didn’t have to speak about why he was here simply because he knew that the pair before him came here for the same reason.  The music had called out to him like a beacon, but he had not noticed the familiar tone to it until he had sent in a pair of Hunters to investigate.  The fact that his own personal force had drawn weapons on Nat and Rie made Valon feel sick, but there was no changing the past.  <br><br>“The music can be heard in Drakengrad by those who are sensitive to this type of thing, so I chose ot some myself once I started hearing…well, you know.  Do you believe that it’s really him, or could someone be trying to lure everyone together again?” <br></div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Yoshimitsu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Yoshimitsu perched on the windowsill, keeping perfectly still. He didn't know who the house belonged to, but that wasn't particularly important to him right now. They had left their door unlocked, and no one was home. If they suddenly returned, he'd make his excuses and leave. Somehow, he doubted that would happen. Not a single soul had passed his vision while he had been in town. That alone was worth investigating.<br><br>"What's going on..." He muttered to himself, his lips barely moving.<br><br>Normally, he would have been out trying to discover what was going on. Getting to the cause of the problem as quickly as possible, saving the day and all that. Today was not a normal day though. Something was unsettling him, but he couldn't decide what. A general feeling of unease. It was putting him on edge. It was almost enough to send him running from the town. He was made of stronger stuff than that, though. Nothing could send him running any more.<br><br>A humming. Something that nearly caused Yoshimitsu to jump. It sent prickles along his skin, his hair standing on end. He didn't dare turn his head, in case there was someone out there who could see him. It was obvious that the humming was not coming from him or anyone else in the room. It wasn't right. It wasn't even a proper tune. As though someone was deliberately trying to annoy him. And there was a tone in there, something snarky or deliberately irritating. He concluded it was being sent directly into his mind.<br><br>"A telepath..?" He muttered, keeping his figure as still as possible.<br><br>Something outside caught his eye. Movement. People. He looked in their direction. Two girls, one of them was very familiar looking. That was Nat. What was Nat doing here? Just as he was about to move, another two figures appeared, both armed. He kept still, watching the scene play out in front of him. A third figure appeared, another easily recognisable person. Valon. Something very serious was happening here. Yoshimitsu slid the window open and pulled himself through it. His landing was silent.<br><br>"So I'm not the only one a bit weirded out by this?" Yoshimitsu asked, striding towards the small group. "It's good to see you, Nat."</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">As soon as the two hunters had appeared, Rie already had her rifle trained on them. She was about to shoot, too, when they had been thrown off by another arrival: Valon. <br><br>"Do you believe that it’s really him, or could someone be trying to lure everyone together again?"<br><br>A lure. A trap. Maybe. Rie hoped it was a trap. Traps were easier to deal with than dead friends coming back to life.<br><br>"I don't want to jump to any conclusions. We'll see what it is when we find the source of the music."<br><br>Something else was coming toward the group. Rie swung her rifle around to find a blue-haired teenager walking casually toward them. He said some stuff. Apparently he knew Nat. The girl lowered her rifle slightly, though she kept her glare on the kid to make sure he didn't try anything. She didn't bother introducing herself.<br><br>Anyone else? Rie scanned rooftops, windows, and alleys in the near vicinity. She was hoping that something else would come out, just to prove that this entire area wasn't dead. The two that had just arrived were clearly investigating and probably didn't know anything.<br><br>"If you guys are also trying to figure out what's going on here, then you might as well help us find the sou—"<br><br>Above the buildings, toward the center of town, there was a brief flash of blue. It was just enough to get Rie's attention. A moment later, however, the music stopped, and massive spikes of blinding blue energy arced into the air from the same general direction. A roar of telepathic noise, sounding somewhere between a thunderclap and an explosion, echoed in everyone's minds shortly after the psionic lightning.<br><br>The humming started again. Rie was already running toward where the light had come from. She didn't care whether or not the rest were following. She wasn't even holding her rifle properly.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Hex</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Prime was following something familiar when he ran into the odd group, and suddenly stopped short. He looked from face to face, somewhat unsure what to say, and he got a vague sense of forboding from the largest man. Valon, his elusive memory supplied, though that was all. <br><br>Additionally he was able to identify Natalie, Rie, and Yoshimitsu. He actually felt rather proud of himself, most often his memories were less than fourthcoming. <br><br>"Well, hello everyone." Prime said amiably, leaning on a sword that came up to around his chest. It had a long, thick blade. Only coming to a point with the last 4 inches of its length. The cool metal was tainted blue, with a two handed hilt that still sported a basket grip.<br><br>Prime himself was wearing attire beyond odd, a quicksilver made cloth sort of substance covering his body. Over which he was wearing a long cloak, parted only slightly with sword in hand.<br><br>A crack broke across the air as he spoke, and he didn't even have time to get out a second sentence as one of the party took off. Prime raised his hand hesitantly, then relented and shrugged. He looked back to the remainder, wondering what action they'd take.<br><br>For himself, he already knew. That crack of light was intensely familiar, and he'd very much like the know the source.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">“We might just be chasing ghosts, Rie,” Natalie murmured, and loosened her grip on her blade slightly.<br><br>“You heard the story of the Will’o’Wisp, right? A ball of flame that lured idiots to their deaths, since they couldn’t tell the difference between a piece of fungus and a light in a window.”<br><br>“I know you miss him, and I miss him too. But all said, it’s a lot more likely that we’re just applying our own biases to a situation that has nothing to do with him, and we’re just going to find some small time telepath trying for a record deal, or something else equally retarded. It would be really fucking nice if something could work out happily for us for once, but I’m putting my money on ‘amateur telepathy open mike night’ over ‘Ender randomly comes back from the dead and then screws up a whole town for the hell of it,’” Her sword’s tip raised again, catching the light for a moment. Nat’s lips were smiling, though her eyes seemed a bit wetter than usual.<br><br>It was then that the two figures appeared. Natalie dropped her sword in an instant, doing her best to curb the apparent aggression of the motion. Then, deciding she’d met her requirements for ‘diplomacy’, she proceeded to extend both middle fingers from her clenched fists, and then held up both arms in the default position of surrender.<br><br>“Tekra eek fuck you and your little friend too,” She retorted with a sneer, and then vanished as the venom-eyed warrior stabbed at her arm. She reappeared in a crouch, and was just starting to move into an uppercut when Valon disarmed the assailant.<br><br>“Before your lovely homeboys turned up, I’d just been telling Rie that I think this is all a bunch of bullshit, and the similarity to Ender was just coincidence. Considering that you can hear this from Drakengrad, though, at least it means our mystery man is not as much of a pushover as I’d been expecting. That’s the first real good news of the day,” Natalie took a few more steps before Yoshimitsu came rocketing down from a window.<br><br>“To be honest with you, Yosh, I’m less weirded out by the situation with the music, and more weirded out by how many people we’re picking up here. It’s seeming like they’re trying to catch a bunch of attention, whoever our mystery man is… Though considering present company, it pretty much means that they’ve succeeded in calling the world’s biggest freakin’ hammer down on themselves.”<br><br>It was then that the skyline decided to turn into a piece of abstract art, huge jets of blue light exploding up from the center of the town. For a moment, the earth seemed cast in cerulean hues, the display overwhelming all other light available. Nat shielded her eyes, but grinned wildly, watching the explosion as it roared inside her skull.<br><br>“Okay, that’s much, much better. If they can do something like that, they’re actually worth my fucking time. Maybe we’ll even get a new referral or something, if we don’t have to stab their ass,” Her teeth remained bared, her sword switching in her hand like the tail of a cat about to pounce.<br>“Yeah, yeah, nice to see you too Prime. We’ve got a lead, so try and keep up, and we’ll chat on the way,” Natalie vanished, and reappeared a good couple yards away. She was sprinting full out after Rie, her arms pumping furiously. She hurdled a mailbox in a single bound, not even slowing as she landed.<br><br>“C’mon!”</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Prime was at angle to the ground, his legs pushing powerfully to keep up with Nat. The mirrorlike substance of attire created rich, rushing mirrored patterns across his body as he ran.<br><br>"So I guess you know who I am." Prime said, nodding to Nat. "Sorry to say I don't know who you are, though for some reason I'm not surprised you know me."<br><br>Prime cleared his throat, one hand on the hilt of his blade, keeping it clear of his legs as he ran. The blue explosion had left a blazing afterimage in his eyes, but he'd had some experience with that before and he was quickly recovering.<br><br>Prime scowled, sensing the currents around him. Something was really beginning to strike him as off. Before, he'd been following something familiar to his memory. Now, however, being so close to it... <br><br>He sensed an undercurrent of wrongness, maybe not really tangible, more like a gut feeling. His nerves were telling him with concrete certainty that something about the situation was wrong.<br><br>Prime chose to trust his instincts, and so spoke again to Nat.<br><br>"Something about this doesn't feel right, my instincts are telling me something is wrong with this situation. I can't say why though, or even point at something concrete or evident. Something just isn't right." He gestured in the direction of the former lightning bolt, "And I don't think its coming from there either. That's power, and violence. Its easy to read and completely unsubtle. I think my instincts are trying to point elsewhere." He finished.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Yoshimitsu kept pace with Nat and Prime easily, but the strange sensation and that terrifying feeling stopped him from catching up to Rie. They were headed towards some explosion that was probably intentionally drawing them towards it. He couldn't shake the freaked out feeling, but now he couldn't ignore the possibility that they were headed into a trap.<br><br>"If they're drawing out heavy hitters, then they must at least think they can match us," Yoshimitsu replied to Nat, the Bahamut Blade materialising in his hand instantly. Normally, he would wait to summon his sword. Today, though, he couldn't be too careful. The explosion was still ringing in his head, echoing around his skull constantly. Psychic powers weren't something he came across often. It was rattling him more than he cared to admit.<br><br>"I agree with Prime here," he continued, after listening to his amnesiac friend's thoughts. "At least, about the power and violence. This whole thing feels like a trap. I'm all for adventure but not running into a fatal situation."<br><br>Yoshimitsu's grip on his sword grew tighter as they followed Rie. There was no hiding his emotions right now.</div></div>

The massive surge of raw power seemed to be effecting his very being, and Valon really didn't like it.  Black sparks danced around Valon's fingers and played in his hair as the aftershock of what had just appeared before them washed over him.  Pain, a pain like white-hot fire, raced through his chest and caught his breath in his lungs.<br><br>"What is going on with me?" Valon asked himself as he watched the black arcs running along his flesh.  "Let's hope that whatever this is doesn't continue to effect me if this turns into a fight, or I may not be of any use."<br><br>On that thought, Valon slipped into a comfortable trot and then into a run towards the others.  The first that that he noticed as he neared was an oppressive clenching in his chest like a very strong person had him wrapped in a bear hug.  Valon slowed as what air he had remaining in his lungs vanished as he skidded to a stop just behind the others.  Valon hardened his expression as he drew in heavy breathes against the weight his felt and released his massive white scythe.  He felt as if they were on the same page; it didn't feel right here, and it wasn't just the pressure that only seemed to effect Valon.<br><br><i>"Please let this pass quickly.  I don't know if I can take a whole lot more of this pressure..."</i></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message"><i>Shapeshift, about 13 years old, sat in a metal chair behind a metal table. Metal cuffs were locked tightly around her wrists and ankles.<br><br>"Amorph is currently in the medical bay," a man said from the opposite side of the table. "This was supposed to be nonlethal combat. If it weren't for his implants, he would be dead right now. Multiple lacerations to the right shoulder, many near the jugular and brachial artery."<br><br>Shapeshift seemed to smile for a moment, then her expression became neutral again.<br><br>"We took you in to stop you from butchering things." The man sighed. "We're going to have to open your head up again."<br><br>Shapeshift's eyes widened. "It was an accident, I swear!"<br><br>"Shapeshift, we know your attacks were intended to be lethal."<br><br>"But you gave us sharp knives!" The girl stood up, her chair briefly scraping the ground before toppling over with a heavy clatter.<br><br>"Because you two have the best control over small bladed weapons."<br><br>"I'm sorry. I really am." There was a faint hint of water in Shapeshift's eyes. She was slowly shuffling away from the table.<br><br>"Guards."<br><br>Two large men, one holding an uncapped syringe, approached the girl from behind. One took her arm, and before she could wiggle free, he threw her to the ground. She tried to catch herself, but the cuffs on her legs kept her from shifting her feet. The girl felt a pinprick in her neck as the one with the syringe injected her with tranquilizers.<br><br>"Bring her to the lab. We might as well try the next phasing implant while we perform the lobotomy. Hopefully it won't kill her like the other two."</i><br><br><hr><br><br>Rie was at full sprint. On a good day, this averaged around 75 km/h. Today she was slightly faster. The girl took a wide turn at the next corner.<br><br>Ahead of her was a park. Judging by the distance she ran, and the relative position of the energy in the sky, the source would be there. She pushed herself harder.<br><br>Even from the distance, her bioengineered eyes could see details that most humans would miss closer up. Green grass surrounded a small playground set over a presumably rubber surface. The field was big enough for a child-sized soccer goal, unrusted, but lacking a net. The playground had a slide. It had two swings. One of the swings had a person. At his feet, there was something else that was not a person.<br><br>The person on the swing had messy brown hair. His hands cradled his head, as if he had a headache of some sort. He was wearing a long black trenchcoat.<br><br>Rie tried to push herself faster. Feeling her legs burn was something she was not used to.<br><br>"Ender!"<br><br>The person looked up, reflective shades catching the last glimmer of the setting sun. <br><br>The girl was at the edge of the field by now. By the time she slowed herself, she was at the edge of the rubber playground. <br><br>"Hey, Rie," the boy said. He was still sitting hunched over in the swing. He had a slight grin on his face. At his feet, there was some kind of humanoid creature. Mechanical parts jutted out at grotesque angles.<br><br>"You're alive..." The girl took a step forward.<br><br>"Wait!" The boy slowly got to his feet. He pushed up his shades. There was a crackle of blue energy around the finger he used, which suddenly went transparent. Almost as fast as it faded, it came back. "I know it's been a while, and I have no idea how the hell I'm here, but I'm having a hard time keeping myself together. Then this thing attacked," he pointed at the creature, "and I really don't know if my body can take any more physical contact. Gen 5ers, remember? Brings back memories, or something like that."<br><br>"But—"<br><br>"Hey, I miss you, alright? I really do. But, shit, I can sense more of these guys coming in close. I need to get out of here. Also I see Nat coming in behind you, and I think the first thing she's going to do is hit me." The boy forced a laugh. "There's a hill with a tree over that way. Meet me there, okay?"<br><br>"Ender!"<br><br>The boy had already turned around and was making a dash for the trees. He wasn't as fast as Rie in a sprint, but the girl couldn't move. It was really him. She needed to know how. She needed to know why. <br><br>He was already through the trees when she could feel her legs again. Endorphins from the earlier sprint were still flowing through her veins. She leaned forward and began to run.<br><br>A dash of movement behind the trees. Not human. Fast. Rie didn't care. She let her rifle hang loosely on her back as she ran forward.<br><br>"ENDER!"<br><br>Something stepped out from the foliage. It resembled a wolf as it trotted forward on all fours, but its posture was all wrong. The body was shaped for something that was meant to walk erect. Mechanical components jutted out and covered the creature's blackened skin. Its head was human, and the lower jaw had been replaced with metal.<br><br>Rie kept running forward. She saw the threat, but didn't change course. Instead, she leaped forward. While midair, her limbs expanded. Her body bloated almost explosively. Her clothes were replaced with a thick, wrinkled white skin. A large horn erupted from her head. <br><br>The rhinoceros landed heavily continuing with all the speed she had built up from the sprint. She lowered her head, aiming to impale the gen5 beast, or at least throw it to the side. The creature responded to this threat by rearing up on its hind legs, taking a stable stance. Claws extended from its hands, and it caught Rie by the head and front leg, heaving her into the air and into the ground.<br><br>The girl merely disappeared into the earth on impact. Moments later, an albino python flew out of the ground and wrapped around the creature's torso. The beast twisted 180 degrees at the waist in an attempt to face the girl or dislodge her, but Rie knew where its joints were; she had wrapped herself above the pivot. Still firmly attached, the python's top half erupted into the girl's torso. She reached an ethereal hand for the beast's head, attempting to forcefully remove its brain, but her hand stopped at the thick skin as if she had not bothered phasing in the first place. <br><br>The creature reached its clawed hands back at an unnatural angle and took the girl by the shoulders. She tried to phase, but still felt its cold grip on her. <br><br>It pulled. Rie didn't resist; trying to maintain her constricting grip would only cause more damage to herself. As she was flipped over the beast's head, she pulled a pistol from her hip and pressed it to the creature's eye. The girl pulled the trigger five times.<br><br>Rie was still thrown to the ground, phasing through her rifle, but the beast had released her and was stumbling backward. Not letting this momentary respite go to waste, the girl sprang to her feet, spun around, and pointed her gun at the enemy. She emptied the rest of the clip into its face.<br><br>As the beast fell, she saw six more Gen 5's emerge from the woods. She holstered her pistol and pulled out her rifle.</div></div>

He felt empathic indignation, anger, rage and humiliation. In him was a sense of being forced, and his bile rose. He felt as though he were a slave, his confines choking him. Has masters torturing him.<br><br>His anger slowly rose.<br><br>As he rounded the last corner and spotted Rie, their new enemies rattled him, and a sense of wrongness pervaded his body. Instinct impelled him to act.<br><br>"Yoshi!" Prime called out of instinct, taking a half step back and hopping into the air. The flat of the Bahamut blade impacted into his feet, propelling him forwards. Some...competative combat had taken place in the past, allowing the two to know each others styles.<br><br>Prime barreled, shoulder first, into the first wolfish creature. It was rammed into a tree, Prime hammering the breath from it. He pushing off with his elbow, bringing the blade of his sword across its chest and arm as he shot back. Bright sparks skittered across the plating, opening flesh as the blade passed over its more vulnerable extremities. <br><br>It snarled, grabbing Prime by the leg and flinging him towards one of its cohorts. The second grinning monster opened it maw wide, intending to swallow Prime, only to find a sharp mirrored sky blade buried there. It made a snarling choke, then ripped Prime's hands from his blade.<br><br>Several angry blows landed on Prime's chest before he was flung to the ground, the young man grunting as he struggled to keep air in his lungs. He coughed up blood as he was finally flung to the ground, the werelike creature following him.<br><br>He hand shot out for the hilt of his blade, his foot suddenly pressed against the creatures chest.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Yoshimitsu landed lightly, hopping back to put a little more distance between him and the monstrocity currently staring at him. The Bahamut Blade faded away as Yoshimitsu ran a quick systems check on himself. Nothing broken, no bruises, no cuts. He was doing quite well, considering everything was putting him on edge right now. As the beast lunged again, he dodged under the swiping arm and flipped over the thrust from its other abnormally large claw. A graceful movement that ended in his heel being planted in the monster's forehead. He twisted, using the monster as a foothold, and kicked away again.<br><br>It was strange how focused the blue haired teenager felt right now. The whole situation was suspicious, and a little bit creepy. It had been a very long time since he'd felt so thoroughly unnverved by anything. The chill in his spine and the constant state of alarm was enough to make him concentrate on everything here. Tiny little details that he would have missed otherwise. It wasn't long before Yoshimitsu realised what he was feeling. <br><br>Fear.<br><br>The Bahamut Blade reappeared in his hand, followed rapidly by plate-armour up Yoshimitsu's arm. There was a small change in the style this time; the blade itself was coming from Bahamut's mouth directly, and following the direction of his face. The neck twisted easily according to Yoshimitsu's movements. He was improving under the stress. The blade erupted in blue and golden flames as he charged again.<br><br><i>"Goddammit, they're fast,"</i> Yoshimitsu thought to himself, gritting his teeth. He spun round a strike, and followed through with a quick swipe to the back of the creature's head. Undeterred, the Gen 5 beast continued its assault and its claws sliced open Yoshimitsu's unguarded arm. Swearing under his breath, Yoshimitsu hopped back then struck again with an upward slash aimed at the beast's chin. Its skin was tough, and the metal tougher. Aiming for an easy kill was out of the question, but he knew he had to end the fight as quickly as possible. There was no doubt in his mind that this beast would learn how he fought quickly. <br><br>Choosing something a bit unconventional, Yoshimitsu ran at the beast again. As it aimed to snatch him from the air, Yoshimitsu dropped and slid underneath the monster's reach. As he continued to slide underneath his opponent, Yoshimitsu swung his sword powerfully overhead. The tip of the blade cut straight into the beast's arm, and the momentum of the slide forced it to carry on. Once past the beast, Yoshimitsu flipped to his feet and pointed his fist down. A series of spiralling beams shot downwards, some piercing the beast and some missing entirely. <br><br><i>"This is gonna be disgusting,"</i> Yoshimitsu thought as he formulated another plan. He descended quickly and brought the edge of his blade down first, catching the beast unawares and driving the blade into its head. Yoshimitsu quickly wrapped his arm and blade around the creature's neck, sharp edge pressing against it's neck. With a quick, sudden pull, he sliced its neck straight open. Leaving no chance for response, he planed his free palm on the open would and sent another round of spiralling beams into the beast's body.<br><br>Again using the beast as a foothold, Yoshimitsu jumped away. The free flow of Light in the creature's body was fatal, tearing it apart from the inside out.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Valon shot past Yoshi like a beast back from the dead.  The dark sparks no longer danced across his frame and he seemed to be whole once again.  The scythe that he wielded seemed to weigh nothing in his hands as he spun it like a massive shuriken.  Valon didn’t wait for one of the beasts to attack him, but chose to take the lead and sliced the lower jaw of the nearest monstrosity cleanly away.  The horror had more fight in it than Valon gave it credit for and leaped at the King of Dragon’s throat with a pair of wickedly sharp claws.  Valon slid to the side and caught the half human creation by the elbow and, with a quick shove, snapped the joint and knocked the beast off its feet.<br><br>Valon began to smile inwardly but stopped short as his opponent rose slowly at an odd angle.  A brief wave of panic washed over his mind but was just as quickly fought down as it had come.  Though the horrors looked human they seemed to lack minds and souls, which suited Valon just fine.  It meant he didn’t have to hold back.<br><br>“Come on!” Valon taunted the twisted humanoid as he lowered himself into an aggressive posture.<br><br>A low, rumbling growl rolled from the gullet of the disabled experiment as it matched Valon’s stance.  The two opponents locked eyes for a few moments before beginning their attacks.  The horror pulled its working arm up as if to use it as a spear against Valon whom held his scythe low and behind himself.   The pair clashed against one another, scythe and claw sang against one another in a disturbing song of battle.  Valon shoved sharply against his foe and knocked it off balance once again, but the horror never made it to the ground in one piece.  Valon teleported his scythe just behind the beast and pulled up sharply while pushing the mangled body down with his foot.  The experiment split cleanly in two but tried to get at Valon’s flesh once again.  Valon smirked and sent the two halves of the monster skyward and threw his open palm towards the flailing body.<br><br>“Grandeur Wave.” Valon breathed and let the flood gates in himself open.<br><br>The usual massive blue beam of the Grandeur Wave didn’t appear, but a beam of obsidian plasma lanced upward and vaporized the horror.  Valon lowered his hand and watched as more dark sparks ran along his skin like a web of tainted electricity.  Worry darkened Valons expression as he watched the energy fade from his flesh, worry that cut deeper than he really cared to show.  Luckily, Valon didn’t have to stew in himself for long as another horror leapt through the ash that was its ally and straight for Valon’s throat.  Valon’s mighty fist met with the beasts face and sent it skidding back a long ways across the battlefield.<br><br>“You picked the wrong time.  Let’s do this your way.” Valon growled acidly as he dismissed his scythe and cracked his knuckles while his new foe staggered back to its feet and began back at him.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Regular heart pumps, steady hands, blank mind.<br><br>The beast charged the King of Dragons, but before it could take three steps, its shoulder rocked back, the motion as good as synchronized with the loud bang of a rifle. Rie was not one for playing fair in a fist fight. Another bullet whizzed by Valon's ear, hitting the beast in the forehead plate and snapping its head back. The unnatural movement did not produce the cracking noise of a breaking spine; it only sounded like a motor being over-torqued. <br><br>Battle. This was comfortable. No thoughts, no emotions. Just bullets, blades, and blood. Physical pain was better than mental confusion.<br><br>Rie stood straight and silently while aiming her rifle at the beast's exposed neck. She pulled the trigger, but the thing shifted, causing the bullet to ricochet off its collarbone. The beast then stepped back and snapped its head forward again. It screeched through its broken metal jaws. The cry was not pain, but fury.<br><br>The girl suddenly noticed movement to her right. Rie ducked and rolled out of the way as the other beast leaped at her. Her cloak caught on the beast's head, and the girl didn't think twice before phasing out of it. She aimed her rifle at the new threat as its jaws snapped through the black fabric, only to see Natalie's foot meeting the its covered face. They were too close and the movement was too chaotic for a clean shot now, so the girl turned around to assess the beast that was about to attack Valon. <br><br>They, too, were in close quarters, grappling one another to get the upper hand. The beast's organic muscles bulged, though the pistons and motors that gave it extra power shifted and rotated around the body, repositioning themselves to multiply strength where needed. Despite the technological shifting, Valon still managed to push the beast back, releasing his right hand grip to punch its head again before throwing it to the ground. It skidded through the grass for a meter or so.<br><br>There was enough distance now. Rie released a burst of automatic fire, five shots peppering the beast in the torso. She pulled the trigger again, putting five more rounds into the creature's head. It jerked to the side while attempting to regain its composure, but its movements where answered by another burst of fire. A thick brown fluid sprayed from its head, and before the beast could begin twitching again, the King of Dragons landed knee-first on its neck.<br><br>Rie didn't wait for the finishing move to turn around to assess Natalie's fight. She was vaguely aware of sizzling energy, but she didn't care.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">The moment Natalie noticed the unearthly abomination, she threw herself into a low sprint. It loped to meet her, joints grinding and popping as the machinery pushed the cartilage and bone past its normal limits. It threw itself into a pounce, saber like claws ripping their way out of its hands.<br><br>Natalie stopped instantly, and vanished. A moment later, she reappeared in midair, stomping into the back of the beast’s head with both feet. It slammed into the pavement, the bits of metal in its face sparking as it skidded along. Its hindquarters twisted one hundred and eighty degrees, the smooth growl of ball bearings coming from somewhere within. The shapeshifter twisted, and raised her forearm to block the slashing kicks.<br><br>The impact hurled her back, blood spraying from the red tracks across her arm. The beast twisted and jerked back into a standing motion, clicking and crunching with every movement.<br><br>“I think I’m due some frickin’ answers, pal. Not that I really can expect any from you, but-“ The cyborg lunged once more, swinging with a bearlike lurch. The blow seemingly passed through Natalie, the warrior having made an immediate transition to a new stance. Her blade jutting behind her in a reverse grip, she lashed with a backhanded blow. The weapon coiled around the experiment’s barrel chest, sparking off metal and biting into flesh.<br><br>“I swear, it’s like I only fight fuckin’ shortbus rejects,” Natalie brought up her hand, catching the wrist of the lupine monstrosity. The force of the blow carried her in a semicircle, a spray of tan dust getting kicked up. She allowed herself a grin, and used her grip on the blade to wrench it free of the beast’s flesh. The blade was chipped and virtually edgeless from grinding into the ferrous components and hardened hide.<br><br>Oh fucking well. She threw it aside, and ducked under the beast’s reach. The lazy-susan waist didn’t exactly allow for much vertical range, it seemed. At least the later experiments could make a better effort at tying their shoes. Taking hold of a metallic bar jutting from its torso, Natalie pitched forwards and flung the manufactured horror over herself in a perfect hip toss. She vanished before it hit the ground, and resumed existence kneeling on the opposite side of her victim. She seized its head in both hands, and exploded to a standing position. The twist in its neck was… somewhat badly complicated by its full weight landing on that very point. It slumped over, limbs jerking erratically. <br><br>She pushed the spasming, dieing creature away from her. She looked up as she dusted her hands on her jeans. With a sigh, she blew a wet strand of hair out of her eyes.<br><br>Something caught her eye from the bushes, the glint of glass in the sunlight. Her vision snapped to the spot. A familiar face peered at her from the foliage at the edge of the clearing, his hand slowly going to his mirrored shades. He lowered them with his fingertips, something she'd rarely seen him do before. He had to be in quite a bit of pain if he couldn't muster the telekinetic force to lift his sunglasses.<br><br>His eyes glistened slightly, happiness tinged with just a touch of regret. They looked as they had before he'd started falling apart, before all the horrors that Genlab had inflicted upon him took their final toll.<br><br>"You son of a bitch…" Natalie whispered weakly, meeting his gaze.<br><br>"I'm…" She couldn't finish the sentence, a pained breath cutting off her next word.<br>--------<br>"You don't really get views like this anywhere else in the world," Ender said quietly, idly swinging his legs. The granite of the cliff face had been warmed by the afternoon sunlight, making a perfectly comfortable perch for the couple.<br><br>"Well, there is the sea of glass in the southwest of the U. S., but…" Natalie paused, and then turned to face her beloved, "Ya, you wouldn't be too interested in that. It's pretty fuckin' dull, being in the desert and all."<br><br>Ender most likely wouldn't want to hear much about nuclear testing facilities, really. It was stupid of her to even bring it up, the grave of yet another superweapon those in power had mastered and then discarded.<br><br>"That's sweet, worrying about how I feel," Ender put his arm around her shoulder, and pulled her up against his side. He wasn't wearing his trenchcoat, instead opting for a simple black t-shirt. The nape of Natalie's neck tingled where his bare arm brushed up against her.<br><br>"Listen, don't worry about it. I'm with you right now, so everything's perfect."<br><br>"I told you that you shouldn't read my mind unless I tell you to, Ender…" Natale sighed looking down at the glassy Whelkshore coast.<br><br>"I didn't <i>have</i> to read your mind to know what you were thinking just then," He responded, giving her shoulder a light squeeze.<br><br>"Yeah, of course…" Natalie threw a rather terse elbow into Ender's ribs.<br><br>"Hey, that tickled," Ender chuckled quietly.<br><br>"That's it, next time I'm gonna just boot you off the cliff."<br><br>"Sounds like fun."<br>-------<br>Ender simply shrugged meekly, and put his glasses back on. He gave a regret laden smile, and then turned away. The bushes rustled slightly, and then he was gone again.<br><br>"…fuck."<br><br>Natalie turned to look to her teammates. It seemed they hadn't seen him for whatever reason, but that was child's play for Ender.<br><br>She reached into her pocket, and produced her phone. It was solid black and angular, one of those numbers that was supposed to survive being run over by a tank. This was her fifth one so far.<br><br>She flipped it open, and tapped the number 4. A moment later, the speed dial kicked in, and the line at Sly's home began ringing. She held it to her ear, and began tapping her foot impatiently. This was possibly the most important thing that had happened to them in years… It'd be ignorant for her not to let the others know.<br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler1948567').toggle();if($('#spoiler1948567').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler1948567">OOC: Not worth the wait really, but hey, we're live again.</div></div></div>

He grabbed tightly to the rope he’d anchored on the opposite bank and leaned forward.

He's wearing sunglasses despite the fact that they are in an indoor range. She's itching to shoot him, though, and see his blood spill all over the concrete--<br><br>"Hey now, rude."<br><br>"What?"<br><br>"Alright! Got a word out of you. Don't shoot me. That's way rude."<br><br>"Did you... did you read my mind?"<br><br>"Yeah, I did. Sorry, it happens. I go by Ender, but my real name's Andrew. I think I like Ender more, though. Should I call you something other than Shapeshift?"<br><br>"Don't you know my real name, mind reader?"<br><br>"Yeah, but it's only polite to ask."<br><br>"Rie."<br><br>"Cool. Rie. So I guess you've already done basic stances and stuff--"<br><br>Rie can feel a slight tingling in the back of her mind. "Stop reading my mind."<br><br>Ender blushes. "Er, sorry. But yeah, you've already done the boring stuff, so let's do something fun with those killer instincts you got. Let's practice a quick draw."<br><br>With that, Ender pulls a revolver from the holster at his side, cocks the hammer back, and pulls the trigger in one smooth motion. Rie looks down range and sees a bullet hole cut dead center on the target.<br><br>Rie raises an eyebrow. "Cool."</i><br><br><hr><br><br>Dark clouds began to materialize out of the previously clear sunset sky. Flashes of lightning arced through the roiling shapes, but save for Harmony's constant song, the world stayed silent.<br><br>Harmony looked up as a drop of water landed on her shaved head. She smiled then looked directly at Rie. <i>&lt;See you again soon, Sister.&gt;</i><br><br>Rie raised her still smoking rifle but before she could pull the trigger, Harmony disappeared in a flash of blue psionic light. Her meandering hum continued to float through everyone's head.<br><br>Rie popped the magazine out of her rifle and pulled a handful of rounds from her belt. She scanned the mechanically corrupted bodies laying about the square and the pile of dust that used to be Sandstorm at her feet. This was getting messier and messier. Ender, Harmony, Sandstorm, Gen 5s... The girl broke from her reverie as sunlight burst through the clouds about half a kilometer out. The clouds were clearly circling that point. What the hell was going on here?<br><br>Rie pushed the last 5.56mm round into the magazine then slammed the unit back into her rifle. In one quick motion she flicked both the bolt lock and safety off, her weapon's bolt loudly declaring that it was ready. "Let's go."<br><br><hr><br><br>Rain was coming down heavily under the mute skies. The clouds were swirling violently and soundless lightning arced every few seconds, but the wind had not picked up. Rie might have shivered if she wasn't exclusively focused on jogging and watching for movement.<br><br>The side street the group was running down opened up to a wide boulevard several meters ahead, and Rie came to a full stop before entering the intersection. The girl pressed herself against the corner of a nearby apartment building. The girl pulled up her mental map: the boulevard ran north-south, so as long as they hugged the western side, they could advance without Catch getting a clear shot.<br><br>Rie held her rifle up to her shoulder then quickly stepped out into the boulevard, scanning for targets. A moment later, she stopped scanning and stared. The boulevard ended at a park located directly beneath the eye of the storm. Pure sunlight illuminated a gigantic apple tree and a large crowd of shuffling individuals. The tree's branches seemed to actively grow upward and outward.<br><br>A figure in white stood on a thick branch several dozen meters above the ground. Even with her enhanced vision, Rie could only make out a flowing white gown, upright posture, and golden hair, but even with such vague details, something seemed familiar. Rie raised her rifle to look through its scope and zoomed in on the person.<br><br><i>Shapeshift, age 13, lay on a cold metal table, fighting the spreading numbness and encroaching darkness from the cocktail of drugs being pumped into her arm via IV. She's naked, and paralyzed, and shivering, and crying, but at least she isn't sobbing. Her only other defiance is willing her eyelids open as long as possible while someone brusquely runs a buzzing razor over her scalp again. A woman with golden blond hair--no, her hair is actually gold--walks up beside Shapeshift. Her cherry lips move, and it takes Shapeshift a while to comprehend, "Don't worry, little one, you won't feel anything soon," before finally drifting drifting into black anesthetic sleep.</i><br><br>Rie took her eye from the scope, blinked some of the rain from her eyes and looked again. The woman in her scope had the same golden hair and bright red lips but looked no older than 18. The operation to install the phasing implant happened more than nine years ago. This should be impossible. For a moment, the assassin's desire for answers almost stopped her from killing the scientist right then and there. Then the moment passed, and Rie pulled the trigger.<br><br>Click.<br><br>Rie almost pulled her head back in surprise but kept calm, pulled the charging handle back to expel the dud, took aim once more, and pulled the trigger.<br><br>Click.<br><br>Through her scope, Rie saw the woman smile sweetly then look directly down the boulevard at the assassin. Rie pulled the charging handle back and tried to fire again and got the same lack of reaction from her gun. The woman raised a hand toward Rie and gestured for her to come closer, then made a sweeping motion toward the gathered crowd. Suddenly, Harmony's melodic, meandering hum changed to a sharp, staccato whistle. The milling crowds momentarily stood still, then all as one began running toward the tree and attempting to clamber up like swarming insects. Though none actively fought any other, the chaos caused many to lose grip and fall.<br><br><i>&lt;Come on over, Sister. I promise we only want to talk with you, not kill you.&gt;</i> It was Harmony again with her sing song voice projected directly into Rie's mind.<br><br>Rie lowered the rifle. Rie focused her thoughts, knowing Harmony would be reading them. <i>Then what are you doing with all those civilians?</i><br><br><i>&lt;We are just giving them greater purpose. Don't concern yourself with them. Like I said, we only want to talk.&gt;<br><br>We're talking right now.<br><br>&lt;No, you're thinking loudly, and I'm manipulating your surface thoughts. Honestly, this is all very awkward for me, and I can tell you hate it. Well, you hate me, but you also hate what I’m doing to your mind, and, oh--. Sorry, I don't mean to pry. But come on. You’ll be safe. You know I've never lied to you, and you know out of all the other kids, I was the least untrustworthy. Well, not counting Diamante, but he was dumb as a brick, not honest.&gt;<br><br>Ender thought you were fine, not me.</i> Rie squeezed the grip of her rifle. <i>I just wanted to kill all of you, if I'm remembering right.<br><br>&lt;Close enough, no?&gt;<br><br>Fine.</i> Rie eyed the people behind her. <i>And my companions?<br><br>&lt;Ha! You almost thought 'friends.'&gt;<br><br>Shut up and answer the question.<br><br>&lt;I can't speak for Ysane or any of the others, but I promise I won't be actively hurt them.&gt;<br><br>Good enough.</i> "Alright everyone, let's get to that tree and get some answers. Harmony pretty much said that a bunch of other people are gonna try to kill you all so keep your guard up, I guess."<br><br>Rie led the way down the boulevard. She didn't bother raising her rifle to her shoulder again. None of the other Experiments, to her knowledge, could cause her gun to fail three times in a row. Ender could've, but Harmony didn't have that kind of precision skill, and Rie knew for a fact that those were the only two psionics alive when she ran away. Either Ender was fucking with her--not a crazy thought if he was really on their side like Sandstorm said--or it was that golden haired woman. The one Harmony called "Ysane." Rie didn't like either option.<br><br>As the group got closer to the park, the branch on which the woman stood stretched further out then snaked its way down to the ground. The woman in white gracefully stepped off and strode toward Rie, arms spread as if to greet her. Rie's fears were confirmed as the woman pulled the girl into an embrace, and even more alarmingly, when Rie's body became translucent, she still could not escape. A dove perched on the tree watched intently as the woman placed a kiss on both of Rie's cheeks.<br><br>"My little Shapeshift. How long it's been... and you've grown so much since we last saw one another!"<br><br>"Who are you and what do you want from me?" Rie asked.<br><br>The woman took a step back with a hand over her chest, her face a mixture of disbelief and offense. "Shapeshift! You don't remember your dear old Ysane?"<br><br>"I don't remember, and my name is Rie. The rest of the kids might have forgotten their names, but I still remember mine. The important things."<br><br>Ysane broke into laughter at that. "Such a joker as always. Even after we put that in you." Ysane tapped her index finger on Rie's forehead.<br><br>Rie immediately swatted away Ysane's hand. "So it really was you at the operating table." Her eyes narrowed. "I'm being serious. Who are you and what do you want?"<br><br>Ysane pouted. The pout turned into a frown, then a sigh, then a shake of the head. "Hmm... How unfortunate. Very well. If you truly don't remember, I am Ysane Tranquility, daughter of Eris, she of most beautiful chaos, discord, and strife. Indeed I was with you and all your brothers and sisters as I gave Genlab its inspiration and guidance. The researchers called me director, but to you and your siblings, I always felt like more of a mother."<br><br>Ysane smiled. Regardless of intention, Rie took the expression as mockery. She felt her jaw tighten. "Then you're the reason I'm like this. Why we're all like this."<br><br>"Yes! And the way you all turned out; it's wonderful, isn't it?"<br><br>"Fuck you." With that, Rie bumrushed the goddess. Ysane's eyes widened in surprise, but before Rie could actually make contact, she found herself exhaling sharply and falling backward as something sprang from the ground and drove into her diaphragm. What little air remained in Rie's lungs was expelled as the girl landed flat on her back despite instinctively phasing. Someone was anchoring her to the physical plane.<br><br>"Hello, Shapeshift," came an easy male voice from on top of Rie. When the double shock of being taken down wore off, Rie's vision came back into focus to find a lanky guy about her age with a black buzz cut pinning her down.<br><br>"Amorph," Rie said. She immediately headbutted him in the mouth. The attack barely made contact, but was enough to make Amorph phase, and Rie did as well to fall through the ground. A few seconds later, she rose back up several feet back.<br><br>"Oh, good one, <i>friend</i>," Amorph laughed as he stood up. He spat a bit of red and wiped his split lip with a sleeve. For a moment, the sleeve turned translucent and the blood fell from the fabric as if they had always been droplets in the air. Amorph grinned, his lip visibly knitting itself up to stop the bleeding. "Y'know, I really <i>missed</i> our little sparring sessions. So glad to have you <i>back</i>."<br><br>"Back? I'm not back for shit. This is a hunt, not a reunion," Rie said. She wiped a wet strand of hair from her face.<br><br>"Isn't it, though?" A new voice. Rie snapped her head in the voice's direction to see a man with combed back, bright red hair nonchalantly walking toward the group. His forearms would have been bare if not for the lengths of chain wrapped around each. "The prodigal sons have returned, and the missing daughter happens to also show up. That sounds like a reunion to me."<br><br>A wealth of memories flitted through Rie's mind at the sight of Cobra. Ender's old rival, all the moments of bad blood between them, and by proxy, with her. Those memories all stood second to one word that he had said. "Prodigal... sons?"<br><br>Cobra snorted. "Yeah, 'sons.' There's me--"<br><br>"--And there's me." Another new voice, but one Rie knew like the back of her hand.<br><br>Rie turned to face him. "Ender..."<br><br>The psionic adjusted his shades and flashed his yearbook smile. The smile shattered for a moment as it erupted into crackles of psionic energy. Not a second later did the blue lightning coalesce back into Ender's grin. "Yep, that's me. Hey for the second time today."<br><br>"Hey--" Rie shook her head. "What the hell is all this?"<br><br>"Heh, yeah. Apparently this whole thing," Ender raised his hand and suddenly caught a ball of blue energy then touched it to his forehead, absorbing it, "was to get the gang back together.<br><br>Rie furrowed her brow and looked to where the ball of presumably psionic energy came from. Behind Ender and near a man who had fallen from the tree was Harmony with a bored look on her face. The man at her feet was gasping for breath and his legs didn't move. Harmony laid a single index finger on his forehead. Blue light oozed from the man's head and dripped up Harmony's finger, then the man became still. The singer formed the energy into a ball and threw it at Ender who again caught it and absorbed it.<br><br>Rie stormed up to Ender and shoved him the chest. Psionic energy exploded outward, singeing Rie's hand and sending her stumbling back. The girl managed to stay on her feet as Ender's trenchcoat flickered back into shape. "What the FUCK, Ender?!?"<br><br>"Sorry, didn't mean to blast you like that."<br><br>"I don't give a shit about that. I mean you're supposed to be dead. I was at your fucking funeral. I actually cried and everything."<br><br>"Heh, I would've paid to--"<br><br>"Fuck you. I tried to kill myself. Then two years later, I find you hanging out with these bastards harvesting civilians for fucking what?"<br><br>"Shapeshift," Ysane said. Rie snapped a glare in her direction and opened her mouth, but Ysane cut her off. "Rie. We're here to bring Ender back. The cost to bring back life is high, but family? That's easily worth the price."<br><br>"Family? The hell are you going on about now?"<br><br>"Yes, family. This is why I guided you and Cobra here. This is why I brought Ender back, and why we're using those unworthy of the Tree to put him back together. Family." Ysane smiled. She took a few steps toward the tree as its branches continued to grow overhead. Ysane swirled a finger and a bright red apple fell from the branch and landed neatly in the goddess' hand. She took a bite. "The past two years have been lonely, have they not? Farther back than just two years, yes? After you ran away and found Ender, something was still missing within you. Am I wrong?"<br><br>"I..." Rie stared at Ysane. Something felt wrong... but the goddess' words were right. Despite running away from Genlab, Rie still acted like one of them. A weapon, sold to the highest bidder. She had told herself it was to pay the rent, to buy more guns, to pass the time. Something she could do on her own, not something she <i>had</i> to do. Her head was starting to swim. As if there was something crawling behind the front of her skull.<br><br>Rie recognized that feeling. She shot a look at Harmony.<br><br><i>&lt;I'm not the one working your head right now, Sister.&gt;</i><br><br>What? Harmony still had the bored look on her face, but she was sitting on a park bench now instead of looking for another life. That was definitely her melodic voice. Was this some kind of trick?<br><br>Rie looked at Ender. It couldn't be him, could it? <i>Ender, is that you?</i> The psionic had no reaction to the focused thought. Either he was in her head and being an asshole, or it was someone else. Even still, the Ender that Rie knew would have at least sent her a message. Maybe send some images to help explain what was going on, or at least give a mental pat on the back, or anything. Rie was far from a raging inferno, but as an empath, her friend would know that even the slightest uptick in emotions stuck out like a sore thumb.<br><br><i>&lt;I know you hate me for sticking with Genlab, but whatever you may think, I do care about all my siblings. I was thinking "what's a little manipulation between friends?" but this is hurting you much more than I thought it would.&gt;</i> Harmony said.<br><br><i>Harmony...<br><br>&lt;I'm also not the one telling you this. I'm still with Ysane. I believe in her vision for a peaceful, yet progressive world, built for the best and the brightest. Paradise for us Powers, especially. We are better than the people struggling in this town, and the same is true around the world. I know you believe in your strength, and I think deep down you believe in our goal, but you've been hurt enough today, so I'm going to flat out tell you: Ender's still dead.&gt;<br><br>Harmony, I will cut out your vocal chords and stab you in the auditory cortex if you're trying to mess with me more than you all already have.</i> Rie shifted her eyes back toward Ender. <i>Ender, I'm going to put a fucking bullet in your mouth if you don't talk to me right now. I know you heard Harms.</i><br><br>No answer. Harmony's mental whistle and the pressure in the back of Rie's mind continued. The girl tried to ignore that tingling, and focused on an image of her raising her pistol and shooting Ender. Still no reaction from her "friend." So she went through with the action.<br><br>In one smooth motion, Rie pulled a pistol from the holster at her side, cocked the hammer back, and pulled the trigger. Ender's head snapped back and exploded in crackles of white lightning and red flames. The boy took a step back but remained on his feet. After a moment, he straightened his posture, but his head was still a ring of fire.<br><br>"Shapeshift!" Ysane said. "I can't believe you did that!"<br><br>"That's not really him, is it."<br><br>Ysane pressed her lips together. "No, it's not. To me, Insanity."<br><br>Suddenly, what Rie thought was Ender erupted into flames. A white dove flew from the pyre and landed on Ysane's shoulder. When the smoke cleared moments later, nothing was left standing.<br><br>"Stop. Fucking. With. My. Life." Rie pointed her pistol at the goddess, even though she knew it would probably fire duds again. At least it felt good.<br><br>"I'm not 'fucking with' anything, Shapeshift," Ysane said. "I'm just trying to show you the way back home."<br><br>"I don't want to go 'home.' At least, not the place all you bastards call home."<br><br>"Is that how you talk to your family?"<br><br>"You're not my fucking family!" Rie snarled.<br><br>"Shapeshift--"<br><br>"And that's still not my name."<br><br>Ysane sighed and rolled her eyes. "Okay, Rie. I'll call you that for now, even if it doesn't fit you, just like the life you're trying to live right now. You're a hand trying to call a pocket a glove. What a waste of potential! You should see the way you're moving right now, the way your eyes flare like falling stars. These few hours we've had together has felt better and has been more interesting than your past few years, have they not? Yes, this Ender was not fully with us, but the doors of death are not so hard to open for a goddess. We didn't get him today, but we can in the future."<br><br>Rie shook her head. She had a point. Being a gun for hire really wasn't the best use of her time. And to have Ender back... Rie felt that fuzz of confusion in the back of her head again.<br><br><i>&lt;She's lying...&gt;</i> Harmony sang.<br><br>Rie snapped back to attention and shoved the fog out of her head. "I don't believe you. I don't believe any of you. I don't want any of you, and I think I'd be best off with all of you dead." Rie straightened her pistol's aim and pulled the trigger. Click. Another dud.<br><br>"Tsk tsk," Ysane said. "I tried doing this the best way for you, but it looks like you'll need some time."<br><br>"I don't want 'some time.' I want you all gone forever."<br><br>"Oh, don't misunderstand me. I didn't mean time away from us, I meant time with us. Amorph, Cobra, Insanity, take Rie. Kill her friends." Ysane turned to the apple tree. "All of you who are ready, kill them, too."<br><br>One of the first civilians had reached a glowing portal near the top of the tree. She stepped through. There was a blood curdling scream that pierced the silent air, then ten heartbeats later, the portal evaporated into mist, leaving behind a biomechanical monstrosity. The newly created gen 5 best leapt from the canopy and landed heavily on pavement. More flashes of light and more screams followed, then dozens more came soaring down.<br><br>Rie holstered her pistol and pulled out her rifle. She expelled the last dud, flicked it into burst fire mode, and immediately put three bullets in the first beast's chest followed by three more in the head, dropping it. So the duds only happened for Ysane. She turned toward another beast and tapped it three times in the chest. She shifted her aim toward its head but before she could pull the trigger, something moved at the edge of her vision. The girl shifted her weight just as a shortsword thrust through the space where her kidney had just been. Amorph held the sword with an arm that seemed to stretch like rubber. Rie aimed her rifle, ducked under Amorph's backswing, and pulled the trigger. The three bullets passed through Amorphs translucent chest as if he were not there.<br><br>"C'mon, Shapeshift. You know the rules of this match." Amorph laughed as his arm retracted to normal length. He pulled another sword from his belt with his other hand and flourished the blades. Runes glowed down their lengths.<br><br>Rie groaned, then unslung her rifle and dropped it. The assassin pulled a combat knife from the small of her back. It did not glow in any way.<br><br>Amorph laughed again, then moved to an offensive stance. His body was translucent, while Rie didn't bother. Rain continued to drench the two as they stood in their own silence.<br><br>Amorph's leading hand twitched slightly then lashed out like a snake again. Rie sidestepped, the sword arm whipping by her shoulder. Amorph overshot, and the girl waved her off hand through her opponent's translucent arm. She phased for a millisecond, feeling her hand tingle as it interacted with Amorph, then shifted her whole body to match his plane and stabbed him on the inside of his elbow. She concentrated on the embedded knife, using the point of contact to keep Amorph from phasing out. The girl then dragged the knife up, carving a bloody gash through her opponent's tendons and veins, then released the anchor and phased once more to let the ghostly outpouring of blood pass through her.<br><br>Rie's head was tingling, but not at a psychic's touch. Her phasing implant had gone into overdrive to interfere with Amorph's more advanced implant. While the devices were based on the same technology, Rie's had been the first successful prototype. She shuffled a few steps back to make some space while her implant cooled off. At least she had managed to disarm Amorph with that attack. He was still grinning despite his empty hand and open veins. "You know it's been years since I've bled like this? Years!"<br><br>"I forgot how annoying you were. On purpose," Rie said.<br><br>Amorph just shrugged. His arm had regenerated already. He gave his hand a shake then pulled another runed sword from his back. Amorph closed his eyes and grunted. Both his arms made sloppy breaking sounds as they cleanly split in half. Blood didn't spill, and each half quickly healed into a total of four whole arms. One pulled the remaining sword from Amorph's belt. The other stretched out toward the previously dropped sword.<br><br>Rie quickly drew a pistol to shoot the fallen sword away, but then Amorph charged. Rie muttered a curse then raised her knife and pistol and shifted her weight into a wide, defensive stance.<br><br>Amorph slashed high and low with both his right arms as his elongated left arm snatched up his last sword. Rie stepped into the attack and toward her opponent's outside shoulder. She ducked the high attack and caught the low attack with her knife's guard, guiding it into the ground. The girl shifted her weight again and dropped a shoulder, barreling through the translucent man. Once she was clear, she phased to match and shot Amorph in the back three times. The fourth passed through him without leaving a bloody hole.<br><br>Rie stepped back as Amorph drove one of his blades backward. She ducked the next two high slashes that Amorph performed as he whipped around to face Rie again. He made a fourth cut low. Rie picked up her leg to dodge. She then swept her foot through Amorph's attacking forearm to get another feel, set her feet, then sprang into the air to dodge the backswing.<br><br>Rie lashed out with her knife hand using the same trick Amorph had done several times before, her arm lengthening so that she could stab him behind the collarbone. She used the knife as an anchor and pivoted midair to pull herself onto Amorph's shoulders, locking his chin behind her calves. If memory served, his implant would be behind a runed metal plate right... here. Rie pressed her pistol to her bucking ride and managed to get two shots off. She would have fired a third time if something hadn't grabbed her hair from behind and ripped her from her perch. She couldn't phase and got slammed down head first into the mud. The pressure released so Rie picked a side and rolled. She heard Amorph land heavily around where her spine had just been.<br><br>Rie maneuvered her legs so that her sideways roll ended with her in a three point stance. Amorph had one knee deep in the ground a few steps away, and Rie's knife still stuck out from his shoulder. His right foot was transforming from a hand back to a foot. He turned to her, still grinning. "I missed having an opponent this slippery."<br><br>"I don't."<br><br>"Yeah, well look how rusty you've gotten," Amorph laughed. "Bet your implant is warm as fuck right now."<br><br>Rie just glared. He was right about one thing; she was pushing her implant hard. Amorph's tech must have gotten an upgrade as it took more effort to keep him anchored than Rie remembered. Or maybe he was right about being rusty... Rie mentally shook her head. No, definitely not.<br><br>Rie holstered her pistol and pulled another combat knife from her boot before standing up. The rain was causing some mud from the girl's brow to leak into her eye, but she didn't dare take her eyes off her opponent to wipe it off. More specifically, she eyed each of Amorph's runed swords. If she could grab one of those, she'd at least have a weapon that could hit him without having to constantly match his phases.<br><br>Amorph shifted his bare feet to a wider stance then lashed out at Rie with all four arms simultaneously. Rie dodged and slipped her way around the first round of attacks, trying her best to keep all blades in her vision. She vaulted over a second attack, ducked a third, and used her knife to push away a fourth. Amorph's unrelenting attacks kept coming, and Rie continued to dance through them, waiting for her opening.<br><br>There. Amorph thrust one his swords at Rie. The girl took a calculated step to the side to dodge then used her off hand to grab the sword's blade. She felt the metal biting into her fingers just as she felt Amorph's current phasing frequency. The girl phased to match and jammed her knife into the inside of Amorph's forearm, let go of the knife, then gave a hard slap to her opponent's wrist. With temporarily severed tendons and nerves, Amorph's hand slackened enough for Rie to wrench the sword out. Once she had it, she quickly backpedaled to put some space between her and her opponent.<br><br>Rie took the sword in her good hand and worked the fingers of her off hand. The cut wasn't deep, but the wound certainly wouldn't help. On top of the wound, the sword was lighter and shorter than the one she kept at home--the one she'd trained with. Oh well. She would have to make do.<br><br>"Ha, ok, that was pretty good," Amorph said. He retracted his arms and took a look at the knife embedded in his wrist. He passed one of his swords to that hand then used the newly freed hand to arm to rip the knife out and throw it away. He winked. "Well I guess now that you've gotten one of my bad boys, it's time to get serious with this fight."<br><br>Amorph rushed forward and came in with an overhead cut. Rie slapped it away with her new sword and dodged the next slash. The girl stepped forward holding her sword high and point forward, intercepting another attack. She let the force of the blow flow into her wrist and pulled the momentum to swing the sword in an overhead circle toward Amorph's exposed neck.<br><br>Then he flashed vantablack and the sword passed through without taking his head off.<br><br>"F--" Rie was interrupted by a pommel slamming into her chin and another into her gut. The girl stumbled back and barely managed to get her blade up to stop the flat of Amorph's third sword from hitting her in the head.<br><br>"You like the new upgrade, Shapeshift?" Amorph asked. His words oozed mockery.<br><br>"Meh," Rie grunted through clenched teeth.<br><br>"Oh poor baby." Amorph sheathed one of his swords so he could use a fist to mock crying. He puffed his lower lip dramatically. "C'mon, Shapeshift, don't give up on me now. I'm only starting to really have fun."<br><br>Rie just held her sword between herself and her opponent. She needed to end this sooner rather than later. She stole a glance at her companions. Prime, Yoshimitsu, and Sly were busy dealing with more and more Gen 5s. Insanity had transformed into a two story tall hellhound and was in an even tussle with Valon. Natalie was practically frothing at the mouth as she dealt with Cobra, though in her rage it looked like she had the upper hand.<br><br>Rie snapped back to Amorph as the man came charging in once more. She quickly pulled a knife from her other boot and held it up as a guard. The two became a storming clash of metal once more. The blocks and parries were easier with only three points of attack to watch out for, but Rie was still on the defensive. Despite being down a sword, Amorph was presenting fewer openings after his attacks. Was he just playing with her earlier? Rie gritted her teeth at the thought as she dodged another series of attacks. Bastard.<br><br>Rie parried a low slash and spun her sword into a quick riposte, but Amorph easily slapped away the counter. "That's really the best you can do?"<br><br>"Shut up." Rie sidestepped a high thrust.<br><br>"Poor little rusty Shapeshift." Amorph flickered black as Rie's blade passed through his chest. "Ysane's right about all that wasted potential."<br><br>"Shut up."<br><br>"Or what?" Amorph caught Rie's next attack and flashed black, phasing the sword's together. He became physical again and spun his sword, ripping Rie's weapon out of her hands. Amorph's follow up came like lightning, thrusting another sword into Rie's gut, plunging the blade down to the guard. She would have gasped if not for the searing pain.<br><br>"Yeah, that's what I thought." Amorph let go of the sword and pushed Rie away from him. She stumbled back but managed to keep her footing. "After all these years, I can put you down just like that. But of course I didn't, because I'm a gentleman."<br><br>Rie focused as best she could to do an internal assessment. Amorph was still playing with her. Darkness crept at the edges of the girl's vision, but she wasn't going into shock. That was good. Somewhat. She was getting lightheaded, but she still standing, so probably no major arteries hit. Internal bleeding, though, maybe ten minutes of consciousness left. Bastard. Rie suddenly noticed that her blood soaked hands were shaking as they clutched the sword hilt. She made an attempt to pull the sword out and ended up yelling in pain and coughing up more blood. The taste of iron felt like an oil slick on her tongue.<br><br>Amorph laughed. "Yeah keep trying, bud. Cut your intestines to ribbons. Doesn't matter. We can patch that up when we get home, <i>friend</i>. Just like old times."<br><br>Rie gripped the sword and started pulling again, screaming. She stopped to catch her breath when she heard another yell. Her glare at Amorph shifted to the fight between Natalie and Cobra several dozen meters away. Nat, bruised and bloody, had her whip-like sword curled around Cobra's neck. The green haired woman vaulted over the red haired man and flipped, causing the coil to tighten. Blood came in drops then spurts then geysers as Cobra's head came off. Nat spat on the body and kicked the head at a circling Gen 5.<br><br>"Well, that sucks," Amorph said. His smile had momentarily disappeared as he also watched the end of the fight.<br><br>Rie felt a surge within herself. The fuckers here weren't immortal. They were the same kids she had the misfortune of growing up with. She yelled again and ripped the sword from her gut, then charged before Amorph could fully turn his attention back. He made a quick, reactionary slash at the girl's torso, but Rie ducked it and dropped low, sweeping her foot forward. She passed through Amorph's left calf unimpeded, phased to match, then gave the inside of Amorph's right ankle a bone breaking hit. As Amorph fell backward, Rie leapt forward and drove her sword through Amorph's stomach, riding him to the ground. The sword stabbed into the ground on impact, pinning the man for the moment.<br><br>"Oh, matching stomach wounds. How cute." Amorph's grin was back.<br><br>"I told you to shut up."<br><br>Rie straddled Amorph's chest, ripped her old knife from his shoulder and shoved it into the base of his chin, throwing his head back and pressing it to the mud. She unholstered a pistol and pressed it against his temple and emptied the entire magazine. "I'm not missing this time."<br><br><i>&lt;Sorry, Sister, neither is Catch.&gt;</i><br><br>Rie's eyes went wide as she noticed two things: something was itching at the back of her mind again, and her fight with Amorph had brought her to a place with no tall buildings to the west. She would have noticed that Harmony had started singing a requiem if not for the cloud of pink mist exploding from two newly made holes in her head.</div></div>
