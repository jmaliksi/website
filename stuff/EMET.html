        <div class="content"><div class="message">The floor jingled with every step, the tiles illuminating beneath the clicking shoes of a showily dressed young man. He adjusted his silk shirt, a gleam of light from above catching on it.<br><br>"Hmmm..." He looked down, examining the branching embroidery spreading from around the collar, making sure it was perfectly crisp and straight. As a high level operative of the Fascere Order, his appearance was vital. Doubly so when he was going to be meeting with both his boss and a very high value repeat customer within the next hour.<br><br>A familiar voice emerged in his mind, subtley, but still noticable. Wait-- No. Not one voice, two. Then one again. He put a finger to his temple, massaging it slightly. The voices lead to his right.<br><br>He turned to face the door, and knocked with a harsh rapping. Having heard no objections, the man opened the door, and stepped into the room, taking care to close it behind him. The enchanted tiles jingled one last time, and then fell silent.<br><br>The room was incredibly pedestrian, compared to the heavily magicked hallway that he had just stepped out of. Some kind of unmarred hardwood floor and the crisp white paint on the walls gave the impression of a newly constructed home. The only furnishing present was a cafeteria-style table, with benches built into it. And, presently sitting on one of the benches, while folding a shirt similar to the one he was wearing, was a dashing young gentleman.<br><br>"Hey Terrian. Good news," Nopcsa paused, waiting for his comrade to set the shirt atop an identical pile.<br><br>"We've got a juicy job offer."<br><br>OOC: Nopcsa and Terrian for a few rounds. I'll let you guys know when the plot opens up.</div></div>

        <h2 class="poster">Beelzebibble</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">The young man stepped forward, took his crimson shirt off (with difficulty; he was trying to move his left arm as little as possible), handed it without comment to the identical young man standing where he had been, and stepped back into position. Alone again, he folded the shirt and dropped it off onto the pile before stepping forward to begin the process all over. He hadn't known whether to stifle a chuckle or a shudder when the Fascere Order had issued him this shirt, but of course it wasn't for him. Or rather, <i>they</i> weren't for him, as he was churning out quite a lot of them. His instructions were to produce "either a thousand or enough to hit the ceiling, whichever comes first." After having lost count too many times to hope for the first goal, he was now trying gamely for the second.<br><br>It was too hard for him to keep his mind on the mounting numbers. It was too hard to keep his mind on anything.<br><br>That morning a duplicate overseas had broken his arm in a fight. And, of course, that pain had been given to Terrian to feel instead of the duplicate. He could have resolved it in an instant by recalling the duplicate to him -- erasing the wound and, consequently, the pain -- but he needed the duplicate where he was and it would be not be a low-profile move for the duplicate to return after having apparently vaporized in a hospital bed. This was a poor enough blow as it was but these things never seemed to be isolated incidents for Terrian Brogue. One great stroke of bad luck opened up a wide swathe of lesser ones. Over the course of this long gray day he'd been grieved by the sensation of cuts, bruises and sores all over his body, the effects of various mishaps occurring to a couple dozen identical young men scattered across the world.<br><br>So it was no easy feat to concentrate on counting to a thousand, or anything else, including the question of why the Fascere Order needed so many of these shirts. The instructions had come with a stringent warning, "DO NOT allow this fabric to come into contact with liquid nitrogen." As if he'd been carrying some along in a thermos. His curiousity had been snuffed out about forty minutes ago. Right now he was only collected enough to observe dully that it was a good thing the shirts couldn't come into contact with dust, as there was certainly enough in the bare room to keep Terrian's eyes nice and red.<br><br>He looked up as Nopcsa entered and made his announcement. He would have liked to respond some kind of clever inquiry, but a duplicate in Colorado had reported fairly needlessly that he had lost a tooth to an ill-aimed pair of skis and since then, though Terrian's teeth still appeared intact, he hadn't felt much like talking. He was able to manage a clenched "That so?" and nothing more.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Ayup. Got a job running surveillance for one of our clients," Nopcsa took a rough glance at Terrian's mind, noting the dismal overcast, and then quickly pulled back out. Pain didn't really hurt, per se... But it was irritating. Like going to the dentist. When reading minds, he'd feel the spot where agony should be, but it was distant, beyond his senses.<br><br>"He was a bit of a nut the last time we sent him a parcel. Kept calling and double checking with our scrying department to ensure it'd get there in time. Almost flipped out when our operatives got sidetracked by some thugs-" Nopcsa shrugged.<br><br>"It was only a few gunmen though. Nothing too spectacular. Anywhose, I digress."<br><br>"So, he decided that he was impressed enough by that to want our best guys for surveillance to show, and it just so happened that a mindreader and a one man army fit the bill rather nicely."<br><br>"That's the situation. Basically, Auguste is <i>asking</i> for us to get our butts out of here, and spend a few nights watching a crazy guy's gigantic mansion. Fun for the whole family." The way that Nopcsa had stated that last statement made it clear. This was a totally mandatory assignment, and regardless of whatever clauses in Terrian's contract, the boss was pushing for him to head out to the front.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Beelzebibble</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">There was one key word here and Terrian settled on it quickly. It was not "gunmen", which might have given Terrian pause in his current state, and it was also not "scrying", the kind of word he tried to pay attention to when it came up in environments like these.<br><br>"<i>Mansion</i>," he got out. "Love it. Know what that means?" Terrian tossed one more red shirt onto the pile. "Pantries. Mini-bars. Wine cellars. Huh?" Terrian could see it already: a duplicate, surreptitiously dispatched to take a little look around, returning to the brave sentries with a bottle of vodka under each arm. He rubbed his eyes.<br><br>Then he took off the red shirt and, buttoning on his own white dress shirt, added, "Had enough of this anyway. Folding takes forever. Wait 'till--" Here he realized what he was about to say and quickly changed course with what he thought to be commendable presence of mind given the circumstances. "--they see how many I got through."<br><br>This was more prudent than finishing the sentence with "--I show Mr. Tylor what I've been practicing." Better to keep the cards close to his chest until he knew he could do it consistently. But since the Ulima Tournament, Terrian had been looking forward to the day when his principle contribution to the Fascere Order didn't involve so much folding. Or at least, maybe the folding of paper instead of fabric.<br><br>"When do we go?"</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Well, for the most part, not so much on the fine liquors. I'm sure he's got a few exquisite bottles of wine, but for the most part, this fellow is not the type to host parties," Nopcsa shrugged slightly.<br><br>"He's a collector of objects worth more than you or I make in ten years. And I'm guessing his schtick is ownership, not flaunting it."<br><br>"Gruntwork is as gruntwork does. I had to spend my first two months here pacing the building and listening for thoughts of employees, and secrets that we could capitalize on. It went pretty well, until I found out about a tryst between one employee and another employee's girlfriend... Needless to say, the guy with a cannon grafted onto his chest came out ahead, and I got moved to covering the other guy's duties-" Nopcsa paused, glancing at the pile of shirts again.<br><br>"You do realize that you're getting royalties on this, right?" Nopcsa picked one up, scanning it from edge to edge with a practiced gaze, and then folding it back up again.<br><br>"Not that these really are that great of a magical boon. Just some shirts that change color when one's in imminent danger..." He slipped it into his pocket, pushing at one corner that insisted on hanging out. <br><br>"Still, you're going to clean house on this one."<br><br>"We'll be going, as soon as you're ready, really. Just to the end of the hall, and then we teleport out of here. Somewhere in this guy's neighborhood."</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Beelzebibble</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Terrian noticed Nopcsa's gesture and, with appreciation for the other man's foresight, picked a shirt up as well. He tucked it meticulously into his pocket, taking care to replicate Nopcsa's failure to conceal the fabric completely. This seemed more convenient than frustrating to him.<br><br>"Don't care if they pay me," he said, perhaps a little recklessly. "My pleasure. Honestly. I'm ready to go. Too bad about the drinks."<br><br><br><i>OOC: Yes, even Terrian suffers when I'm too involved in excitedly working out my upcoming RP to actually RP well!</i></div></div>

        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Then, shall we be on our way?" Nopcsa turned, already knowing Terrian's response, and headed for the door. He started to close it behind him, but noticed Terrian stumping along. He stepped aside, and let his colleague past, before closing it with a slam.<br><br>"Really, it's a pretty cool place. Garden the size of a golf course, all fenced in and private. Apparently he gardens it himself, from what the Boss says. All kinds of exotic plants and stuff, and a great big koi pond. Will be a pain in the ass to keep eye over, but I'm sure that you can spare a dozen men to help, right?" Nopcsa glanced to the end of the hallway. It looked like a wall, but that was nothing more than a simple glamour. He reached out, and placed his hand on it.<br><br>"Stand back." Nopcsa groped around the wall for a while longer, patting it like he was looking for a missing contact lens. He began sliding his hands up and down, still failing to find it.<br><br>"I'm guessing that the sonsabitches changed the door on me..." He muttered, and slid his hand to the opposite side of the wall. His arm did a slight jolt, and then moved as if he was taking hold of something. There was the sound of a doorknob turning, and Nopcsa stepped back, seemingly tugging a door out of the featureless wall. He glanced back over his shoulder, veryifying that Terrian was the only other individual in the hallway, and then stepped through. He waited for Terrian once more, and then closed the door. It vanished into the room's wall, awaiting its next user.<br><br>"This is a bit of a company secret, if you will. We like to seem omnipresent, even if our numbers are markedly less." Nopcsa gestured towards the center of the room. Set down into the wooden floor, a jade disc about the size of a café table glimmered with unnatural light.<br><br>"It's a portal that drops you to whatever location Auguste pipes in from his desk. He primed it for us, and doesn't want to blow this job, so we'll be fine. But that's not to say that he hasn't set it to 'Marianas Trench' for some jackasses that were stealing the office supplies." Nopcsa patted the pocketed shirt, and winked. The color had remained the same shade of crimson as before.<br><br>"Geronimo!" Nopcsa stepped onto the disk, and seemingly fell straight into it.<br>--------<br>He landed on his hands and knees, in a back alley. It seemed fairly innocuous, with a few empty, dented trash cans towards the front. He could sense a few vague presences about, but none seemed to be observing the area at the moment. Bouncing back to his feet, he waited for Terrian to appear.<br><br>Nopcsa threw his hands out, and his head back, breathing deeply of the night air.<br><br>"Feels great to be in the contiguous forty eight again, doesn't it?" He exhaled deeply, and resumed normal posture. Once Terrian got his bearings, he strode out of the alleyway confidently.<br><br>"In this case, Salt Lake City. We're a block from our client, just around that corner up ahead. Welcome to Planet Mormon." The night was crip, somewhat cooler than it had been in Hawaii, but still warm. Streetlights cast a stark lumination over the city, with a few cars rolling past slowly. The mountains, faintly visible as dark hulks in the distance, seemed to watch the duo as they headed towards their mission.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Beelzebibble</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message"><i>OOC: SHIT SALT LAKE CITY SHIT SHIT. And here I thought this RP was kinda losing the horror angle and just turning into a really interesting RP. Man, you got me on that one, Lee. Salt Lake City gives me nightmares.</i><br><br>Terrian regarded the jade disk uneasily. He wasn't in a good state of being for falling through things. Maybe it led down onto a grassy turf, like the guy's front yard. Terrian stepped onto the plate. No. Cement. Terrian fell forward onto his hands, but it didn't feel like he had fallen a great distance.<br><br>Terrian looked up and down the tidy street, smiled, chuckled, and then gave forth a low laugh. "Salt Lake City," he said. "Can see why you didn't frontload <i>that</i> info. You know once I was hopping between the coasts on business and I had to overnight in Salt Lake City <i>eight times</i>? Swear to God. I came home saying 'Yeah... Golden plates! <i>Yeah</i>! It's brilliant!'"<br><br>He rubbed his jaw; the toothache seemed to be letting up somewhat, but it still hurt to do so much talking at once. He decided not to push his luck, and fell silent as they came to the corner and turned from one row of neat, dark houses onto another.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">OOC: Um. Um. I can probably get something in? Probably? If I try? Let me read back over everything and try to put something together.<br><br>[EDIT]: The answer is yes.<br><br><br><br>Somewhere in the mansion, a grandfather clock struck. Then another, and another, until the actual time was lost somewhere in the echoes through the cluttered chateau. Rhys looked up, made to check his watch, and remembered he'd left it in the room he was occupying for the time being.<br><br>His appearance here was due to delivery. Someone, somewhere in one of the myriad businesses and institutes with which he was affiliated (however loosely) was supposed to deliver a package of what he understood to be something important, rare, and expensive...and mundane, he supposed, if the number of people who must have dodged the job before it fell into his own lap could be taken as an indication. <br><br>But, not in a position to be fiscally selective, Rhys snatched up the job that had been touted as a "paid excursion" to some "remote and interesting locale." <br><br><i>Interesting locale.</i> Rhys snorted, an odd noise in the spacious but cluttered room in which he found himself. <i>Salt Lake City? Closer to a remote and interesting circle of Hell.</i> <br><br>The thought of which brought to mind the man whose house he was currently inhabiting. He had shown up the previous afternoon with his burden, a box of a size, shape, and weight vague enough to be just about anything imaginable, wrapped in plain brown shipping paper that made Rhys decide as soon as he recovered it at the airport that it was certainly nothing that warranted the flight out here to hand it over. He had stood out on the front stoop, box in hand, long enough to begin to feel uncomfortable, when the door creaked open, revealing a much shorter woman who he pegged immediately as the housekeeper type. She showed him in, explained to him that she was very sorry, that the master of the estate was elsewhere, that he should like to meet the bearer of his...whatever was in the box. <br><br>Rhys declined. His return flight left in the morning and if she could please extend his condolences and let him go check into a hotel, then perhaps that would be alright.<br><br>She insisted that he stay in one of the rooms on the estate. She offered him pay and reimbursement for his troubles.<br><br>Rhys accepted. <br><br>And he was beginning to wonder why. <br><br>The room he'd been shown to was somewhere down some corridor that he wasn't entirely sure he remembered how to get to; though roomy enough, it was stuffed with antique furniture of origins he couldn't quite imagine but that were old and exotic enough to make him wary of them. <br><br>Presently, he sat in a squat leather chair in one of many rooms he'd seen lined floor-to-ceiling with bookshelves, drinking something he'd brought with him, reading one of his own folded paperbacks. Rhys had heard one time that affluent people sometimes stocked a library with fake books, made to look like real ones, to line their libraries and appear erudite, well-read. He'd checked. Every book he'd opened was legitimate, most old enough and rare enough to discourage him from looking through them further.<br><br>In his seat, Rhys shifted, took a drink from his glass on the table next to him, flicked over a page in his book, sighed. For the next unspecified amount of time, he was being paid to lounge about in this huge, uncomfortable house. He only hoped that something would happen to make the experience more bearable.<br><br></div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Oh dear... Terrian, buddy, I sincerely hope that you're not tired of gold, because-" Nopcsa jerked his head to the side, indicating across the street. A large stucco wall that had been occupying the majority of the block cut into a gateway. Two collossal wrought iron gates stood at attention there, each meticulously painted over with gold paint. There was no driveway, not even a dip in the curb to admit cars.<br><br>Nopcsa nodded slightly to Terrian, and crossed the road without looking in either direction. As they got closer, they could see that three of the rooms in the house were lit, two on the upper floors, one at ground level. The mindreader continued walking, directly at the gate, and opened before him. Stepping slightly and keeping exact pace with its parting, Nopcsa entered the property.<br><br>"Like magic, right?" Nopcsa said with a broad grin.<br><br>"Like magic, indeed. It would be folly to expect anything less than that from the Fascere Order," The voice came from the shadows of the walls, quiet but still steadily spoken in a cultured tone. A young woman stepped out from the concealment, closing the panel to control the gates as she did so.<br><br>"Welcome to the estate of Master Giguere. We hope that you enjoy your stay, Nopcsa, Terrian." She bowed humbly, and then straightened up, "If you'd just follow me, I'll lead you to the room where his other employees are supposed to meet."<br><br>Nopcsa nodded briefly, and then waited for Terrian to catch up. With a wave of his hand, he gestured for Terrian to walk ahead of him. They walked briskly across the lawn, and up to the front entry of the mansion. The building was an impressive hulk of a home, easily the size of a supermarket or lesser mall. It, much like the front gates, had a similar render covering, but with elaborate designs etched into almost every inch. Towards the edges, it frayed into elegant gothic designs, but as it neared the center, above the doorway, they seemed to weave together into a very distinctive form.<br><br>Taking the shape of a noble dragon, leering down at the front step, it had two rounded windows in the place of eyes. The shadows of night seemed to cast a disapproving air to the beast's visage.<br><br>"It's quite a manor, once you become used to its eccentricities... He paid all manner of artisans from around the countryside to come in and help decorate, so as you'd assume, a considerable ammount of the furnishings have details and intricacies beyond the pale of what you'd see even in the finest museums," The woman produced a key with a luminous red gem set into it, and used it to unlock the door with a swift, practiced motion. Yet again, Nopcsa hung back, shooing Terrian along ahead of him.<br><br>The hallway they entered instantly illuminated itself. Fixtures, taking the form of antique lanterns despite the modern spirals of compact fluorescent bulbs obvious within them, lit the area with a soft, steady glow. The carpet was golden and thick, with elaborate designs spiralling and dancing about eachother. The walls themselves were fairly drab, a light shade of tan bordering on beige, but it seemed there was hardly space at head level for all of the paintings the man had accrued.<br><br>Each one seemed to have an obvious common theme, obviously betraying a bit of an obsession on the part of the owner. Dragons, dragons, and more dragons. Sometimes in flight, sometimes nesting, sometimes being slain, sometimes devouring unfortunate victims. At a glance back to the carpet, the patterns seemed sinous, almost like the coils of some manner of serpent.<br><br>The woman walked over to a small panel discretely set to the side, and began working with it to punch in a certain set of commands. Nopcsa stepped around Terrian, keeping himself distant from her. He placed a hand firmly on Terrian's shoulder, and leaned in close to his ear.<br><br>"I can't read her at all. You know, thoughts, that is. I don't know exactly what her deal is, but-"<br><br>"Would all people aiding in guarding the premises please report to the main dining room? I repeat, would all people aiding in the guarding of the premises please report to the main dining room?" The woman's voice came from all sides, just loud enough to be unpleasant, and echoing from seemingly every room in the building. She removed her finger from the intercom button, and moved back in front of the group. Nopcsa faded away from Terrian, still staying behind his teammate. In just a little bit, they'd be finding out who else was on the case with them.<br><br>OOC: There, gave an opening to all of you folk that haven't introduced yourselves yet. BB, if you don't show up soon, the plot train may move without you.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message"><i>Did</i> you <i>know there'd be other people on duty?</i> Terrian thought loudly, under some vaguely-defined assumption that Nopcsa would pick this up.<br><br>He looked over the paintings. Most of them he dismissed as pop art junk, but there was one old-looking Chinese paper work that he kept looking back at. A long, coiling form with black and white scales and flaming whiskers was descending against a sky patched with red and gray. The palette was so limited that Terrian supposed what had caught his attention were the two points of yellow, a color otherwise absent from the painting: the dragon's empty eyes.<br><br>Terrian clasped his hands behind his back, twisting fingers over thumbs, and looked away toward the reassuring triteness of the great bat-winged Western dragons with smoking nostrils and eyes ablaze.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">SV</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Rhys looked up, befuddled. The voice on the intercom was that of the woman who showed him in earlier this day, but he had no idea what she meant by people "involved with the guarding of the premises." He'd been in this house since early afternoon -- at least four hours, but probably closer to six -- and hadn't seen anyone, though more than once he thought he'd heard voices that he couldn't locate in the labyrinthine mansion, and he'd thought it better to ignore them as his imagination.<br><br>But people were people, and the more time he spent in this place the more uncomfortable he became. He vaguely remembered having passed through a dining room earlier in the day that he might be able to find his way back to. Besides, he wanted to find out what this "guarding" was about.<br><br>He stood, placing his book and drink on the table beside him. They would still be there when he got back.<br></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"You know, I have to say I didn't quite catch that- Your name, I mean, Miss-" Nopcsa said, bowing his head ever-so-slightly towards the guide.<br><br>"Ruth Mayor. Groundskeeper, greeter, and general attendant for Master Giguere," She stated with a calm professionalism, and began to walk past the Fascere operatives.<br><br>"Nopcsa, and Terrian Brogue. You already should know our afiliation," Nopcsa stepped up ahead of her, politely but firmly cutting off the rest of the hall from her path. Smiling subtley, he took hold of one of her hands, "Pleased to meet you."<br><br>He held on for a moment, and then let go. The hand he had taken hold of didn't feel right. It was dry and calloused, sturdy, with a lingering heat. Almost like shaking with a blacksmith still wearing his gloves. Compared to the appearance of fine, graceful fingers, it came as a shock.<br><br>"By the way, Ruth, if you'd like some help preparing the meal for tonight, I'd gladly help." Nopcsa sidestepped a table that projected unusually far into the hallway, carefully avoiding his shirt getting snagged on a statue of a rampaging dragon.<br><br>"Not that I'm good with main courses or anything, but if you could go and get the <i>masher</i> for me, I'd be able to whip up some ungodly mashed potatoes." Nopcsa turned, clearly nodding towards Terrian.<br><br>"Just get the masher ready, in case help's needed, y'know? I like cooking, after all."<br><br>OOC: Third time I've written this post, and by far the worst. Oh well. Anywho, one or two more rounds, and we come together.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Oh man, no way, Nopcsa, don't make your mashed potatoes. You know I need like six servings of those, and I'm still pretty full from lunch," Terrian said. He made a show of patting his chest to demonstrate this last point. To be honest he actually patted an area just above his chest and to the left. There was resistance from a metallic object within the inner pocket of his jacket where his hand came down.<br><br>"Well, all the same. Pleasure to make your etc., Ruth." Terrian grinned as he reached out to take her hand. Oh. He dropped eye contact with her for an instant. No, she <i>wasn't</i> wearing any gloves. He hadn't thought so. Strange.<br><br>To cover his surprise, he quickly added, "I really like your name, by the way. I've met too many weirdos with bizarre names lately. Like this guy. 'Nopcsa', what is that? Sounds like someone Horis and Thoth would have hung out with back in old country..."<br><br>He laughed and nudged Nopcsa's shoulder. This was all a special social maneuver, Terrian Brogue Tactic No. 5 or 6 or something. Show more ease and self-assurance than you actually felt. Not only did it put the target off-guard, but honestly, there <i>was</i> something psychologically empowering about acting so. A comfort. Terrian was not yet ready to let his own defenses down in this shrine of a hallway. He'd need to meet Master Giguere first.<br><br><i>There</i> was a name more in keeping with Terrian's expectations.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"I don't like the feel of this place."<br><br>"We're about 80% sure that there's a paranormal artifact in this house. Probably more. I'd be worried if you didn't have a bad feeling, Charlie."<br><br>"Yeah, I guess so," Charlie said. "Still."<br><br>Julia turned away from the window and looked at Charlie. He was sitting on the luxuriously dressed bed, cleaning rod in one hand, and a piece of his pistol in the other. He was looking up anxiously at the doctor. No, not anxiety. Concern.<br><br>"We'll be fine," Julia said. She smiled at him then turned back to the window, just surveying the world outside. After all, she was technically supposed to be in the mansion as a bodyguard. She could at least pretend she was trying to protect the owner of the estate. Charlie was doing a good job at looking the part, but then again, he was an official combat-trained agent.<br><br>Suddenly a voice sounded from an upward direction. Both Julia and Charlie looked up instinctively, as if looking for the person speaking. "Would all people aiding in guarding the premises please report to the main dining room? I repeat, would all people aiding in the guarding of the premises please report to the main dining room?"<br><br>"We've already been briefed. Do we really need to be there?" Charlie said.<br><br>"I'm actually curious to see who else was hired," Julia replied.<br><br>"Well then are you fine going alone? I'm not quite done here."<br><br>"Yes. Ruth already showed us around." With that, Julia turned around and made her way to the door. She grabbed her purse off the bed while she passed then stepped out, closing the door lightly behind her. She looked around at the ornately, if not gaudily, furnished hallway to get her bearings before heading straight for the dining room.<br><br>After a minute or so of walking, she found herself in the dining room. No one was around yet, so she simply took a seat, putting her purse on the table as she did. She pulled out some papers to read through while she waited.<br><br>OOC: Urg, crappy.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">A petite girl, barely five feet tall, entered the room from one of its other, myriad entrances. She stepped around the stately door, catching it with one fingertip to keep it from crushing into a cabinet full of china. She twitched the finger, and the door slammed shut. The panes of glass set in it rattled, and two pieces of dragon emblazoned pottery fell askew on their stands.<br><br>"So, I'm guessing that you two are supposed to be guarding the joint as well?" The girl jumped from a flatfooted stand, clearing the back of a chair, and sliding into her seat. She threw her elbows forwards on the table. The fine fabric of the tablecloth bunched up at her spot. A candelabra teetered precariously, a few waxy drops spattering the immaculate surface.<br><br>"Call me Achenes. No need for my last name."<br><br>"But really, Ms. Har-" Nopcsa, just entering the room, was thrown up against the wall. Achenes had his throat clenched tightly in her left hand, her right drawn back and ready to strike.<br><br>"How do you know?" She tightened her grip.<br><br>"I-" Nopcsa tensed the muscles in his neck, trying to loosen her grip. She remained attached, her fingers causing white marks on the side of his throat.<br><br>"Achenes, please let go of him. Master Giguere wouldn't like having one of his defenders killed by another. One could say that it's the last thing we could possibly need at the time." Ruth's tone was stern, but it seemed somewhat hollow, as if she herself could care less about her master's whims.<br><br>"I usually say, Charity first, Self last. That's the main policy of my school, after all. But that's not the case here. If he knows my last name, it means he has to have had something to do with-"<br><br>"Mindreading. That's why he's here. A mindreader, so he can tell the master if any of his guards are planning on turning against him." Ruth smiled slightly, despite the fact that Nopcsa was desperately flailing away not five feet from her.<br><br>Achenes glared at the maid, Nopcsa, and then stepped back, dropping the young man to his knees. He began gasping for breath, his shoulders rising and falling with each ragged choke.<br><br>"If you use my last name again, I'll break your jaw in three places. It's Achenes. Just that. Nothing else."<br><br>"Nothng-" Nopcsa inhaled again, some of the color returning to his face, "Nothing elss."<br><br>"Good."<br><br>"Are you all going to be at eachother's throats? If so, Master Giguere will be extremely disappointed in you. He went out of his way to hire the best he could find, to ask for aid from those he knew had reputations for consistency and expertise. Any more conflict between you, and I'd be forced to assume that he had made an error in his judgement. That doesn't happen."<br><br>"Sorry, miss. We'll behave better, right, Terrian?" Nopcsa clapped Terrian on the back heartily, his other hand still massaging where Achenes had seized him.<br><br>"I don't like who you picked. I'll make that clear right now. But I'll do my best not to injure either of them, unless they try to hurt me or whatever." Achenes slouched back into her seat, sliding into place.<br><br>"So..." Ruth stalked around the table, and pulled out a majestic chair, cushioned in crimson velvet, and with gold details playing along its elaborately carved wood. She let her hands slide along the arms, caressing them with familiar care, and then turned, taking a seat. She slid it forwards gently, and then looked up to the various people gathered about the dining room.<br><br>"So, any questions?"</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Terrian raised a hand. "Yeah, Ruth, I've got one," he said. "I think what I can probably do for you best is set up a patrol system, am I right? Cover the perimeter, establish surveillance stations, put together an emergency response unit..." By this point he was essentially just throwing in every security term he could think of. "Safety in numbers, yeah? So before I go putting my foot in my mouth the way we misguided souls so often do--" (he nodded to Nopcsa) "--I'd like to know if there are any areas of the building or grounds that are off-limits. I'm sure I'm not the only one who'd benefit from some insight as far as that goes."</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Rhys entered the dining room just in time to see a rather flamboyant young man thrown against the heavily ornamented wall behind him by a tiny slip of a girl who hardly looked capable. He hesitated outside the archway at the back of the room, surveying its occupants. <br><br>In addition to the man being harassed by the belligerent redheaded girl, he recognized the young woman at the other end of the room, Ruth, as the one who admitted him to the house earlier that afternoon. Another young woman, this one quite attractive, observed the scuffle from the other side of the table; opposite her, across the room, stood a dashing young gentleman who, judging by the look of concern, was affiliated with the one against the wall.<br><br>Ruth, from the head of the table, addressed the girl sternly, and the altercation dissolved as rapidly as it had developed. Hands in his pockets, Rhys leaned against the doorframe and waited to hear what was going on.<br></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Julia looked over the other guards as they filed in, attempting to assess their personalities and abilities. Her face, of course, didn't show scrutiny; instead she smiled in greeting to each of the other guests as they made their way in.<br><br>The first to enter, the small girl Achenes, made it clear what her specialization was: pure brute strength. It wasn't obvious whether or not she was fully in control of it; slamming the door with a twitch seemed like a mistake. However, jumping into a chair and then slamming one of the other guards against the wall revealed that she was one for showing off and having a violent temper. So she probably was in control.<br><br>The one who had been attacked, the mind-reader Nopcsa, had a touch of arrogance. Being nearly omnipotent would do that. Julia took note to watch her thoughts. She wouldn't want certain facts to surface.<br><br>A dashing young man had entered with the mind-reader. Nopcsa said the name Terrian, though the man never formally introduced himself to the group. Judging from the similarity in clothing, they worked together. Terrian was no expert in guard work, but did seem to be a master of using a lot of words to say absolutely nothing. Since he worked with a mind-reader, Julia figured he was probably a Power as well.<br><br>The last to enter was a quiet one. His posture and casual indifference to the fight showed that he was used to things like this happening. Despite the lean, he seemed attentive.<br><br>One last person quickly burst into the room, opening the closed door sharply. Charlie had a hand on his belt, right above his gun holster, ready to pull it out. <br><br>"Hey, I heard some banging. Everything all right here?"<br><br>"Yes, everything seems to be alright now," Julia said. Charlie relaxed somewhat at the sound of her reassurance. <br><br>Julia then turned to address Ruth. "I take it that our job is to do more than house sit, since this is a fairly specialized team. Is there anything special we need to know about what kind of people would try to get in? I guess it wouldn't hurt to ask what potential thugs would be after in here, but you'll probably say that it's a secret."</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">"Of course, Mr. Brogue. You and Nopcsa were picked for this, no? I believe that Master Giguere and Mr. Tylor collaborated on the selection. You were intended to provide reliable personel to keep the perimeter safe, while Nopcsa was supposed to stay near the Master's quarters and use his talents to ensure that no individuals could sneak by." Ruth glanced from face to face, making sure that each of the defenders comprehended what she had said.<br><br>"Which brings us to the answer to your question, Mr. Brogue. Yes, there are off limits areas. The basement is locked for a reason, it being where the Master stores his most valuable artifacts. There is little reason for him to worry about it, anyways. It's been properly warded by various sorceries and abjurations, so virtually nothing could force an entry through there and live." Ruth wet her lips, running an unusually large and pointed tongue along them. It wasn't to the point of freakishness, but it was still disconcerting.<br><br>"There is one other room that is not to be enterred. The master's private bedroom and water closet are off limits, totally. You can not enter those rooms, no matter what happens. He's already had his room heavily enchanted, and it would likely immediately disintegrate any non-authorized individual."<br><br>"Oh goody. Please tell me you put at least some placard or something, marking his door? Because I don't want to go looking for the bathroom and end up a pile of carpet sweepings," Achenes threw herself forwards, bracing her elbows on the table.<br><br>"You should know it already. It overlooks the front lawn. And the sole door leading into it is plated with gold leaf and accentuated with large rubies. I doubt that you could miss details like that."<br><br>"Just keep the hall light on, okay?" Nopcsa added, catching a glance from Achenes.<br><br>It was at that point that Charlie burst into the room. Nopcsa threw his hands in the air, though he remained stock still otherwise. Achenes didn't react physically, or so it seemed at first. With closer inspection, it was evident that her eyes were focused directly on the man's grip on the gun. They flicked to his eyes once, and then went back to regarding the weapon.<br><br>"Glad that your aid could join us, Ms. Romanesco. Have a seat, Mr. Andrews." Ruth kept her expression fairly still, not having wavered much in it since  Achenes' outburst earlier.<br><br>"Just a slight disturbance. A conflict in backgrounds, if you will-"<br><br>"You could call it that," Nopcsa wheezed, pointing to the handprint on his throat. It was now a painful shade of red.<br><br>"But yes, your job is not just to guard the house, but the Master as well-" Ruth turned to face Nopcsa.<br><br>"Do you sense any presences in here that would be hostile towards the Master?"<br><br>Nopcsa took on a concerned expression, and closed his eyes. He knew he could skip over himself and Terrian, but the others... Tricky business, finding one facet of a mind without digging too deep. Achenes checked out, as did Rhys and Charlie.  The woman, though... There were bits and pieces of thoughts, almost visible, but repressed, hidden, locked away. It was like gazing into a labyrinth, and hoping to find a single detail.<br><br>Her surface thoughts however, seemed to be fine. He'd just need to take a chance on that one.<br><br>"Nobody here wants to harm him."<br><br>"Good." Ruth answered, but it wasn't her voice. It was a suave, deep voice, rough around the edges. Like a man that had been smoking for a few years. She raised her hands before her, and slid one pair of fingers along another. A moment later, she had a ring in her palm.<br><br>And directly after that, Ruth was gone. It her place, a lean gentleman sat. His skin had a golden tone to it, and he had neatly trimmed blonde hair with a matching mustache. His age was indeterminate, anywhere between twenty and forty five, presumably. He was wearing a red silk suit, with a white dress shirt peaking out from beneath it.<br><br>"Master Giguere, I'm guessing?" Nopcsa offered, without missing a beat.<br><br>"Of course. But you all can call me Orville. That'd do just fine for now." He gave a winning smile, exposing somewhat pointed, incredibly white teeth.<br><br>"And I'll answer your question in a moment, Ms. Romanesco. But I do believe that such matters would be best discussed over a hearty dinner, no?"</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Terrian's posture was in a strange state for a few moments. He had responded to the abrupt arrival of the armed man, Mr. Andrews, by beginning to rise out of his chair with every intention to throw himself behind it if the man pulled out his gun. Then Andrews had spoken to the woman, Ms. Romanesco, and Terrian had stopped halfway through standing up. He had been making to sit back down again, but had stopped halfway through <i>that</i> when Ruth Mayor had tragically ceased to be and Orville Giguere had made his entrance. All of this precarious teetering up and down was doing a number on Terrian's knees, so that he was happy to stand up in full when Giguere mentioned dinner. It finally seemed as though Terrian had gotten his physical situation resolved to everyone's satisfaction, which was why he was so surprised when, immediately afterward, a sudden aching pain throbbed briefly through all of his muscles at once, and then was gone.<br><br>He saw Nopcsa's eyes flicker toward his; the mindreader had evidently noticed. Terrian quickly moved his smile on over to Master Giguere while mentally messaging all his outside duplicates: <i>Someone just get electrocuted?</i><br><br>But of the responses that came in, none reported any injury just then... If a duplicate had just died, Terrian thought it was awfully anticlimactic. More likely, it seemed, that for the first time all day, that pain had actually been his own.<br><br>Well. Hadn't lasted, that much was certain. So what could a guy do. Pretty much just cram it into the "unexplained phenomena" folder and move on. That was getting to be the heftiest folder in the filing cabinet of Terrian's brain, but at least it was bigger than the adjacent folder, "unexplained phenomena that'll probably kill me".<br><br>To Giguere, he said, "Such matters, and in fact <i>all</i> matters, don't you think?

Achenes frowned, and sat back, the tablecloth sliding towards her as she moved.<br><br>“Naturally, I have always felt the same. A warm, wholesome meal is the best remedy for one's troubles, whatever they may be,” He stood up, pushing out his seat slowly.<br><br>“Obesity?” Nopcsa answered with a juvenile smirk.<br><br>“A layer of fat is just the body's way of showing a life well lead, in my opinion,” Orville stepped around the side of the table, straightening the cloth as he went.<br><br>“Is that what life is to you? A chance to indulge in hedonism until you run out of it?” Achenes had taken to leaning on the armrest of her chair, one sleeve-clad hand under her chin.<br><br>“Not just hedonism. Hedonism could be said to be appreciation of the lesser things in life, while culture is an appreciation of the greater. Naturally, I indulge in both to the fullest degree that my inheritance has allowed,” Orville arrived at his china cabinet, and began scanning it, looking for the appropriate means for serving his guests.<br><br>“Reveling in such things is wasting money that could go to the poor and needy.”<br><br>“If it wasn't for the hedonistic money wasters, whatever would happen to all of the caviar farmers of the world?” Nopcsa winced as the redhead's gaze came to bear on him.<br><br>“Caviar? Feh, that's nothing,” Orville paused, staring at a set of nineteen plates and twenty one mismatched cups. He put a finger to his chin in thought, and then shook his head dismissively, “That's a 'delicacy' that people have when they want to feel like they're  rich. A true delicacy is something that is genuinely rare, something that only you on those you decide to share it with would ever get to experience.”<br><br>“So, you mean like when William Buckland ate the heart of King Louis the Fourteenth?” Nopcsa chimed in, his grin resuming once more.<br><br>“Essentially, like that, yes,” Orville closed the door to his china cabinet hastily, the glass rattling once more. He knelt down, opening a lower compartment.<br><br>“Disgusting!” Achenes had not paused in shifting around her seat, now slumped against the back.<br><br>“Disgusting? Maybe. But it's the event, the memory. That man was one of incalculably few who've ever tasted such a thing. That makes it worth more than all the caviar in the world, in my eyes,” Orville stood up, producing seven wine glasses. He walked behind the side of the table nearest him, setting one in front of each of the guards.<br><br>“Pass these across the table, please,” He handed two to Terrian, set the last towards the head of the table, and then went back for plates.<br><br>“What do you have in the way of beverages?” Nopcsa elbowed Terrian and threw a covert wink his way.<br><br>“Oh, not too much of interest to our group here. But I do have something that is of enough significance to warrant its sharing...” Orville finished passing out the plates, and went over to the wall. He slid a picture of a soaring dragon aside, revealing a small nook in the wall. He tapped three times on the metal walls inside the cubbyhole, and a loud puffing noise followed.<br><br>“Great vintage here. A traditional homemade wine from Shin-Ra, circa Nineteen Twenty Three. Almost a century before they opened trade, if I'm not mistaken,” He drew a sparkling wine bottle from the wall and replaced the picture. He took a firm hold of the cork, and plucked it from the bottle's neck.<br><br>“Here, allow me...” He poured a measure into each glass within reach, and then went back to his seat. The wine was white, sitting smoothly in each glass. A few blue sparks danced across the surface of the drink, flickering brilliantly.<br><br>“They say that the mages of that nation use magic to improve the quality of the wine. A rather clever use of their skills, if I do say so myself.”<br><br>“Excellent. But what's for dinner?” Nopcsa rapped on his plate with his knuckles.<br><br>“Whatever you want. Simply hold the plate, and voice your wish for a food item. Provided the enchantment on those plates holds, and nobody has too strong of an accent, you should get what you requested.”<br><br>“Nifty,” Nopcsa put his fingers on either side of the plate, feeling the cool china on his fingertips, “Well done steak, pan-seared with garlic, and sweet corn on the cob. Side of mashed potatoes, if you will...”<br><br>The room was filled with the scent of cooked meat and freshly boiled corn as the items appeared upon the mindreader's plate.<br><br>“Very nifty indeed.”<br><br>OOC: Next round: PLOT.</div></div>

So as to avoid making too much eye contact, he studied the fibers of the blonde gentleman's mustache. There was a familiar stirring up of Terrian's senses in reaction to Giguere. Envy... A man stood before him who'd achieved exactly what Terrian wanted: enough money to live however he wanted and without the least concern for the opinions of others. Here was the future Terrian had tried over and over to usher in, every time he'd made an attempt to duplicate a bill in his hand.<br><br>Then again (Terrian switched his crossed legs from one to the other), was this really how he wanted to live? Dressing in a red suit in a mansion full of dragon portraits and china, philosophizing about the nature of delicacies and hedonism? If he had the money to spend, would this be how he spent it? Or --<br><br>There was a nudging at his arm, from where Nopcsa sat. Giguere was holding out a pair of wine glasses to Terrian. He accepted them with a quick "Sure," nodded in thanks to Nopcsa, and set the glasses down in front of the farthest two, the armed man and his associate. The woman at least met his eyes when he gave her her glass, although he couldn't make anything out of her expression. The man didn't give him a glance.<br><br>After receiving his plate, Terrian watched Nopcsa's dinner materialize. "Oh cool," he said softly. He looked down at his own plate, which he was holding on either side. "All right, how about... chicken? Some roasted chicken, please."<br><br>Nothing happened. Terrian couldn't help feeling that the plate was expecting a more elaborate request. "And... some steamed green beans and a baked potato? That should--" But the complete meal had already appeared. The chicken breast was still sizzling. Terrian stole another glance at Nopcsa to make sure he didn't look green in the face before getting started.

He himself was focused mostly on the lasagna and crisp salad on his own plate. It was quite possibly the best lasagna he had ever tasted -- but really, what had he expected? Giguere hardly seemed like the type to settle for magical plates that spawned lousy food. The wine was likewise spectacular, pairing well with his pasta despite it being white; it seemed to effervesce as he sipped it, a sensation that he accredited to the odd blue sparks.<br><br>Highly satisfied with the meal, Rhys decided it was time to confront his next-biggest concern: What were all these people doing here and what exactly needed guarding? He was here as a delivery boy, nothing more. That some five other people had shown up coincidently at the same time was suspicious at best.<br><br>The table was quiet, save for the clatter of silverware as the dinner guests ate. Rhys thought it over for a moment and decided that he absolutely did not want to pose the question to the whole table out of fear of sounding utterly ignorant. <br><br>Beside him, Nopcsa chewed his steak placidly. Rhys considered for a moment. In the short time that he had known him (for lack of a better term), he decided that he liked the flamboyant mind-reader well enough. And Nopcsa and Terrian appeared to be nothing if not approachable. <br><br>He half-turned his head to them.

He chewed it slowly as Rhys waited for a more direct answer.<br><br>"Basically, our boss works-" Nopcsa's tone suddenly hushed. He glanced across the table at Julia, and then his eyes flicked back to Rhys, "Well, our whole company works in the production, acquisition, and distribution of arcane products for the end consumer. Giguere happens to be one of our better customers."<br><br>"My guess on what you're doing here? Well, I'd say that our boss happened to hear that you were some manner of Power, and pulled a few strings to get you here. Really, makes sense. If you can do anything more than 'flood the other guy in socks' or 'piss the other guy off' in a fight, you're much better off than us two," Nopcsa went to put an arm around Terrian, cocked his head, and then pulled away.<br><br>"I wouldn't know what our going rate would be for a night of babysitting this guy and his fortune. But I'll see about twisting my boss's arm into giving you a good rate-" Nopcsa slipped another piece of meat into his mouth.<br><br>"Heck, if that doesn't work, I'll give you a cut of my pay. It's worth it, if it means having somebody who can fight on our side here."<br><br>"Hey, I can fight. Probably better than lanky over there, too," Achenes piped up. She had been shoveling brown rice from her plate into her mouth until that moment, using a pair of battered looking chopsticks produced from somewhere on her person.<br><br>"There's a difference between being able to control shadows at will and being able to hit things really hard," Nopcsa shot back, talking over Terrian.<br><br>"I'd rather count on somebody reliable and weak than somebody strong that a bunch of cheats and conmen brought in for the job," Achenes took another bite of her rice, and started chewing thoroughly.<br><br>"Why not have both, as I've always said?" Giguere spoke, sawing away at the leg of lamb in front of him. He hadn't yet started eating, despite his aparent enthusiasm earlier.<br><br>"That's always been part of my way in life. Be it dinner, artwork, friends, business associates, women..." He took his first bite of his dinner, and paused.

She may have been showing confidence, but she was only doing it to reassure her companion. Inside, she was as confused and wary as he was. "Grilled chicken caeser salad."<br><br>The salad appeared on her plate as requested. Julia smiled at Charlie before picking up her fork. She took a small bite first, slowly chewing it. It tasted... fresh. She smiled at Charlie once again.<br><br>"Well, alright. Guess these work as advertised," Charlie said, still subtly playing with his plate.

She knew mindreaders were almost always nonchalant around people; they knew everyone's thoughts, so why worry about danger? That was the issue; he was almost forcing some of his casual interactions. Add to that the occasional quick, furtive glances and somewhat hushed tones. He was cautious. Of her, specifically.<br><br>Julia focused on her salad.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Terrian looked up from his potato. Giguere's words had caught his attention again. This was a man who just got more and more interesting with every syllable he ushered forth from his flytrap. The syllables "A and B", especially, these were some very good syllables. Really it was as if Giguere's philosophy on life was tailor-made to be everything that Terrian wanted. He got down another bite of chicken and annnounced, "You and I--" <br><br>He realized he was already nabbing some green beans so he went ahead with those before continuing. "You and I have a rapport that I think we need to acknowledge before its obvious but unmentioned existence just gets awkward."<br><br>A <i>and</i> B. The ideal combination of A or otherwise and B or otherwise. This policy had done wonders for Terrian in his life so far. Faced with two courses of action, why shouldn't he exercise his natural prerogative to do both at once? Cheating maybe, if you wanted to call it that, but who was Terrian to decide where the Power genes cropped up and where they didn't? He'd been favored with a lucky draw, so what was the problem with taking advantage of that?<br><br><i>Yeah,</i> said the old voice in his head. <i>Real paragon of balance and neutrality there, chief. Almost makes you wonder why you didn't go ahead and shoot</i> everyone <i>back there in the field. Why pick a side? Just off Garth</i> and <i>Natalie, isn't that the theory?</i><br><br>Terrian's gaze darkened even as his smile grew cheerier. That time had been different. It'd had to be A or B. He couldn't have done both.<br><br><i>And your pick was exactly the masterfully-thought-out decision we would expect. There totally weren't any consequences either. Yessir when the chips are down and there's no soft option at hand, Terrian Brogue really does know how to</i><br><br>Terrian chewed his next bite of chicken so loudly that he could not even hear himself think.<br><br><br><i>OOC: You can't tell I haven't written Terrian in a while, can you?</i></div></div>

With a genteel flourish, his removed the plate from before Charlie.<br><br>“Of course, the heart is one of the <i>better</i> cuts in an animal. It toils away every moment of the creature’s life, pushing blood so that the rest of the body may partake in life. It naturally is very lean, having known naught but travail for all of its existence,” He slipped the organ onto his plate with a wet smack.<br><br>“In its repose, it is sweeter than all of its brethren,” Orville sat down once more, and then cocked his head slightly, “Of course, I’m curious, Mr. Andrews… Were you thinking of the heart of a pig, or a human heart?”<br><br>“Human. So totally human. Like, more human than human even,” Nopcsa inserted himself into the conversation, smirking across the table at the slightly nauseous Foundation member.<br><br>“Thank you, Nopcsa. The similarities are quite enough that it’s impossible to distinguish between the two without taking a taste, assuming they’ve been properly prepared,” With a faint smile, he began slicing into the heart with gusto.<br><br>“Dude, what the hell?” It was Achenes turn to stand up from her seat, apparently. Had somebody been clever with a boombox, it would have appeared to be an especially luxurious game of Musical Chairs.<br><br>“That’s a guy’s heart! You’re eating a freakin’… A freakin’ HEART! That’s cannibalism!”<br><br>“Two key points disprove your argument, Ms. Achenes. First of all, these plates are imbued with creative magic, and not summoning magic. They are essentially making a replica of a heart for me to eat. And, secondly, if you’ve noted my appearance and my predilections, I’m not exactly what one would call a human in the first place,” Giguere fondly stroked the head of a wyvern-shaped candleholder.<br><br>“What are you, then?” Achenes seemed to have more questions than that, but the verbal slap had left her without much footing.<br><br>“Oh, just a bit of something so much more infinitely grand than the apes we see staggering through the streets daily. Unfortunately, I am mostly human, but that twelve point five percent that isn’t…” He smiled as if enraptured, and looked towards the ceiling, “Oh, that little portion of me is worth more than everything else I have in this world.”<br><br>“Apes? So you’re saying that anybody whose great grandma didn’t boink Smaug should be in the zoo?” Nopcsa didn’t flavor his comment with much intonation, though there still were traces of mischief to be found.<br><br>“I’d never say such a thing as that, not in the least,” Giguere took his first bite of the heart, and paused to chew it thoughtfully, “I’d refer to the common rabble that you see wandering the byways of America, and indeed, the world over, as apes. No foresight, no appreciation for culture, petty and immature even in their attempts at hedonism. That’s a waste.”<br><br>“As for the present company, though, the simple fact that you’re here today shows you’ve got connections and talents far beyond the hazy aspirations and bleakly polished skills of the hoi polloi. You’re an upper crust of humanity, individuals that even my ancestors would consider worth associating with.”<br><br>“It’s times like this where I start wondering why the hell I’m even here. You’ve got all of this power, all of this potential to do something, and you just-“ Achenes’ voice was rough. She was speaking from her chest, the words echoing slightly in the room.<br><br>“Sit on it like a dragon with an egg,” Nopcsa concluded.<br><br>“Indeed, that is what I do. Do not begrudge me the nature of my bloodline, Achenes, and I’ll try not to be too perturbed by your stereotypical Irish temper,” Giguere took a sip of his wine, and met her blazing eyes with a powerful calm, “Besides, what you’re doing is bringing me out of this habit of mine, to a degree. By accepting pay for protecting me for one evening, you get a portion of my wealth. And then you may distribute it as you see fit, aiding the rise of more people from this bleak ocean known as humanity.”<br><br>“Mayhaps, even, I could give you one of these plates. Think of how much that would better the lives in a third world village,” Giguere’s smugness was almost palpable. Achenes sat down before her employer could hurl his weight around any more.<br><br>“Speaking of which, Charlie, it’d be unwise for me to leave you unfed. You are, after all, one of the people charged with the protection of my life and estate. An empty stomach could be the difference between success and failure. Do try your wine, I’ll see to providing something for you,” The host swept the lingering juices from the dish with a napkin, and then laid it on the table once more.<br><br>“It seems that our comrade isn’t the most adventurous among us. If you could, provide him with something simple and certain not to mortify him. Chicken fingers and French fries sounds like a good enough fit.”<br><br>The plate gleamed for an instant, apparently cleansing itself more thoroughly, and then was filled with the meal demanded of it. Large slices of white meat, perfectly breaded, rested on a bed of crisp fries. A barbecue sauce, evidently made from scratch and of a southern recipe, was drizzled in an elaborate pattern over the dinner. The plate passed from hand to hand until it reached its intended consumer.<br><br>“Now, what rapport do you speak of, Mr. Brogue?” Giguere leaned forwards, his golden eyes attempting to meet Terrian’s evasive gaze.<br><br>“He tried some stuff in college. <i>Experimented</i> with a hydra once, or something like that,” Nopcsa didn’t look up from the corn, intently gnawing away at it, "You can imagine how that would become awkward."<br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler4079388').toggle();if($('#spoiler4079388').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler4079388">OOC: HALF YEAR REVIVAL, HO!</div></div></div>

"The most awkward."<br><br>He looked around at the others: Mr. Andrews, accepting the plate of chicken with obvious reluctance; Ms. Romanesco, keeping her gaze intently on her salad; Ms. Achenes, glaring at a painting of a dragon conveniently beyond Orville Giguere's head; Mr. Whitticker, pallidly tapping a finger on his empty plate. Oh, and everyone's favorite friend. The star of the evening. Terrian rested his forearms on the table, leaned forward, and gave Nopcsa a look that would have said quite plainly even if he wasn't a mindreader, <i>Fock you and, equally, fuck Auguste Tylor.</i> In fact this was such a specific and nuanced facial expression that even a non-mindreader could have followed it further into this translation: <i>Tell him I'll stick with shirt duty next time.</i><br><br>But the act of leaning forward had stirred up something within him that was better off staying down. Terrian took in a heavy breath. Then he opened his mouth, closed it again, and next managed: "Mr. Giguere, I'm afraid I must have missed the half bath on the way in. Could I...?"

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Terrian smiled tightly, stood up, and passed out of the room and back into the hallway. Obviously Giguere had excused him without actually letting him know where the bathroom was. Only natural. Terrian hadn't wanted to open his mouth again to ask, though. He sidestepped a statue of a rampaging dragon and slid open a panel with one stiff hand. Wrong. Closet. He pressed on. The half bath was at the other end of the hall, beneath the staircase. Tiny, but not too shabby. Done up in marble. Dim incandescent lighting. Terrian closed the door, locked it, dialed the ventilation all the way up, stuffed a hand towel into the crack under the door, turned around, lifted the toilet seat, and threw up neatly into the bowl.<br><br>After, he flushed, mopped up with a few damp paper towels, turned around, and sat fully clad on the toilet seat, bent double. With his elbows on his knees, he stared through the diamond shape made by his calves and forearms onto the tiled floor. Then he jerked one foot slightly in pain. A duplicate mentally apologized for tripping.<br><br>Why his power should have been engineered so that everyone had their off days all at once escaped Terrian.<br><br>He was going through a rough enough day as it was without anyone else's help.<br><br>He reached over to the sink, turned on the cold water, and cupped a hand to catch some, but sloshing it down his throat didn't do much to scrub out the foul aftertaste. He thought about Giguere slicing into the heart and almost felt round two coming on. He decided to think about something else. Perhaps how fucked-up the Fascere Order was.<br><br>"Very," he affirmed aloud to no one.<br><br>Though he wasn't the only one in the bathroom for long. In another moment a duplicate stood up off the toilet seat, picked up the hand towel, replaced it on the rack, and opened the door. Three more duplicates followed him out into the hallway. They all looked exactly like a train and a mountain who'd decided to work out their problems through violence.<br><br>Terrian didn't really say anything to them. There wasn't any need. They knew what they were doing. The first duplicate headed unsteadily back down the hall toward the dining room. The other three duplicates split ways and made themselves scarce.<br><br>The last one of them was kind enough to close the door again for Terrian's benefit before he left.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Charlie reluctantly took the plate of chicken fingers. He stared at it for a moment before venturing a poke with his fork. It didn't squirt blood everywhere. That was a start. Hesitantly, he skewered the smallest piece and raised it to his mouth, regarding it for a moment before taking a bite.<br><br>"Ok, ok, this is pretty good," he said in between chews. "Fanciest chicken fingers I've ever had, in fact."<br><br>If Julia could play the nonchalant game, so could he. Everything had been going so ridiculously throughout the night that he was beginning to think it was all just some fucked up dream. He looked down at his watch, took another bite of chicken, then looked back at his watch to make sure the time was right. Damn. Not a dream. Either that or his subconscious was working really hard to keep this elaborate prank going.<br><br>Oh well. Don't look a gift horse in the mouth, right?<br><br>He took the last bit of chicken from his fork with one big bite then glanced over at the woman responsible for reminding him of that quote. Unlike earlier, she didn't seem as collected as before. Her eyes weren't widened, but they were slightly dilated and glazed over, like she was no longer paying attention. Her breathing was slightly deeper than before.<br><br>"Hey Doc." Charlie whispered.<br><br>The doctor poked at a piece of lettuce.<br><br>"Julia." He nudged her.<br><br>"He just ate a heart," she said, barely audible even to her partner.<br><br>Right. Dragon man. Charlie had almost successfully used the chicken nuggets to stop that memory from forming properly.<br><br>"A heart..." she said again, even quieter than before.<br><br>With the least amount of ceremony possible, Charlie forked another piece of chicken and held it in front of Julia's face.<br><br>"I. Um. Wh– thank you," the woman said, her composure quickly going back to what could be considered "normal" at this time. She plucked the piece of chicken off the fork and took a bite.<br><br>Right. Just keep pretending it's a dream. Chicken fingers that are so good they can snap someone out of shock don't actually exist in real life.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message"><b><i>Washington, D.C.</i></b><br><br>There was a man on the cusp of middle-age standing in front of a young and beautiful redhead who was sitting at a desk with only a few very important purposes. It needed to hold a phone, a laptop, a notepad, and some pens while simultaneously keeping her long legs and fully automatic pistol out of view. The man waited quietly while the secretary checked his identification against company records. The shaved head on her computer screen matched the one on top of the gray three piece suit in the room with her. Tattoos crept above the collar of his shirt and out of his sleeves.<br><br>"Welcome to Joyeuse Anti-Insurgency Services, Mr. Hadley. Have a seat and Mr. Mistric will be right with you."<br><br>Before he could turn around to sit, a voice called out through the door at the other end of the room.<br><br>"Come on in, Mr. Hadley. Shut the door behind you."<br><br>David Hadley did as he was told. There was a click as the latch fell back in its seat but the sound died quickly in the vastness of the room. Instead there was only the droning of track lighting on top of industrial air-conditioning, as well as the scratching of a pencil on paper. The berber carpet swallowed his footsteps as he made his way to the desk in the corner of the room. The quietness of the room was of such weight and resolution that it was impossible to ignore. You would either find it calming or maddening. David liked it. There were a great many chaotic elements in his life and a solid silence was always welcome. He stood wordless in front of the desk with his arms in front of him, one hand grasping the other's wrist, and enjoyed the momentary monotony while he waited for the man he'd come to see to finish whatever it was he was doing.<br><br>After a few minutes, William Mistric put the pencil down and leaned back in his chair. He massaged the knuckles of his pen-hand and exhaled a puff of relief. <br><br>"Thank you for waiting, Mr. Hadley. I meant to have this done by the time you got here but I just received an update to the assignment a short while ago and then you showed up early."<br><br>"I don't like to be late."<br><br>"Good man." Mistric slipped off his glasses and set them on the desk then leaned forward to address David. "Are you familiar with a Mr. Orville Giguere?"<br><br>"I have heard the name, sir. Not much more."<br><br>"That seems to be the case with most people." Mistric put his glasses back on and picked up a photograph on his desk. After looking at it for a moment he handed it over to David. <br><br>"That's his mansion. That's where your assignment is."<br><br>"What is the assignment, sir?"<br><br>"Giguere is set to receive a package of some great importance, the nature of which remains unknown to us. The client claims that they are the rightful owners of the package and that Giguere arranged for it to be stolen from them. They want it back. Whether or not they're telling the truth is irrelevant; their money is real and they're giving it to us so that we might retrieve the package for them."<br><br>"Expendables?"<br><br>"Should be kept to a minimum. Let me be clear that Giguere is not a target here. The client merely wants the package. What little is known of Giguere, his wealth is a certainty; I don't want to cut off a potential client. I expect him to be under guard at all times and there may be other players gunning for the package so watch yourself, Hadley." He gave David the papers he'd been writing on earlier. "That's a list of likely… <i>entities</i> you might come across. We did a little digging and found that Giguere had been reaching out to gifted individuals through various channels, presumably for guard duty. That's got the top suspects and a little background on them and their notabilities."<br><br>"Yes, sir. Anything else?"<br><br>"No, that will be all. Here's the dossier." Mistric picked up a thick manila envelope and passed it over to David who dropped in the papers along with the photograph he'd been handed earlier. "Plane ticket to Salt Lake, a couple of maps, aerial photos, a blueprint of questionable certainty, and various other information you might find useful. Jessica will give you your advance and authorize your credit line on the way out." <br><br>"Thank you, sir."<br><br><br><b><i>Salt Lake City</i></b><br><br>He'd scaled the wall surrounding the grounds and landed in the midst of a garden near the mansion. David could see lights on in a few areas of the estate but he was in darkness for the time being. Carefully, he made his way to the house and sat against the wall, out of sight. <br><br><i>Time for some reconnaissance. </i><br><br>He looked down at his hand, specifically, the tattoo of a black widow spider on his left hand. The ink trembled and then his skin stretched and peeled as leg after leg crept into the night air. In a few seconds the spider broke free completely and there was only clean flesh where the tattoo had been. David placed his hand on the wall and the spider hurried towards a cracked window on the second floor.</div></div>

Also I am well aware that the size of this post and the time it spent in the chute means I have essentially</i> become <i>Lee. Also Ninety owes me a barista now.</i></div><br><br>The duplicate Brogue gently unlaced one black dress shoe, noting as he did so that both were looking pretty lackluster; he’d apparently trod in one too many salt lakes on the way to the mansion. He slid the shoe off his foot, straightened up, and threw it across the long, steeply downward-sloping hall ahead. The shoe landed on the velvety red carpet at the corner where the hall veered right. Brogue watched carefully, but the shoe had already passed the first test, which was that it had not dissolved into a fine mist at any point on its trajectory. Test number two demonstrated that the arrival of the shoe did not cause a pair of identical little girls in blue dresses to round the corner and face him. That was enough empirical experimentation to go on for the moment. It seemed the hallway was safe. Brogue moved forward slowly, exerting care to keep his balance on the heavily inclined floor, but he didn’t take into account how soon the ceiling would drop down into a low slope so he banged his head, obviously.<br><br>Now it could well be said that concern for one’s life meant something different to a duplicate than to the progenitor. If this Brogue accidentally toed a magic booby trap or ran into a murderous ghost or some such, well, in all dispassionate honesty that wouldn’t exactly be the end of things. Terrian Brogue the collective would go right on his merry way. So there shouldn’t have been any excuse for the duplicate to feel the tension – no, let’s be frank, the raw fear – that was creeping in from all sides as he himself crept through the corridors of the mansion. It wasn’t the existential concerns of death that threatened him. Then, what? Maybe the knowledge that there was no precedent yet for a duplicate of Terrian Brogue dying; thus no way to foresee the physiological effect this would have on the progenitor. Would a part of him perish along with the dupe? What might “a part of him” even mean? This specific duplicate would’ve preferred not to be the first to help Terrian find out.<br><br>Or perhaps it was something else?<br><br>Perhaps the simple fact that he was already busily imagining what the thing might look like, the ghost or demon or whatever might cross his path within this mansion. Perhaps the sheer animal fact that he did not <i>want</i> to encounter this fiend and look upon its face.<br><br>Nothing more than one plain atavistic understanding: This Brogue did not wish to die.<br><br>When he reached the fallen shoe, he spent a prudent moment peering around the corner while showing the least of his face that he could manage. The empty hallway banked right and continued down; surely he was well below ground at this point. At the bottom of this slope stood a pair of unusually wide doors, both open. Brogue grappled with a sudden urge to turn back before remembering that the basement was supposed to be “locked” in addition to its magical protections. Anyway, there didn’t seem to be anything through the doors but a free-standing iron staircase that led back upward. Even so, Brogue scooped up the shoe and tossed it again before proceeding. <br><br>It cleared the doors and landed safely, though this time with an audible clatter that resounded back to where Brogue stood: the velvet carpeting had given out, and the shoe had landed on a harder surface, possibly stone. He moved steadily down the hall to retrieve it, noticing as he began his descent that the framed pictures all the way down the wall on his left were of the same size and shape. Hitherto the hallway had been decorated with yet more paintings and drawings of dragons (whose mystical appeal had long since worn tiresome for this duplicate), and this menagerie continued down the wall on the right, interspersed with three small closed doors; but the hangings on the left were obviously part of a cohesive set, about a dozen altogether. In fact they weren’t illustrations at all, but a series of black-and-white photographs.<br><br>The first few depicted a middle-aged Asian man sitting at a small desk, situated inexplicably in the center of an otherwise bare room. In the first picture his expression was calm, placid, not to say unreadable, but by the fourth his brow had furrowed and the corners of his mouth had pulled back in an expression of grim unease. In the fifth photograph he’d lifted a wrinkled hand to his mouth and was apparently coughing into it. Next he was buckled over in his chair, both elbows on the desk, covering his face. In the seventh photograph, his blurry form lurched up from the chair and out of frame, knocking the chair to the floor, where it lay in the eighth photograph. The next was identical, with the man nowhere to be found, until the tenth revealed an arm reaching into the frame for the desk. Brogue squinted at the strange dark patch visible on the man’s forearm. A shadow? No, it wasn’t uniform in color, there were glints of light here and there on its surface. Not blood… his arm didn’t appear wounded… The angle was different in the eleventh photograph: the camera, which must have stood on a tripod, had clearly been pushed aside. The man was still out of frame, although a splintered shape on the floor in the corner soon proved to be the upended desk. The next print was identical.<br><br>Then, in the following photograph, the man loomed into view once again, hunched asymmetrically to favor his left side, and Brogue came close to voicing a cry of revulsion. The dark splotches now covered what was visible of his skin, giving him a vaguely bovine appearance that was halfway to comic, but Brogue could now see that this was not purely a change of color: the harsh light overhead cast a fine honeycomb pattern on what could only be scales. But the face was worse – somehow much worse, even though the change there took Brogue longer to notice.<br><br>The man’s face, from the eyes down, was growing longer. His nose and jawline jutted forth grotesquely from his cheeks as though he were being sucked into a vacuum. His wide mouth gaped to reveal two rows of inhumanly sharp teeth.<br><br>When Brogue managed to tear his eyes away from this image to glance further down the wall, it was to look upon only stone.<br><br>He’d reached the end of the corridor. <br><br>Still not entirely trusting the shoe experiment, Brogue stripped off his jacket and, after a quick glance behind him up the hallway, waved the jacket like a matador’s cape across the doorway. He couldn’t help but half-expect the black shape to burst aflame in the middle of its batlike flapping. But after a moment he lowered the jacket, then slid it back over his shoulders. He raised his unshod foot and slowly, gently, toed the divide between the crimson carpet and the stone. Then he decided he was being an idiot and that this was not the basement proper. He stepped forward.<br><br>Nothing happened.<br><br>Brogue reached down to retrieve the shoe from the densely tiled floor, then looked up at the extent of this cylindrical stairwell. Strange: he hadn’t remembered seeing so many floors on the outside. Obviously he was below ground, but surely not <i>that</i> far below ground… It looked as though there were seven or eight flights’ worth of iron stairs leading upward, not spiraling but rather zigzagging directly from floor to floor. And then Brogue really thought he must be seeing it wrong, because some of the stairways looked completely redundant, leading between pairs of nonadjacent floors and skipping the one in between, while other stairways linked the three floors one-to-one. While gazing up, at least, from the bottom, the jumble of crisscrossing stairways gave an uncomfortable impression of Escher.<br><br>Here at the lowest floor, opposite the hallway, stood a tall, thin, dark door that was carved several feet back into the stone and fitted with an ornate brass knob. The basement proper, no doubt. He gave this a wide berth.<br><br>Brogue made to sit on the staircase and put his shoe back on, but thought better of it after comparing the iron grate steps to a smooth stone bench at one side, curved to fit the contour of the wall. He opted for the bench, cleverly managing not to strike his skull a second time on the light fixture overhead. (Modern, yet in the shape of a torch, it jutted out from the wall and cast a dusky incandescent glow from behind a thick glass shell. Similar “torches” lined the walls going all the way up the stairwell.) As Brogue tied the wingtip’s laces, he inspected the tiles on the floor, which came in two groups of colors: shades of vermillion, beige and gold, and of grey and black. Though there was a noticeable channel of grey and black tiles running along the diameter of the circle, the dispersion of colors seemed otherwise to be random, with carelessly placed streaks of dark tiles all over the “background” of the brighter hues.<br><br>It wasn’t until Brogue stood up from the bench and started toward the staircase that he noticed a face in the floor.<br><br>He stopped short, though more out of surprise than horror. After the sequence of photographs in the corridor, this apparition was less unnerving… though still more than a little off-putting, he had to admit. The face was thinly etched out of dark tiles against the bright oranges and tans. Two short, jagged rows of dark tiles suggested eyes shut tight, and there was the appearance of a hollow in place of the nose. The mouth, a lopsided oval of dark tiles enclosing bright ones, wound back and forth toward the wall for nearly twice the length of the rest of the face. It was hard not to mentally supply the scream of anguish that might have issued from that almost ghostly mouth.<br><br>He couldn’t believe this was an accident of arrangement. As he looked around the perimeter of the circle, he was sure he saw other faces with similar expressions, some with wide rings of dark tiles to suggest open, staring eyes, others that might have had no eyes at all. By now his feeling of healthy, transient surprise had overstayed its welcome and progressed into an abiding dread. He glanced up the stairwell with a sharp breath, but nothing rotted and shriveled was lurching down the steps above to greet him. Even so Brogue had a pretty strong idea that it was time to get out of here. He compared options, and decided that the speed of the stairwell outweighed the familiarity of the hallway, given that what was familiar in the hallway he had no wish to look at a second time.<br><br>Brogue laid a hand on the iron railing before it occurred to him to worry that the metal might react with defensive enchantments and melt his flesh off. Fortunately nothing of the sort happened so that was all right then. He made it up to the first landing without all the stairs constricting to grind him into a blood-soaked sheet of skin so he really felt he was more or less in the clear at this point. Then he looked down once again onto the mosaic at the bottom of the stairwell.<br><br>He could no longer see the faces. No matter where he looked on the mosaic, he couldn’t discern a single one of what had been at least half a dozen expressions down below. It couldn’t be that the tiles had changed color, because that was extremely stupid, and anyway the long channel of dark tiles cutting most of the way across the diameter looked the same as before. He had simply “unseen” the faces. Which struck the duplicate as pretty stupid and implausible in its own right until he realized that they had never been there to begin with.<br><br>How could they have?<br><br><i>Obviously</i> the design was supposed to be crows!<br><br>He could see them all over the floor, dark shapes with zigzagging wings outstretched in all increments of flight. Loosed feathers of black and grey (<i>remiges and rectrices</i>, he thought suddenly) danced everywhere in the orange and golden sky. By a neat trick, from the angle where Brogue stood just outside the door to re-enter the first floor, several of the birds appeared to be “perched” on the railing of the staircase leading up from below. They were pulling something indistinct between their beaks. <br><br>Brogue moved to open the door, then decided that it was his duty in the name of intelligence-gathering to take another look at the mosaic from higher up. He ascended a very steep stairway off to one side that took him directly up to the third floor. All the while he kept his eyes on the floor, but it wasn’t until he could lean over the railing on the third landing that some mental click shifted his focus and he saw the new image.<br><br>The mosaic showed a sea of hands outstretched, clawing and fumbling in all directions. Some were clenched into fists; others pointed. Many of them were holding things, although the duplicate had to strain to figure out what the crudely-shaped objects were supposed to be: a flail here, a cross there, and over there… only when Brogue noticed that hand’s curved totem was tearing into the flesh of another nearby hand did he realize with a wince that it was meant to be a sickle.<br><br>He moved up a shallow stairway which threatened to quiver slightly under his tread to the fourth landing, and was faced with a new image: the fingers and limbs had become branches and coalesced into a pattern of interlocking trees pointing inward, nearly all of them barren, with only a few scant leaves here and there and a single empty nest which rested askew near the stone bench. Up directly to the sixth floor, on a stairway that twisted unnecessarily around the stairs connecting the fourth and fifth, and now the branches had become dark tendrils of lightning that pelted down from great fiery clouds around the circumference of the floor toward the center. On to the seventh floor, where all the streaks of black and grey tiles across the mosaic seemed to find harmony with each other, and to connect into a broken but unmistakable cobweb. But that long dark shape which had always remained at the middle of the circle looked nothing like a spider. As he squinted down at it from this distance, Brogue supposed it might be a centipede or some other thing that crept in segments. Suspended there in string, it could do nothing but wait for the cobweb’s unseen proprietor to return.<br><br>From the seventh floor to the eighth and highest, the narrow stairway had no railing. There was also no door leading off the eighth landing back into the rest of the house, making this final ascent, apparently, quite useless in addition to potentially dangerous. But Brogue knew full well he had to see. So he took hold of the steps ahead with both hands, uncomfortably aware that to fall would likely mean snapping his spine in half on one of the railings below, and crawled more than walked up the last stairway.<br><br>Though much of the mosaic had now been obscured by the staircases leading up from below, Brogue could, by circling the top platform and craning his neck, take the image in from a variety of angles. The black and grey lines didn’t appear to form a cobweb anymore, that much was plain… and then he caught a glimpse of what had prior been the centipede, and he stopped short.<br><br>It was the long, slitted pupil of an enormous eye, staring up from the bottom of the stairwell with raw animal malice. The eyeball was colored golden and red, and all the darker tiles streaked around the circle were veins, crisscrossing and interlacing from every side toward the middle. At first the utterly inhuman shape of the pupil suggested a panther or other great cat, but then Brogue thought of snakes, and after that it wasn’t difficult to imagine what creature’s eyeball was truly depicted here.<br><br>Brogue stepped back involuntarily and came up against something angular. It was a small, antique-looking two-shelf bookcase that only came up to his waist. He’d been so taken with the mosaic as not to notice it. He got down on one knee to examine the books with a puzzled frown. Why keep them up here? There was no chair and no reading lamp (nor a skylight overhead, not that it would’ve helped at this hour). Worse, the duplicate realized, to bring any reading material up or down the stairs would require one to be on one’s feet, since these books were no pocket paperbacks. Altogether this must have been the most inconvenient place in the entire mansion for storage of any kind, let alone of literature. So of course Brogue slid the heftiest volume out from the lower shelf, sat with his back against the stone wall and his shoes just dangling out beyond the edge of the platform, and, by the muted light of the torch-like fixtures around and below, began to read.<br><br></div></div>

Those assclowns in white are too busy gladhanding and palling around to even think of the possible dangers you could be in."<br><br>"I'll have you know I graduated with high honors from the most prestigious Assclown University in the Country!" Nopcsa proclaimed, standing up and slamming his palms on the table for emphasis.<br><br>Achenes arched an eyebrow.<br><br>"Well, okay, actually, I flunked out.

Giguere broke off his draught, and came up for air.<br><br>"Achenes, dear girl, you have to understand. Everything in life is ultimately about pleasure, be it in the present, or leaving a legacy so audacious that scholars will smirk while telling your story a hundred years from now. If offering my would be assassin a plate and a glass of wine when he bursts into the room to shoot me nets me a bullet in the chest, than so be it!

He'd already know it if anything foul was afoot, right?"<br><br>"If it has a brain, I've got it tracked," Nopcsa offered gamely, tapping his temple with his forefinger.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">After an inordinately long pause, Giguere spoke again, swirling the wine in his glass.<br><br>“I was informed that I will die tonight-“<br><br>He was cut off by Nopcsa choking on the sherbet that he’d conjured up for dessert.<br><br>“Wait, by who? That’s the kind of info that you should probably <i>include in the mission briefing</i>,” Nopcsa spat.<br><br>“Maydell Shouse. Perhaps you heard of her? Direct heir to the Oracular traditions of Delphi, a lineage that goes back over three millennia. A personal friend of mine, as all of the most influential people tend to be.”<br><br>“Shouse said you were going to croak?” Nopcsa pushed out his chair, and stood up, “Well, <i>shit</i>, that’s the ballgame. I’m going to have to tell Auguste that this was a fool’s errand, right from the start. ‘Terrian’, we should get going.”<br><br>The Brogue interrupted the befuddled look he was giving Giguere, in order to share his baffled expression with Nopcsa.<br><br>“You haven’t heard of Maydell Shouse? Of course not,” Nopcsa put his hands on the arm of Terrian’s chair, and leaned in, his voice a harsh whisper.<br><br>“Maydell Shouse is the world’s foremost seer and as Giguere says, a literal Oracle. Her visions always, always come to pass.  <i>Always.</i> When that yahoo Valon blew headquarters to bits? She was the one who told us it was going to happen,” Nopcsa stood up, straightened his shirt, and sighed, “My apologies, Mister Giguere, it has been a pleasure, and I mean no offense by this, but your ass is grass.”<br><br>“Not necessarily,” Giguere held up his index finger, the gesture emphasizing how clawlike his fingernails actually were, “There was an escape clause.”<br><br>Nopcsa turned warily, and slowly approached the table again.<br><br>“This isn’t going to be one of those ‘trade one of our lives for your own’ deals, is it?” Achenes began cracking her knuckles, “Because if that’s the case, count me out.”<br><br>“Oh, nothing of the sort!”  Giguere laughed dismissively. The martial artist could have swore she caught him mouthing the word, “<i>Hopefully</i>” under his mustache.<br><br>“What I’d been told is that I will die tonight, unless I hired the specific individuals that I have here. As long as all of you are on the premises, my survival is guaranteed,” Giguere leaned back in his seat, and smiled smugly, “And yes, Nopcsa, that prophecy also comes with a Maydell Shouse guarantee. There is nothing for me to worry about, because as long as we’re all here, fate itself serves as my shield. Not to indulge in the sin of hubris-“<br><br>Giguere shook his head.<br><br>“Who am I kidding? I’ve never shied away from any indulgence before. For tonight, I may as well be immortal!”</div></div>
