        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Hey guys, since we seem to all be on the same page for the revamp (in retrospect, calling it a reboot is somewhat inaccurate), I figured I'd start a new thread for us to talk about how we're going to change the cities.<br><br>Names for the cities and regions will be changed, but we'll also be tweaking the cities to provide new plot hooks in wake of the lack of Pokemon and Gym leaders to keep them fresh and interesting. However, we want to maintain the general feel of a city (especially in the Johto/Kanto regions) and the RP history they have, so we should be careful about making too massive of changes. The one exception to this is cities in the Hoenn region; they've never been RP relevant except for Slateport (which got blowed up) and Pacifidlog (because Albatross lives there), so I feel like it won't be an issue to get really creative and out there with them.<br><br>I'd like if each RPer chose to become a "steward" of a city or two, meaning they were the ones responsible for developing unique ideas for it and the like. With that said, here's a current list of cities, containing both the ones needing to be changed and the ones that are changed.<br><br>Kanto (10)<br>1 Pallet (reserved for BB)<br>2 Viridian (reserved for BB)<br>3 Pewter<br>4 Cerulean (reserved for Swingblade or Silumas or Boom)<br>5 Vermillion<br>6 Celadon<br>7 Saffron<br>8 Fuchsia<br>9 Lavender<br>10 Cinnabar<br><br>Johto (10)<br>1 New Bark<br>2 *Cherrygrove-Foehncove (Lee)<br>3 Violet<br>4 *Azalea-Hopedale (Lee)<br>5 Goldenrod (Reserved for somebody with ties to the Crescent mages)<br>6 *Ecruteak-Winstone City (Pohatu)<br>7 Olivine<br>8 Cianwood<br>9 Mahogany<br>10 Blackthorn<br><br>Hoenn (15)<br>1 Littleroot<br>2 Oldale<br>3 Petalburg<br>4 Rustboro<br>5 *Dewford-New Ellis (Lee)<br>6 *Slateport-Salcester (Lee)<br>7 Mauville<br>8 Verdanturf<br>9 Fallarbor (reserved for DL)<br>10 Lavaridge (Reserved for DL)<br>11 Fortree<br>12 Lilycove<br>13 Mossdeep<br>14 *Pacifidlog-Ha'dozen Isles (Lee)<br>15 Sootopolis<br><br>35<br><br>Threadneedle<br>Region: Kanto<br>Replacing: Lavender Town<br>Steward: Lady V<br>Threadneedle had once been planned to be the industrial capital of the Archipelago. However, its unfortunate placement at the largest convergence of leylines in the eastern hemisphere led to paranormal phenomena that drove away most workers and investors, and now all that remains is a small town surrounded by a wasteland of hulking, haunted derelicts.<br><br>Hopedale<br>“The Breadbasket of the Future”<br>Region: Johto<br>Replacing: Azalea Town<br>Steward: LeeTupper<br>A God-fearing farming community, they've used many short-sighted (but successful) agricultural techniques to bolster crop yields. Unfortunately, some of their chickens are coming home to roost...<br><br>Winstone City<br>Region: Johto<br>Steward: Pohatu<br>Replacing: Ecruteak<br>A deliberately cultivated cultural center for the Archipelago, Winstone has a thriving arts community and is resplendent with traditional architecture from all around the globe. However, these old-world aesthetics have also proven alluring for powerful individuals of sophisticated tastes and little scruples.<br><br>New Ellis<br>“Where the Whole World Meets”<br>Region: Hoenn<br>Steward: Leetupper<br>Replacing: Dewford<br>The island city through which almost all travel to the Archipelago passes, its massively diverse and chaotic populace provides haven for all manner of peoples... and schemes.<br><br>Salcester<br>“Unbroken by Sea or Sword"<br>Region: Hoenn<br>Steward: Leetupper<br>Replacing: Slateport<br>A harbor city ruined by clashing Powers almost a decade ago, it has risen from the ashes as a space-age metropolis with cutting edge technology.<br><br>The ones with names but without descriptions are ones I'm working on (Ha'dozen and Foehncove), and the reserved ones are set aside for RPers who are especially acquainted with the history for that specific city.<br><br>As a general rule of thumb, I've been assuming that when the Archipelago was settled by the US in the 1940's, each region had a specific quirk.<br>*Kanto was mostly developed as an economic powerhouse to compete with the rising powers in Asia, with many industrial cities and shipping ports.<br>*Johto was developed as an attempt to develop idealized cities from scratch, taking the reconstruction in Europe a step further. Their communities are each designed for aesthetic perfection, and frequently tribute the ideals of other societies. (For example, Foehncove is an idealized version of a New England beach city like Martha's Vineyard, Hopedale is an attempt at the perfect farming community, and Winstone is designed to be European style metropolis, full of cafes and museums.)<br>*Hoenn was the most experimental region, with social engineers trying to develop all sorts of "space age" communities that they've never had a chance to experiment with in a vacuum. Some of these experiments have gone well, and others, not so much.<br><br>I've yet to rename the regions, but I think we'll wait until we've overhauled the cities to do that. Best to get a general feel for our namings and aesthetics before we pin names on the whole kit and kaboodle. That said, I welcome everybody's input! Let's make this a world we can all be proud of!<br><br><br><br><div class="post_attachments"><b>Attachments:</b><br><br><blockquote><a href="/attachment/download/26"><img src="http://s28638.storage.proboards.com/3328638/t/L5AbXLkShtci1F8EuiKG.png" alt="Archipelago Map Big2.png"></a><br><br></blockquote></div></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">But how many cities actually have relevant ORP history? If we were to do a soft reboot - and it's a great idea - then I would push to eliminate as any cities as possible and stick to a minimum handful that will give enough different launching points. I'd also try to cut down on as much landmass as possible. Okay, okay, my dream is to just relocate it all to a few made-up islands around the area of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland.<br><br>Oh, hey guys.<br><br><b>EDIT:</b> "Threadneedle" and "Salcester" are great names by the way.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Yoshimitsu</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Pohatu makes a good point - outside of personal interest, there are only a handful of areas that have any significance nowadays. Talking 'recent' RPs, it's basically just Ecruteak (Mahogany got a mention I think). Go back a bit further? Blanks are drawn. Go back into legacy (but still very important) stuff, you start hitting Slateport and Goldenrod. I'll be honest and say that the best I remember and knew about before that was like... Saffron City was apparently a bit roughed up by... Sly maybe? Mew?<br><br>(Not talking about characters residing in any cities, just plots that would cause the cities to be put on the map. Maybe my memory is shit! I just don't know)</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">TBH, I hadn't really thought about eliminating cities, but that might be a good idea to ditch a few. I wouldn't want to cut it down too much, though, but I'd be very much on board with cutting a half dozen of the cities that nobody ever uses. I know DL is combining Fallarbor and Lavaridge into a single town, which on its surface seems pretty humdrum, but has a sinister and eccentric cult carrying on with a second city hidden beneath the first, so that'd put us down to 34 technically.<br><br>As for which cities have an RP history:<br>-Cherrygrove is the big good-guy hub.<br>-Slateport was wrecked by Summoners.<br>-Goldenrod had a huge presence of powers until the Snitz or so.<br>-Olivine is where the Summoners live.<br>-Cerulean was the Cherrygrove of the early 2000's, with Wudge, Misty, Kuro, Swingblade, etc. all sticking around there.<br>-Celadon has quite a bit of history. It's where Helen's from, where most of the lesser Summoner/Cherrygrove skirmishes took place, and probably is going to metamorphose into Archipelago!vegas, so it sticks around.<br>-Viridian was the main city for TR vs. Alliance vs. Crescent Mage action.<br>-Ecruteak had an ishkabibble or something.<br>-Violet's actually almost had more action than Cherrygrove, with an alien invasion, multiple heists, and the first part of Triannual all taking place there.<br><br>That said, I've never seen anything relevant done with Pewter, Fuchsia, Cianwood, or the unreserved portions of Hoenn, so I don't think there'd be much in the way of hard feelings to axing a few of them. I wouldn't want to go below twenty five cities, but I'm amenable to dropping a few.<br><br>My main goal with the archipelago is to make it a great hub for adventures. I don't want RPs to have to Kevin-out (y'all remember how Kevin's RPs always took place in indeterminate locations because nothing in the Archipelago really fit). I want RPs to take place in locations around the world, but I want to encourage writers to focus on the region.<br><br>Yoshimitsu once compared Hector to having a face full of fishhooks, and I want the archipelago to be like that with plot-hooks. Like the moment they look into the Exodus, they get a face full of dozens of plot-hooks and story ideas instantly. I feel like every city should lend itself to specific genres and styles, so if an author wants to do a crime plot, they can instantly go "Winstone, I can tie this into the Mafia intrigue!" or if they want to get into supernatural horror, they've got Threadneedle already set up.<br><br>Essentially, there are two things I really want to do with this revamp:<br>-Prevent continuity lockout for newbies, making it easier to jump in without knowing decades of history.<br>-Make it easier to interconnect characters and plots.<br><br>So keeping everybody in a mostly contained area, with RPs in the larger world being exceptions instead of the rule, would be conducive to a healthy and active Role Playing community.<br><br>All that said, welcome back, Pohatu! Your wit and charisma have been sorely missed.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">As for size and location of the archipelago, the tentative map I uploaded was reckoned at somewhere between 200 and 500 miles to a side, so we're probably talking about as much landmass as... Well, maybe Hawaii or so? That might be a little too large. I do want it large enough though that crossing the region isn't a simple matter, like it should be a several hour drive to get from the far side of Kanto to the edge of Johto. So maybe 200 miles across is about right? I might be willing to go somewhat smaller than that, though, as long as we still have room for countryside between our cities and towns.<br><br>As for location, I'm pretty sure we've well established the Archipelago is in the Pacific with heavy Japanese influence, so I don't think we could flip over to the other side of the Americas. That said, we could move it a bit. I could see maybe moving to around where Midway island is or so, without it being an issue. (Farther east, and we'd be running into "why wasn't it a state already?")</div></div>

And yet by that reasoning, it feels like it'd be both easier and more effective to just coin some new cities and areas around various genre themes rather than trying to pin down a new-canon equivalent for every Pokemon city that's ever been relevant to ORP. Just because an old story took place in, like, Viridian City, I don't think we need to bend over backward to make sure there's a 1:1 replacement for that location. In the remote event that we need to refer to those plot events, we can just handwave the location to whichever city is most appropriate in the new canon.<br><br>I don't know, I'm just arguing because it's fun, you guys probably won't see that as a wrenching break from character.<br></div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">I think the key thing to remember is that we don't want to start cutting before we know what's worth saving. I'd say give this project a month to fill out the cities, tentatively, and whatever hasn't turned up by the second week of November can just go. As is, a third of the historically relevant cities are revamped (Ecruteak, Cherrygrove, Slateport), and another third (Violet, Goldenrod, and Celadon) are all close to being revamped by El and I. I doubt we'll go over twenty five cities, if we're only keeping the very best ideas, but it's good to have that wiggle room.<br><br>As for Magic, yeah, we'd need a Magic-pedia, and probably a Race-pedia, just so that codified information is easily accessible.<br>For magic styles, we'd need Silumas' new style, Miko's Jade Magic, Esther's word magic (possibly? Not sure if it's unique to her, or can be taught), Helen's two unique schools, whatever BB refluffs a few of the shin-ra styles into, and I think that's about it for right now? <br>As for Races, we've got Summoners, Draken, Drakyan Elves, Raiixians, Gelhaim, and I'm not sure if there's any other big relevant species besides off the top of my head.<br>Both of these are good to have, but nowhere as important as a list of cities and history, so they'll probably wait for a little while.<br><br>Also, another revamp:<br>Gulo<br>"The Backbone of the Archipelago"<br>Region: Johto<br>Replacing: Blackthorn<br>Steward: LeeTupper (for now)<br>This mining town on the slope of the Archipelago's highest peak takes advantage of unique geological formations found nowhere else in the world.

End to end, at interstate speeds, that's a trip of less than three hours. (Is that a long distance to you people? I have no perspective.) I would err more on the side of approximately 500 miles, especially if we're going to have all three regions, or at least most of all three regions. Travel between cities should be a not-insignificant thing. <br><br>But, in the interest of not making inter-city travel prohibitively difficult or time-consuming...<br><br>...<i>WHAT IF</i>...<br><br>...we implemented the <b>Magnet Train</b>? A series of maglev trains between the most significant cities (Slateport/Goldenrod/Saffron, maybe a couple others). It would allow characters to travel without overly slowing the plot but would still allow for expansion into the underdeveloped (world-building-wise) cities and the countryside, and it would lend depth to the world. If we condense it too much, if travel doesn't pose more than a cursory obstacle, then it might as well just be one really big sprawling city instead of separate ones. Our aim should be less Manhattan, more Hawaii or part of Japan. <br><br>That said, I agree with Pohatu in that there doesn't need to be a 1:1 substitution. The canonically important cities should remain more or less the same, geographically. The rest we can take liberties with, using the original Kanto/Johto/Hoenn archipelago as a guideline rather than a blueprint.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">SV raises a good point but I'd like to chip in on a different note.<br><br>Even 500 miles seems a tad small insofar as people who enjoy quest plots go - while this amount of space does allow for things like ancient ruins and secret underground cave systems and the like, it potentially may result in one of two things. Either people end up rehashing the same areas too many times to a point where it's highly unlikely that secret underground satanic ritual dungeon that's been explored six times already would have yet <i>another</i> hidden staircase leading to the ultimate jewel of prehensile hair control, integral to the RPer's plot and character growth, OR it becomes logistically impossible for this landmass to have any more unexplored locations for characters to stumble across/require to explore. Even if you guesstimate that every unexplored location is approximately 20 squared miles in size (being a bit generous, but hey ho), it still puts a pretty heavy restriction on how many quest-potential locations can exist which could cause issues for those of us who require such locations that wouldn't suit being found in the rest of the globe.<br><br>I'm not saying it needs to be continent-sized but I feel like there needs to be more potential space for stuff like this for people who like the quest-style RPs (myself, Kevin, Kara and Steph spring to mind)<br><br>Not sure if I've made my point clearly enough (it's like 8am and I've been up since 5 so my brain's a bit bluhhh give me sleep), but feel free to ask for clarification.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">If we're talking 500 miles, then we're talking a region approximately the size of New York state. That said, it could be doable, especially if we go with SV's Luxury Trainride Forever idea. : 3 Mind you, this would also allow for more decompressed cities and the like, which fits with flavor of most things being "suburban" seeming. It's likely each city has a core "metropolis" that's ten to twenty miles across, and then suburbs of varying size.<br><br>Of course, when it comes to quests, walking distance and time is worth noting as well. The average person can put away 30 miles in a day, easily, and I don't think I've seen more than three or four RPs in my whole time writing where an RP actually justified taking "multiple days" to happen. So I'm for making the Archipelago a bit on the bigger side, but I don't think we'd necessarily need to make it titanic.<br><br>(Tl:dr; I'm leaning towards bigger but I could go either way on this one.)</div></div>

Either people end up rehashing the same areas too many times to a point where it's highly unlikely that secret underground satanic ritual dungeon that's been explored six times already would have yet <i>another</i> hidden staircase leading to the ultimate jewel of prehensile hair control, integral to the RPer's plot and character growth, OR it becomes logistically impossible for this landmass to have any more unexplored locations for characters to stumble across/require to explore. Even if you guesstimate that every unexplored location is approximately 20 squared miles in size (being a bit generous, but hey ho), it still puts a pretty heavy restriction on how many quest-potential locations can exist which could cause issues for those of us who require such locations that wouldn't suit being found in the rest of the globe.<br><br>I'm not saying it needs to be continent-sized but I feel like there needs to be more potential space for stuff like this for people who like the quest-style RPs (myself, Kevin, Kara and Steph spring to mind)<br><br>Not sure if I've made my point clearly enough (it's like 8am and I've been up since 5 so my brain's a bit bluhhh give me sleep), but feel free to ask for clarification.<div class="quote_clear"></div></div></div><br><br>And there's no reason that certain quests/story lines couldn't take place outside the Archipelago.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Actually, I already have an idea on how to do things in a very simple and intuitive manner.<br><br>I'm going to put together a paragraph long description of the archipelago, and then beneath it, have three short descriptions of each region. Beneath each will be a spoiler tag with "Click to learn about the cities" or something like that. Nested inside those spoiler tags will be a list of two line summaries of each city, like you can read here, each with a nested spoiler tag with a more expansive, two or three paragraph writeup for each city and the relevant entities to know of. (There'll probably being a disclaimer at the start of the topic that you only need to expand and read through the first spoiler tags (city summaries) to understand the setting, and that the more in depth stuff only matters for people writing plots in that city proper.<br><br>As for size, yeah, bigger than 500 miles would be excessive. We've got mountain ranges, several islands, and you can go on quests all over the world, that's fully viable. In fact, I'd almost say quests are the one kind of plot I'd prefer didn't happen in the Archipelago, just because going elsewhere adds to the sense of adventure and mystery that are the best parts of quest plots. I'd say I'm leaning for somewhere between 300 and 500 miles, give or take, though smaller could still work. (Actually, 300 sounds really good to me, for some reason?)<br><br>Finally, what's everybody's opinion on the "Lost World" island? The plot I want to do doesn't need to change status quo forever, so if you guys don't like the idea, I can just have it be a temporary thing. : 3</div></div>

Archipelago 1.0 had three different regions because Pokemon. But really what we're doing here is condensing them and bringing them together.

You've mentioned wanting the keep the cities and region thematic, but you've got to remember that this isn't Starwars.  There's not going to be a city that is swarming with creatures of the night who pray upon the citizens of the city with a population that is going to stay.  Sure there can be certain segments of a city or small town that is now abandoned that could fit the role but to try to make a whole city around that theme is stretching at best.  We should try to keep to maybe 5 large, diverse cities that can serve as catch-alls for plot and then if we need to we can create towns on the fly that meet our needs with the space we have.  For instance, my claimed areas aren't going to be very large at all, the biggest being about 200 permanent residents, and I feel like that is about perfect.</div></div>

        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">I think you're underestimating what the archipelago <i>is</i>, DL. I mean, how many people willingly choose to live in Siberia? Alaska? The outback of Australia? Not to mention high-risk, high-reward coastal cities that are booming with business and regularly get hammered with hurricanes (See: Florida).<br><br>I'm not saying most cities are going to be "vampire city" or the like. Threadneedle is iffy, but on the other hand, some people like the privacy of living in a small town, the fact that massive tracts of uninhabited property let them set up a home pretty much anywhere, and the fact that they can afford a huge plot of land and live like kings only a short commute from some of the biggest economic powerhouses in the Archipelago. And that's just the mundane reasons; a convergence of leylines means mages get a huge amount of bang for their buck when it comes to spellcasting there, and psychics and sensitives probably also receive a substantial power boost. Maybe even some folks choose to live there because they've lost loved ones, and it makes it easier to get in touch (...or at least communicate with something CLAIMING to be their beloved).<br><br>As a whole, the Archipelago is "Deadliest Catch" land. Things are substantially more dangerous than living stateside, but you're also situated in a hub that's directly between several of the largest economies in the world (China, United States, Japan, Russia, India). On top of that, the Archipelago has some of the most advanced technology in the world, and is an absolutely gorgeous region to boot.<br><br>This isn't even getting into how the Archipelago is a wild-west style frontier compared to much of the world, and a lot of people who end up there are doing so because it's the only place they can safely disappear to. <br><br>There are a few cities with some... dubious things going on (Threadneedle, Merc's city Empyrea that came up in the chat last night, DL's pair), but they're exceptions and not the rule. In each case, the people living there have a reason (Threadneedle mostly isn't <i>that</i> bad, just a little creepy, unless you go looking for trouble. Empyrea (City? Not sure on the full name yet) is fully climate controlled and has the best technology and healthcare in the entire world. And DL's pair are pretty much entirely populated by cultists, who don't really mind what's going on.)<br><br>The other cities do have odd things going on, but they're a side-dish, not the main event. Sure, Winstone's got organized crime, but we're mostly playing it up because that's what writers will focus on. I highly doubt their problems with the Mafia are even as bad as say, what Chicago or NYC needs to deal with in real life. Hopedale's aggressive agriculture has led to the city being surrounded by an unnaturally robust forest and a slightly higher rate of cancer, but that's not things that the general population is going to fret all that much about.<br><br>(I don't think I'm really... debating with anybody? I'm just kinda gushing about the general cultural mood in the setting. : 3 )</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">As for actual formalized name for the Archipelago, considering that the region was formally settled in the wake of WW2 (though it seems some small populations preceded this), I'd almost be inclined to go with the name of some big-deal Pacific Theater commander, like MacArthur, Nimitz, or Halsey. That said, I'm not seeing many names that really have the "right" ring to them, so I'm still kinda ambivalent. If we do come up with a name we all like, it could be handwaved with that being the name of some fictional commander who encouraged the United States to formally take control of it. <br><br>Monmorency sounds nice. Not sure if it'd be the Archipelago, or one of the cities. I could see it being a good name for Celadon 2.0, which is basically Archipelago Vegas. (Of course, then again, out of that list, Monmorency is probably the closest thing to what I could see being a real name for the Archipelago.) Paymarble feels like a spot on name too, though I'm not sure what city would best adopt that name.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Reyskimmer has such a nice sound to it, at least to me. I'd say def stick with that. Not sure how to feel about Brightmeadow... technically I lean more towards naming it with something that has an interesting green color sound to it (if you want ideas, I've got tons; being a fan of RWBY, I have a lot of info on odd color names).<br><br>Now it's my turn to finally unload revamp details... and give the Archipelago-verse version of Todoroki =<br><br><b>~~~~~~~ The Todoroki Isles ~~~~~~~</b><br><br><u>Overview</u>: A trio of islands steeped in ancient history full of tales of epic battles, adventures, and tragedies; currently possesses many relics of both buildings and other amazing artifacts from the past, some valuable enough to attract thieves and other unwanted visitors. This gave rise to the government hiring well-paid "Treasure Acquisitors" to hunt for relics to preserve them for museums and historical research facilities, while taking a strong stand against any thieving creeps they might come across on their travels. And as deeply connected to history as most inhabitants of the islands are, they also greatly love the newest technologies and try decorating or altering the appearance of many devices with inspiration from the past. Additional, the islands are known for magical creatures that inhabit all 3 isles that go by the collective name of "Spirikin". Each of these beings has the power to transform themselves into a spirit-like form that can reside in precious stones referred to as "Spirithysts", and can remain inside of them in a stasis unaffected by the ravages of time itself (so literally if you find a Spirithyst that is like hundreds of years old, and somehow release the Spirikin inside, they'll be the same age and vitality as when they first entered it - almost like being immortal). Spirikin lead normal lives in the various environments they call home on the islands and often are both beneficial or trouble to the islanders. However... if they come to trust and befriend someone strongly enough, and if that person has a Spirithyst of the color according to whatever dominant power the Spirikin has, their bond allows the Spirkin to transfer themselves into the Spirithyst and let their comrade summon them from it whenever they're needed (like Pokemon from a pokeball). A bond that isn't even broken by death, in some cases (it's been learned in recent years that an ancient Spirikin will be fiercely loyal to the descendant of a former ally).<br><br><u>Largest Isle/Most Populated</u>: <b>Kamineko</b><br><br><u>Info About Its Name:</u> Inspired from the collective nickname that was given in ancient times to the most valiant and well-known of Spirikin on the island, the powerful catlike creatures called Dynalion, Boltiger, Seaval, Auraguar, Poisanther, Shadynx, and Crysleofledge.<br><br><u>2nd Largest Isle/Hub of Trade &amp; Commerce</u>: <b>Solvista</b><br><br><u>Third Isle/Least Populated &amp; Best-preserved Ruins</u>: <b>Lunarjade</b><br><br><b>~~~ I will give more details on the islands themselves at a later date... this is all I can post for now...</b> *sweatdrop*</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Well, we are now more than a stone's throw from Japan- The current real world location I've been giving for the Archipelago is Midway island, roughly. The backstory I've been going with is it seemingly appeared out of nowhere either during (or shortly before) WW2 and was claimed by Japan at the time, until the United States won the war (well, won the war in the Pacific Theater, <i>pedants</i>) and claimed it as a territory of theirs. Perplexingly, there was quite a few people found in the area who insisted their family's been in the region for decades, even though there's no record of the Archipelago existing before the 1930's (Popular opinion states that these people were lying just to stake claim on the territory, but it's possible they're telling the truth). (I want to leave the Archipelago's backstory open to all sorts of possibilities; it could have been created by a Power, which is what the cult in Lincliff believes, or could have arisen from volcanic activity, or more exotically, could possibly have bled over from a timeline/universe where it DID exist into the current universe, considering how frequently bleed-over from other universes happens in ORP.)<br><br>This means the closest real world location with actual clout would be Hawaii, though I'm not sure how much people would want to Hawaiify it. (This does create a slight plothole of how in Triannual, when the group stepped through the card, the time was significantly different in Hawaii, but I digress)<br><br>If you look at the demographics of Hawaii, roughly 25% considers themselves to be of Japanese origins, and the Archipelago is likely quite close to that.<br><br>(I've been debating on the demographic makeup of the archipelago- Just spitballing, I came up with 20% Japanese, 25% American Caucasians, 10% white people from other destinations (mostly Europe), 10% other Asian populations (Chinese, Filipino, Korean), 15% Black (maybe a bit higher; it honestly seems like the Archipelago has quite a substantial black population from what we've seen on screen), 10% Hispanic/Latino, and 10% various other groups (Middle Eastern, Pacific Islander, etc.)) Of course, this isn't accounting for the non-human population, where we'd dip into Raiixians, Elves, and so forth. (I still don't know if non-humans are accorded citizenship and rights like humans are?)</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">LeeTupper</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Of course, this also gets into how the Archipelago is something of the ultimate economic and strategic holding; after all, it's directly between China and the US, and close to several other major world powers (Japan, the Koreas, Canada, so forth) That largely explains all the strife over it; control the Archipelago, and you've got an island full of Powers under your control, the best shipping location in possibly the entire world, AND a huge strategic edge (This is why the Summoners sent Miko- Their plan was to take control of the Archipelago. Once Miko obtained Bagan, their plan was to raze the Archipelago (or at least a lot of the seats of power in the region), convince the Powers to rebel, and then basically use the Archipelago as a base for the Summoners to take the whole world hostage (or at least China, Russia, and the United States) until they'd amassed enough power to become uncontested dictators.<br><br>Unfortunately for the Summoners, Guile beat up Miko as America's vengeance for the Slateport Incident, so he had to go home and become a family man.

The streets are largely cobbled in brick, and the homes are primarily  <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Cod_(house)" target="_blank">Capes</a>.

Powers are treated as minor celebrities, and it's not uncommon for the local tabloids to keep tabs on all of their comings and goings. This fame isn't without a price however; expectations of Powers run high, and they're expected to constantly be interceding in emergencies and conflicts.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">i learned a lot about mapmaking and geography when redoing the Aleta one, so if you wanna touch things up a bit in the name of realism, one thing to keep in mind is that rivers generally don't split and they never go from coast to coast. Usually there is a distinct lowest point where a body of water is and it will always choose that direction, give or take some meandering. On the flip side, rivers love joining together.<br><br>Exceptions to this are deltas like the Mississippi or the Nile, and they flow out because the outlet is a flat, boggy area. Rivers also squiggle based on elevation--the steeper the elevation and thus the faster the water is moving, means straighter rivers while flatter terrain means super windy rivers and probably lots of bow lakes.<br><br>A lake with no outflow to the ocean results in lots of mineral deposits which gives you places like the Great Salt Lake.<br><br>Judging from the island chain running from the northwest corner to the southeast, you probably have a tectonic plate actively subducting so you could have a craggy mountain range through the Lincliff area and volcanos and shit. Unsure if there's an active plate boundary also under the biggest island, but if there is, I'd imagine the mountain range would run a bit longer. If the island was built elsewhere and migrated to its current position, I'd still imagine the mountain range to be a bit longer, though weathered, since the island would have had to survive a millennia of erosion.<br><br>IIRC, prevailing winds at this latitude blow from east to west. Maybe when I get home I will think about drawing the weather diagram, which informs rainfall and whatnot.<br><br>Those are just some thoughts on future iterations, though I get that realism isn't really necessary so feel free to just throw them away. Still a dope map.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Certain ideas that we'd established for uninhabited islands:<br>-Drinker Island: A desolate island with a dormant volcano in its center. It's barely visited by the authorities, making it a favored party locale for teens. However, mysteriously, various extinct creatures have been spotted on occasion. Due to the nature of the crowds there, however, these sightings are treated with pretty much no real credibility. Ironically, it was named after its discoverer, not the constant binging in the present day.<br>-I kinda like the idea of some island that's nothing but an immense library of a potpourri of subjects. Like a lighthouse of Alexandria thing. Not sure where we'd put it though- And it might be redundant with the Crescent Mage library? But still, think of how cool of an idea that would be!<br>-There should be an island that keeps giving troubling hints that it's alive, and people try to avoid it because they're afraid of waking it up. (Okay, this might be a bit outlandish, but I kinda dig the "predatory island"/turtle island concept. A lot.)<br>-One of the stops in Summoner Style was an island that negates the powers and magic of everybody on it (basically, it's a titanic mana-sink). I'm not sure if we want that anywhere near the Archipelago though? It's probably unhealthy as hell to be near, since it slowly drained the life force of anybody on it. But I get a feeling Williams would see about establishing a prison there?</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message"><b>Shoheki-cho</b> (Replacing Goldenrod)<br><br>A mainland city, and a hub of activity. Being one of the biggest cities of the Archipelago, it has business, it has tourism and it has recreation. It's widely known for being the site of the battle against Pandora and the sacrifice of one young girl who gave her life to save the entire world. A statue was erected close to, but not on, the site of the final battle. The site of the final battle remained left in its ruined state as a tribute.<br><br>Population: 1,000,000<br>Terrain: Shoheki-cho was built as a city. While it follows the natural rise and dip of the hills, it's mainly a flat area that is made up of concrete and tarmac. The buildings have elements of their original architecture, but the interiors have been modernized as per demand, nowadays. It's mostly tall buildings with small parks dotted around, and the outskirts have the buildings shrink slightly for the residential areas (mostly rent-only).<br><br>Society: It's a social hub of the Archipelago with a massive tourism trade. It has the typical tourist trademarks that are tributes to Times Square and Shibuya Crossing, so every other person there is a tourist who wants to visit the area. The residents of the area are relatively open-minded and accepting of this, and of Powers, since their lives were saved thanks to a small group of Powers. The society runs itself, outside of tourism, with major technology companies based in the area and the almost self-managing retail pulling in the big business. The city, as a whole, has superstitions regarding the still-ruined area that once housed the Crescent Mage Library, and barely anyone stops by to look at it any more.<br><br>Important Locations:<br>- Crescent Mage Library Ruins. While the only people who visit are typically tourists wanting to see the site, not many stay longer than a few minutes. Some of the mystically-versed tend to linger, but even they disappear rather quickly. Local superstition say the area is taboo, mystical for some reason and it's an area that even the hardiest of veterans feel unease when visiting.<br>- Memorial Statue. A statue erected to celebrate the young girl who played a part, and gave her life, to save the city. It is always kept in pristine condition, even by the kids who were born after the cataclysm that nearly ruined the city. It's not uncommon for people to lay flowers by the statue as their own way of paying tribute.<br>- Residential Area. Mostly on the outskirts of the city, though there are pockets within the city itself. Rent in the city is extortionate, and it's not exactly cheap on the outskirts but it is an affordable rate providing the average person didn't mind putting in extra hours at their job.<br>- Commercial District. The shopping area. While not limited to this area, what with shops and streets of shops intersperced across the city, this is the most successful and highly visited shopping area of the city. From thrift to high-street to couture, old technology like phonograms and record players to the newest phones and television sets, this is the place to get it.<br>- Business District. Adjacent to the Commercial District, this is the SRS BSNS area of the city. As expected, it has the tallest buildings and the older architecture, closer to the centre of the city. Inside the buildings were not just typical office buildings, but research and development labs, testing facilities and on-site gyms for most of the companies operating.<br>Location: Mainland.

        <div class="content"><div class="message">There is actually some precedent for this, going all the way back to 2007! I Ketut Topan ("Tut" for short) is an Indonesian pirate, though more of a modern-day AK-47 and rocket launcher type, and he was established as having ties in the region. Not sure if he'd work as a high-ranking individual, but he's got ties to the Fascere Order (a group that provides mystical artifacts to grant powers), and last time he was seen on screen, he was stocking up on mystical weaponry designed for killing Powers.</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">Also, Hopewell or whatever the heck I called it, the Azalea analogue with the genetic engineering and super-crops and all, is now Greffant Village. (Figured it was fitting to have another town with a French name, considering the Archipelago was largely settled by allies in the wake of WWII. I'm kinda liking the idea that due to the high French presence, there's actually a large number of immigrants from a variety of French speaking countries, like Haiti, portions of Africa, etc.)(See: Renard, Thyra, possibly Channery, so forth)</div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">I can and would love to work with all of that. If you linked me to the story of portions of Orps that you use or talk about Tut, I'd read up and try incorporating him into the islands current power structure. He sounds awesome for one of the pirate lords, or even like a lieutenant or something for one of the other lords.<br><br>Addition: I want the larger islands and towns to function like rowdy/bustling sea ports each with a distinct flavor depending on which Pirate lord rules which port, but still have lots of small islands and out of the way places that very greatly in flavor because they've been settled by so many societal outcasts. There could be a demon summoning/worshipping cult on an island, and a bunch of weed growing hippies right next door on another island. Lots of them pay up to the pirate lords, but some of the islands go completely unnoticed.  </div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message">I think this is one of the big advantages our setting has over OP, in that we've got room for all sorts of pirates (modern, classic, fantastic,sci fi) and it makes a lot of sense they'd be out in force, since the archipelago has been established as the shipping hub of the entire hemisphere.<br>There's probably some sort of deal with the devil involved somewhere there, keeping the authorities and buccaneers in balance. like maybe the pirates are given free reign to pick off smugglers and summoner and criminals, and exchange for that service, the authorities allow them to hit a certain quota of legit businesses as well.</div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">addison</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Exactly! Oh Yes. Each 'faction' of Pirates will have very distinct feels. Perhaps a powers only pirate lord and faction, a magic tools/modern day pirate lord and faction, and legit business merchant with a lot of weight and money (high tech pirates?) that is a Pirate lord just to keep some balance. I don't understand enough about summoners and powers to incorporate them, but I'm starting to get there. I hate locking anything down in my head because I'm just so uncertain of existing canon and pervious story lines. </div></div>

        <div class="content"><div class="message"><b>Greffant Village</b><br>Pronounced: Gref-FAHNT (French)<br>A farming town that uses a multitude of cutting edge agricultural techniques to guarantee them the greatest crop yields in the entire world. However, these untested techniques have been proving to have some unforseen consequences.<br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler4337356').toggle();if($('#spoiler4337356').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler4337356">Population: 12,000<br>Terrain: Surrounded by the immense Dents de Peigne Forest on all sides, Greffant is largely isolated from the hustle and bustle of the Archipelago as a whole. The village itself is mostly well-sized farming homes with a small main drag for shopping, with rolling fields and complexes of greenhouses out to edge of the towering woods.  There are a few squat cinderblock buildings hidden in the quieter corners of the village, where scientists busily work away on their next innovations.<br>Society: <br>Important Locations:<br>+Dents de Peigne Forest: A massive forest of gigantic trees (easily the size of redwoods, with some even larger than that), it encircles Greffant. There are only two roads through it, one going from Paymarble to Greffant, and the other from Greffant to Brightmeadow. It's frequently avoided by travelers, are there are many reports of mysterious phenomenas and sightings of non-human entities. Scientific testing has found that the forest actually predates the Archipelago (which current theories say emerged from the ocean in the 1940's) by hundreds of years.<br>Farmers who live near the edge of the forest frequently leave offerings by their crops, claiming that it appeases some unseen society of elves/fey that dwells in the depths of the primordial wood.<br>+<br>Important People:<br>+Maude: The Summoner expatriate Maude makes her home in the trees of Dents de Peigne, constructing lean-tos and hammocks hundreds of feet above the forest floor, and living off of what she can glean from the harvests and "elf offerings" from the local farmers. She's occasionally seen by villagers when they're passing through. They've dubbed this pale figure they see flitting through the canopy "The Maiden's Ghost", always attaching some story of a gristly happening to explain why she haunts the deep woods.<br>Unique Species:<br>Due to genetic engineering, Greffant Village boasts a host of species found nowhere else in the world.<br>*La Porteurs de Miel/Honeyhawks: These immense honeybees (roughly the side of a man's fist) are a common sight throughout town. Though alarming at first, these insects are actually quite tame and even affectionate, and will gladly eat offered sweets. Though commonly referred to as "stingless", they actually do have proportionate stingers, but have been engineered to lack the muscles to extend said stingers. They live in building sized hives, kept on trailers and moved around the village to help pollinate the crops.<br>*The Greffant Imperial: A butterfly engineered to have striping on their wings resembling the French flag. Their larva subsist entirely on weeds and other unwanted plants, and the adults have been engineered to be attracted only to a specific scent present in the flowers of Greffant's crop. They're viewed as the emblem for Greffant, and deliberately harming one actually counts as a misdemeanor under local law. Almost every year, there's a moral panic when a few misguided Imperials are spotted in Garden's Well, with the populace there claiming this'll be the year where they settle down there and become an invasive species.<br>*The Giant Ichneumons: These are much more a figure of urban legend than any confirmed reality, but almost every resident has claimed to see one at some point. These cat-sized parasitic wasps are believed to paralyze large mammalian pests (groundhogs, raccoons, rats, etc.)  and use their still living bodies to incubate their flesh eating larvae. Despite the certainty of the town that they exist, there's been no confirmed scientific evidence of them.<br>Location: <br>Relevant RPs: <br>Trivia:<br>+People from Greffant Village are referred to as "Greffantien" or "Les Greffantiens" as a group. Brightfeldians infamously have collectively nicknamed people from Greffant Village "Frenchy", however.<br>+Greffant Village typically doesn't deal much with other cities in the Archipelago, except for shipping ridiculously large produce to them. The only cities they regularly deal with are Brightmeadow, which frequently exchanges their meat and egg products for feed for their livestock, and Garden's Well, that views their bioengineering of plants to be borderline blasphemous. As such, Brightfeldians have an affectionate relationship with Greffant, seeing it as the only other city of "real farmers" in the Archipelago. On the other hand, Garden's Well, where traditional horticulture is viewed as artform, will have nothing to do whatsoever with Greffant Village. There is no quicker way to get slapped in Garden's Well than asking "Oh, did you get that from Greffant?"<br></div><br><br>Will finish on my lunch break.<br></div></div>
