    <h1>Muddy Season [Yoonfic!]</h1>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Beelzebibble</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message"><i>The Mole resumes over the weekend, but first, I'm close enough to finishing the latter sections of this story that I can go ahead and post the earlier ones. So begins a weeklong Yoonfic event. On each day, I'll post one of the five parts of the story, finishing on Friday. Let some familiar ORP characters as well as some new faces handle the deceit and treachery for a week, and then you guys can get back into it yourselves, huh?</i><br><br><br>* * *<br><br><br><i>Two years before the present day<br>Felice Potabile</i><br><br>A flickering, faintly humming lamp over a secluded table.<br><br>“Well, sir, I’d hate to think you might not have our own governor’s best interests at heart. It’s always a shame, isn’t it, around this time, when the very citizens who elected an official in the first place turn around and scrabble everywhere to pull the rug out from under his feet?”<br><br>The visitor, a man of gray hair and goatee, his heavy-set form obscured by a long coat, propped an elbow on the table. “‘Scuse me, I’m not trying to be rude,” he said, “but you think we could speed through the cutesy rhetorical stuff? It’s just, I already had to put up with that routine once tonight, and it didn’t get me anywhere.”<br><br>“From <i>her</i>, you mean.”<br><br>“Yeah. Not trying to be rude,” the visitor repeated, “I mean, like I said – but she lays it on pretty thick and I want to really just keep this to the point. And for the record,” he added, raising a flattened palm, “my employer didn’t vote for Northcutt and neither did I.”<br><br>“I understand completely,” said Franklin Gaussier.<br><br><br><div align="center"><img style="max-width: 100%;" src="http://i322.photobucket.com/albums/nn433/asgardreid/gaussier.png"></div><br><br>He was a middle-aged man with sharp eyebrows, a cleft chin, and a thinned hairline, and if he took any offense at the visitor’s words, his face betrayed it not a bit. His intent-bordering-upon-eager smile didn’t waver in the least. “The darkest, most damning information I can divulge on Abraham Northcutt, and no sardonic commentary. Well, you’re in luck. It happens I’ve been sitting on a nice piece about Northcutt for quite some time now. Always knew someone would come in around this season and pick it up…” Gaussier scratched his cheek with a thumb. “I’ll part with it for two hundred dollars, if you’ve got that much on you.”<br><br>The visitor gave an only half-restrained sigh of relief. “Finally, someone talking sense!” he breathed. “Do you know, she was gonna charge me two <i>thousand</i> for what she had to say about him? That’s when I walked out on her. As if my employer’s funding me enough to sink two grand into an open question like that.”<br><br>“What this tells us,” said Gaussier, “is that you actually have an idea of how to dispense your money, for which congratulations, sir, because too few people in your position do. You’re the realists. The rest of them get taken in by myth and celebrity. They never wonder if in all these years an alternative hasn’t shown up. Well, I’m the alternative, and I happen to know what a competitive price is. Just let her go on thinking she’s got a monopoly as long as she likes! To those for whom her fees are too exorbitant, I offer…” He trailed off under the sound of paper sliding across the table. The double likeness of another Franklin stared up at him.<br><br>The visitor remarked: “I hope you were going to say you’ll offer my money’s worth.”<br><br>Gaussier folded the bills into his robust wallet and assured the visitor he would.<br><br>“Can I ask you a favor, though?” asked the visitor. “Will you give me the CliffsNotes version first and <i>then</i> lay the whole thing out? I want to know where you’re going with the, you know, the minutiae.”<br><br>“I don’t see any reason why not. Here it is, then. The darkest secret.” Gaussier glanced around the dingy, mostly vacant bar before muttering: “It’s been Governor Northcutt’s habit for the past several years to consort with a certain prostitute.”<br><br>The visitor’s eyes widened, but he maintained a cautious, deliberate tone with his next words; his crevassed cheeks held steady as his mouth formed: “On whose authority can you claim that?”<br><br>“On the… well, on the pimp’s, sir.” <br><br>“Excuse me?”<br><br>“You see, for a while now, I’ve been putting down top dollar for access to the kind of records kept in <i>that</i> part of town. Just about as long as I’ve been in the business, actually.” Gaussier tapped his fork on the tabletop, out of habit rather than as a discreet signal. “And the Governor’s name has been cropping up in their registers since long before then. Now—”<br><br>But the visitor cut him off.<br><br>“I think two hundred dollars earned me more than that. My contractor and I aren’t going to level this kind of accusation at Northcutt based on nothing more than the word of an informant – no offense. And as much as I’d like to just check the records myself, we don’t <i>all</i> have a backstage pass at the slums.” After letting this sink in for a beat, he added, “No offense, that, either, I guess.”<br><br>Franklin Gaussier’s lip curled downward just enough to reveal a light grimace. He cleared his throat.<br><br>“It’s a kind of catch-22, honestly, this question of how to divulge,” he said cryptically. “Of course, as you said, the customer’s patience is easily tried by a methodical account, which begins with the innocuous details and only gradually builds toward the key information. But how am I really any better off in giving away the bottom line first? After that, you see, the customer loses interest in the founding details. They’ve judged the value of the answer based solely on its most atomic phrasing.”<br><br>“You’re sounding a lot more like her than I think I requested,” observed the visitor.<br><br>“Well, I’m sorry, sir,” said Gaussier, “but I wouldn’t write off the ‘minutiae’ too quickly if I were you. Some of the finer details might be quite helpful to you. For instance, how about the name of the prostitute in question?”<br><br>The visitor hesitated before asking, “Is that covered in the two hundred?”<br><br>“Certainly.” When the visitor nodded and gestured for Gaussier to continue, he did so: “Her name is Trixie Cinnamon.”<br><br>An exasperated tone. “Her <i>hooker</i> name?”<br><br>“Isn’t that useful to you?”<br><br>“How?” the visitor demanded. “You expect me to call them and corroborate this information? You expect the pimp to say ‘Oh, Trixie, that’s right, Northcutt’s shacked up with her plenty of times’?”<br><br>Gaussier shrugged. “I wouldn’t say I <i>expect</i> it to work like that. To be honest, I’d be impressed with anyone who could get halfway to the topic of Northcutt over the phone with Trixie’s supervisor. All I was thinking was that if you have any doubts about my information so far, you could at least call the man just to confirm there <i>is</i> a Trixie Cinnamon under his employ.”<br><br>The visitor regarded him for a long moment, allowing the hum of the lamp to take prominence.<br><br>“Or,” he eventually said, “we could say I trust you’re not lying, because what else can you possibly trust an info broker about, and you could go on right here and now.”<br><br>“That’s what I like to hear!” Gaussier grinned. “But for what I want to share with you next, there’ll have to be an extra charge. This is the clincher, sir.”<br><br>The visitor snorted. “Of course. There’s always the clincher.”<br><br>“Well, let me give you a general idea. What say we skip the middle man? Forget the pimp, forget the phone number, and I’ll get you direct to Trixie herself.” In a hush: “You see, I also know her <i>real</i> name.”<br><br>“What is it?” the visitor asked at once.<br><br>“Just fifty more dollars. I’ve got fees of my own, you know.” The visitor stifled a betrayed look and pulled from his wallet two twenties and a ten, which were once again swallowed by Gaussier’s own. The informant responded by tearing a sheet of paper from his pocket notebook and writing down a name. He pushed the paper across the table to the visitor, jerking his head to indicate the arrival of a new customer uncomfortably close to their own table, a young man. Lester the barkeep mercifully caught the new customer’s attention with a shouted question from behind the counter while Gaussier’s client read the name aloud.<br><br>“I hope that’s a bit more satisfactory?” said Gaussier.<br><br>“Much more,” the visitor answered. “You don’t know her number, though, or…?”<br><br>“No, but I can’t imagine she won’t be in the phonebook under <i>that</i> name. You should be able to get ahold of her quite easily. Just ask your employer to extend her a nice substantial offer and she’ll be on your side in no time. What more decisive accusation could you need than the prostitute herself going public?”<br><br>The visitor groaned. “More expenses.”<br><br>“Yes, but Trixie’s the one to whom your employer’s money should <i>really</i> be going. She’s the one you need to win over. Myself, I’m just the facilitator.” Gaussier grinned and levelled a finger at the visitor. “And that’s why you did so well to choose me instead of Miss Mangjeol. You’ve prioritized your resources just right.”<br><br>“No, yeah, I get it.” The visitor shifted his weight to one side and cast a furtive glance around the room. “Put a nice little bribe together. See if we can’t get her to talk. Well, what else’ve I earned?”<br><br>“That’s all of the salient material, really,” said Gaussier. “Being already a stone’s throw from deposing our friend, I’m not sure what else you need to know. Although since you’re quite rightly intent upon getting your money’s worth, I can probably throw in an additional detail that’s persisted in my memory… Can I interest you, as part of the package already acquired, in the <i>number of times</i> the Governor’s taken up with Miss Cinnamon?” When the visitor nodded, Gaussier scribbled again, briefly, upon the loose sheet of paper. <br><br>On reading it the visitor’s bushy eyebrows jumped an inch up his forehead.<br><br>“Poor Abraham’s wife and children won’t take this very well,” the broker observed in a tone of faux mourning.<br><br>“He could’ve considered their best interests a long time ago,” was all the visitor had to say on that matter. He took the sheet of paper and stood up. He shook Gaussier’s hand. “I’d like to say you’ve been a huge help,” the visitor continued, “so I’ll be sure to say that once everything you’ve told me proves true.”<br><br>“Then I won’t have long to wait,” Franklin Gaussier smiled. “Really, though, there’s only one way you need to thank me, sir, and that’s by spreading the word. If anyone in your line of work is looking for answers, just… point them my way, would you?” A shade of weariness, whether genuine or calculated, overtook his smile. “To be honest with you, there’s no thing as too much publicity where I sit. When I said that most customers get taken in by myth and celebrity, I wish I could have been exaggerating.”<br><br>The visitor nodded.<br><br>“Understood. Well, until next time.”<br><br>“A pleasure,” said Gaussier, and the visitor, having made the sheet of paper disappear somewhere upon his person, left the table. His direct stride toward the door brushed him past the young bespectacled man’s table, and Gaussier fully expected the youth to blink up at Abraham Northcutt’s detractor, notice the empty seat at the table, and shuffle awkwardly over; but the fellow was tapping upon his phone with an expression of such taut concentration that he possibly would not have noticed the passage of Trixie Cinnamon herself in her scantest attire.<br><br>The next to fill the void opposite Gaussier was no client at all, in fact. He hadn’t noticed her entry, but then this wasn’t surprising: she had such a knack for appearing out of, and disappearing into, thin air as to shame the invisibility power of any “lurker” in the Archipelago. Ordinary humans had their talents, too.<br><br>“What’s the news, Debbie?” he asked as she slid down into the seat, sinking slightly between the cushions. “Is the Pellegrin deal moving forward?”<br><br>The woman shook her head. “It’s still not out the door yet. Latest word is that Kemper &amp; Farrow are thinking of backing down. They’re worried about the PR consequences if this comes to light.”<br><br>Gaussier sighed and wiped his brow. “Well, obviously. Fine time to be worrying about that, isn’t it? I just want everyone to get <i>moving</i> on this,” he said. “Still. Not my place to decide. What else?”<br><br>Debbie Schoen took out her own pocket notebook and consulted it. “Rumor of another Victor Saybolt spotting. Up north, this time. Also, someone’s taken out a bounty on Wakeling, I couldn’t pry out who. Plus she was trying to interest me in some more bits and pieces on the Butterfly, but I figured, not worth it. Those’re a dime a dozen...” Gaussier nodded in approval. “And my fees.” She tore a page out of the notebook and passed it to him.<br><br>“Well, this should tide you over for the moment,” he said, and passed a hundred-dollar bill her way. Schoen gaped.<br><br>“What’d you land?” she asked at once.<br><br>“Northcutt’s out,” he announced proudly. “<i>Finally</i> got a guy looking into it. I was starting to worry we’d go all the way to elections without any takers!”<br><br>As Schoen nestled the bill away, Gaussier leaned back. The nape of his neck met the cool wooden paneling beyond his seat. “No need to fret, really,” he continued, his intent leer relaxing into an idle grin. “Just me getting antsy. Should have trusted in the people. They wouldn’t let me down, not during muddy season. Not when Mother Theresa couldn’t run for office in Winstone without <i>someone</i> trying to smear her blessed name.”<br><br>“How much did you get for it?”<br><br>“Two fifty.”<br><br>Schoen frowned. “Only that?”<br><br>“Debbie,” said Gaussier at once; whenever she touched a nerve it was by going down this path. “You should’ve seen this guy. Was I going to stiff him? This wasn’t Junior hiked down from Watermunt Hill looking for his lost kitty-cat. This was an industry man.”<br><br>Even though the frown hadn’t entirely or even nearly lifted off her face, Schoen cocked her head to the side briefly in the shadow of an understanding shrug. He knew he did not have to explain further. There was, after all, only one industry he could mean – only one of relevance. “The industry” was name enough for every enterprise he had in mind: every trust, corporation and syndicate with its tendrils straining below, loosing down gray-haired men in long coats to run their course in this moonlit maze of gutters. To meet, to buy, to sell, to bribe, to plead, to threaten, perhaps to kill. The industry. Kemper &amp; Farrow. The Giarrettieras. Obsidian Hearts. Saeptum. Joyeuse. Quitters, Inc. You didn’t stiff an industry man. It was not simply a matter of safety – though that, too, of course, and always. When you met an industry man, you smiled and listened carefully and cut him half the deal you’d cut with a fellow from over the top, and why? <i>Repeat business</i>. Junior’s daddy sits at the table just once, to find out whether mommy has indeed been covertly boinking her aerobics instructor (a conclusion passed down to you by the bellhop from said instructor’s apartment complex), pays, leaves, and that is the last you ever see of the happy family. But you shake hands with Mr. Suit and you’ve got a connection. By next week you’ve met two of his friends. Talk in the industry is not cheap: it is a precious commodity. But what words pass are hindered by little of the shame that silences the folk overhead. Down here, paying a visit to the info broker is no different from stopping in at the bank… better, the gas station.<br><br>An industry fueled by secrets.<br><br>“It’s an investment.”<br><br>“Whatever you say, daddy-o,” was her sing-song reply, which managed to make her sound a good fifteen years younger at one stroke. Fifteen years whinier, at that. She made to stand from the table. “End of an era for Northcutt, huh?”<br><br>“Oh, I wouldn’t call it that,” said Gaussier with his best Yoon Mangjeol titter. “Better surely to look upon this as the beginning of a grand and exciting <i>new</i>–”<br><br>“Can it,” Schoen muttered with a grin, and slung her purse over her shoulder. “I’m going home. Rich’ll still be up.”<br><br>Gaussier, who knew full well that Rich would probably be happier to hear that she’d arrived at Felice Potabile to find the informant keeled over at his table soaking the placemats through from the hole in his cerebellum, said, “Give him my regards.”<br><br>Schoen, who knew it too, waved and walked away. Gaussier noticed the young man’s eyes flicker up from his wineglass for the fleetest moment to register her passing. Fair enough, even if the good dame was no Trixie Cinnamon. Then the youth’s cell phone lit up and buzzed, and pulled his attention back down into his own private world.<br><br>Franklin Gaussier rubbed his eyes and yawned, suddenly aware of the effect his own last Yuengling had brought about: his head, though still clear for the most part, was beginning to cry out for a proper pillow. The thrill of the meeting with the gray-haired man in the long coat, and that months-awaited revelation, had run its course. A curious but not entirely unfamiliar feeling akin to post-Christmas letdown had crept in. “What’s it matter?” he whispered almost inaudibly, more to test the sentiment than to commit to it. So Northcutt’s wife hadn’t been good enough (or easy enough) to scratch the itch. Why make a fuss? What real difference between the governor and Junior’s mommy? In the grand scheme of things, who actually gave a shit?<br><br>But of course it <i>did</i> matter, and there were many people out there who were prepared to give some <i>profound</i> shits regarding the subject, and Gaussier supposed the feeling would pass as soon as word started to filter back in about the consequences. Two days, maybe four. Let it take its time if it needed. Right now his bed was the only thing Gaussier was looking forward to.<br><br>The watch showed one twelve, and the words spoken by the figure whom he now looked up to see standing at the table poised like a butler, the young bespectacled man with dark curly hair, narrow features, and pale skin tinged a faint olive, echoed the informant’s own thoughts precisely:<br><br>“Closing time, isn’t it, Mr. Gaussier?”<br><br><br><br></div></div>

        <h2 class="poster">Beelzebibble</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message"><i>Two months before the present day<br>The Passione Rossa</i><br><br>The tip, a welcome but decidedly optimistic ten, made to disappear. The silverware swept onto the napkinned plate with a muffled jangle. The glass laid on top. And away. The surface (on which her least favorite menu item, barbecue wings, had been at play) spritzed briefly with cleaner, then wiped down with a handrag. And away. The sudden gasp of cool air, and the simmer of rain outside, cut short by the softer-than-ordinary clap of the door. And wave hello.<br><br>It was the Frenchman again, an unmistakable figure with his old-fashioned clothing and twitchy moustache. He paused after entering and returning her wave to stomp his weather-dulled spats dry upon the muddy rubber mat at the front door: the first customer yet to show this consideration all evening. Allison liked the Frenchman, who was polite and who did not stare overlong, nor outstay his welcome making loud comments at the athletes on the TV. That last went without saying, though: there was only one reason the Frenchman ever dropped by the Passione Rossa and it was not to root for the Caracoles. <br><br>In this, unlike in his manners, he was hardly unusual.<br><br>Yet luck was with the Frenchman tonight, as it had been yesterday evening, and frequently turned out to be, altogether – somehow Allison couldn’t remember if she’d ever seen him resigned to loiter at another table and wait for the hot seat to open up. He always seemed to know when to walk in, even though his entrances varied enough around the clock that she couldn’t believe he’d made a string of regular appointments. Just luck, that was all. Or else…<br><br><i>Lover’s intuition.</i><br><br>Well, if you wanted the diabetes explanation. <br><br>But Allison, God help her, had been subject to enough lecherous looks even before this waitressing gig (<i>especially</i> before, an unsolicited voice piped up in her thoughts, before being promptly silenced) to recognize when the attention was pointing some other woman’s way. The brisk nod and amiable “Hello!” with which the Frenchman greeted Allison, as he crossed into the darker, furthest-removed wing of the bar, were very different from the warmth that came into his face when he saw Ms. M waiting for him in the most distant booth, twirling that wineglass in her usual way.<br><br><i>Something</i>’d put the spring in his step, anyhow, because he hadn’t looked anywhere near this happy when he’d left the other evening. No lighthearted chat that had been, not for either of them. Not with Ms. M sitting there in tears over something she’d read in his notebook…<br><br><i>That’s enough.</i><br><br>Allison knew her business. The lines were drawn very clearly in the sand, and inquiries into the emotional life of Yoon Mangjeol fell way out on the other end of the beach, where the rocks lay coarse and jagged and there was a crab clinging to every shadow.<br><br><br><div align="center"><img style="max-width: 100%;" src="http://i322.photobucket.com/albums/nn433/asgardreid/allison.png"></div><br><br>Down went the Frenchman, into the hot seat. He was babbling in excitement – mostly inaudibly to Allison, of course, but she could still make out the accented tongue cutting each word loose from his mouth as with a handsaw. With the spray bottle and rag in hand again, Allison bustled at a table closer to the bar and silently counted off the seconds. Eight, nine, ten: there. Away at her table, Ms. M’s eyes flickered from the Frenchman just long enough to give to the waitress the expected fleeting glance.<br><br>Allison approached the table at a gentle stride, just slowly enough not to interrupt the Frenchman in mid-sentence:<br><br>“…but of course, madame, you must have seen it on the television…!”<br><br>“Anything for you, sir?”<br><br>She fully expected him to turn down the offer as usual, but to her surprise the Frenchman beamed up at her and announced, “A white wine, <i>mademoiselle</i>.”<br><br>She blinked. “One in particular, or—?”<br><br>“Whichever you like best!” he cried with no further comment. Taken aback, Allison looked at Ms. M inquiringly, but the older woman’s unfathomable smile was fixed on the Frenchman. As the waitress nodded and moved away from the table, she heard Ms. M reply, “Yes, Renard, I must say you caused quite a stir in the morning news…”<br><br>But that was the most Allison could make out while maintaining a polite pace. As she ducked beyond the counter and looked up and down the glimmering side wall, she wondered what Renard could have done to land a favorable mention on channel five. All right, this would probably suit him. It ought to be Gallic enough to pass muster, at least. She tugged the Chardonnay off the rack, fetched a wineglass from the shelf below, and filled it half full on the countertop, periodically glancing back at Ms. M all the while.<br><br><i>She</i> didn’t watch channel five that often, Allison. She preferred to keep up with things on a global scale, and channel four was all she needed for that. Local news… she could get along fine without the local news. The last couple of years, she’d barely tuned in to channel five once a week, and look at her now. Still alive, wasn’t she, in one of the shadiest cities in the Archipelago? Still kicking around perfectly fine without that daily fix of Power sightings and mob pressure… and scandals. When there was something going on in Winstone that was <i>really</i> worth knowing, she always found out about it here – and not just by eavesdropping on fragments of conversations with Ms. M, thank you very much. The rest of the Passione Rossa kept up a perfectly lively chatter in its own right. So who needed the news?<br><br><i>That’s right. Look at you now. Just where you want to be, aren’t you. Yes, Allie, thank Christ the times are past when you thought there might be an actual</i> future <i>sitting ahead of you. Brief times they were, half a year at best, but by God you’ve never spent a more miserable six months in your life. Aren’t you lucky to be back in the slums. Back where you belong.</i><br><br>Allison, whom such thoughts did hurt, yes, but who even now took a strange and vindictive pleasure in the very pain they brought, sighed and leaned forward on her elbows. There wouldn’t be time to check in with another table; if she missed her opportunity now, it could be ten minutes yet before the conversation cycled back to relatively safe ground. As she tapped the countertop with one hand, wineglass in the other, and awaited Ms. M’s next brief glance from the far wing, Allison found herself wondering once again where the money had gone.<br><br><br><br></div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Beelzebibble</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message"><i>Approximately the present day<br>A hotel in Europe</i><br><br>At first it could have easily been taken that the gradually-building rattles and thumps must have issued from the air conditioner, but when a blindly groping hand at last managed to dial the unit off, the noise failed to subside – in fact, it grew only more insistent. By now the blows had a discernibly wooden timbre, as though chairs and drawers were being violently upended and thrown to the floor somewhere nearby. The steady crescendo was capped at its peak by a feminine scream that broke off mid-breath. <br><br>Yoon Mangjeol sighed, pushed the covers off, and sat up. After donning her slippers by the bedside and ensuring the bathrobe was strictly fastened around her, she crossed in darkness to the door, unlatched and unlocked it, and pulled it open to reveal the oppressively lit hall. She gave a knock on the door next to hers, number 208.<br><br>Mercifully, he was still wearing a t-shirt and shorts. “Hey, Miz Mangjeol,” he said. “What – too loud?”<br><br>“That’s one way to put it,” said Yoon coolly, “while another would be that I’m faintly amazed the staff haven’t called the police on you yet, given substantial grounds to assume you were busily raping a woman in here.”<br><br>“Aw, haha, no, that’s the movie,” said Mayordomo, swinging the door open wider.<br><br>“You’re watching a film in which a woman gets raped,” Yoon inquired. She rubbed her eyes. The light out here was dreadful. She quite liked sunlight, but artificial light in any excess bothered her retinas terribly. Spending so many nights in the sparsely-lit Passione Rossa had carried out its effect.<br><br>“No no, nothin’ like that. Though I guess it’s probably s’pposed to <i>symbolize</i> rape. Or hey, I don’t know, could be he really does want to rape her, but we just can’t tell cause he <i>speaketh no tongue of man</i>.” Mayordomo retreated into his room, leaving the door open, and Yoon followed, both out of morbid curiosity and because, surprisingly enough, it seemed he shared her sensibilities in lighting: the overhead was off, leaving only the wall and desk lamps to provide illumination. Her eyes already relieved, Yoon noted that he’d also created substantially less of a mess than she’d anticipated – had, indeed, unpacked his things with a marked tidiness – before looking at the television screen.<br><br>The movie was a clear antique, entirely black-and-white, with a muffled operatic soundtrack. A figure in a grotesque rubber costume meant to emulate scales stood unsteadily in a canoe which rocked perilously on the surface of a muddy lake. Clutched in the monster’s webbed claws was the unconscious body of a woman in a slime-coated sun dress. With a gurgling screech of triumph, the monster pitched forward into the depths, taking the woman with him and leaving the capsized canoe to drift in the murky swamp water.<br><br>“Oh, the fishman,” Yoon observed.<br><br>“Hey!” Mayordomo protested at once. “Sorry I gotta put you right, Miz Mangjeol, but that right there is the Creature of the Black Lagoon. A <i>classic</i> thing that goes bump in the night. ‘Fishman’ got no grandeur.”<br><br>“Well! I stand corrected.”<br><br>Again the concerned expression. “Hey, listen, I wasn’t tryin’ to offend you. Sorry if I did. I just think this kinda stuff is worth calling what it is. Old-school counts for somethin’. Even old-school horror flicks!”<br><br>Yoon settled into a pinstriped armchair and watched the lake wipe itself away into a nighttime scene depicting an expedition camp in the jungle. Over the frantic debate between a pair of scientists onscreen, Mayordomo added, “Well, technic’lly they call him the Gill-Man, I guess. Quicker to say. But that ain’t got no grandeur, itself. Creature from the Black Lagoon, that’s his real name, far’s I’m concerned.” He dropped onto the edge of the bed, and the comforter gave a billowy ripple. “Me, I been watchin’ this stuff since before I knew what the hell a ‘lagoon’ even was… and hey, lemme tell you, that’s one of those words, you don’t gotta know what it means to <i>feel</i> somethin’ when you hear it. Powerful word. Scary, kinda. Got a lot of depth to it.” As he gazed at the screen, he idly murmured the word again, before eventually adding: “You musta thought that way about some words too, when you were young. I mean, not in English, naturally!”<br><br>The Creature lumbered into a dank grotto off what might have been the titular Black Lagoon. The putrid-looking water barely stirred in this low, vaulted cavern, and the monster’s every movement resounded harshly against the inert and silent chamber. Just as the monster was about to drop the kidnapped woman onto the rocky shore, its attention was torn away by the echoing cries of approaching rescuers. Yoon nodded slowly and murmured “Yes,” though at a volume which could hardly compete with the orchestral score. <br><br>But, not finding that she had any interest in elaborating, she added, “You’re familiar with this movie, did you say?”<br><br>“Oh I grew up on Universal flicks,” he said. “All the ol’ ghouls. Dracula, Frankenstein, the Mummy, the Wolf Man, the Invisible Man… Frankenstein’s <i>monster</i>, ‘scuse me.” He cleared his throat as the Creature retreated unsteadily into the shadows. “Yeah, Pop was an old horror buff and I guess he passed that gene on.”<br><br>“They must have been frightening stories for someone so young,” said Yoon, thinking of the <i>Gangshi</i> stories her older sister had told her on certain nights when they’d only been pretending to sleep.<br><br>“Frightening…?” Mayordomo replied in wonderment. “Hey. <i>Frightenin’?</i> Miz Mangjeol, I got no reason to lie to you. I’ll tell you, this shit never scared me. Not when I was a kid, not now. Never.” He pointed at the rubber-masked actor hunched onscreen with a two-fingered gesture Yoon recognized: earlier in the day he would have been pointing with his cigarette. “What’s frightenin’? This poor motherf&amp;[HASH]117;cker here in the fifty-pound suit? Ben Chapman? Havin’ to stand out in the back lot, get hosed down in between every few takes so he wouldn’t burn to a crisp in there? <i>Please.</i>” He shook his head. “You hear anyone under the age of seventy tell you Lugosi actually scares ‘em, hey, forget it. They’re lyin’, or else too sentimental, which is worse. On a <i>good</i> day this kinda movie’s just cheesy fun. On a bad day, it’s a f&amp;[HASH]117;ckin’ laugh riot.”<br><br>“I was under the impression you liked ‘this kinda movie’…”<br><br>“But I do. Hey, I love ‘em! Just, not cause they’re scary.” Mayordomo settled back on one elbow and scratched his stubbly chin with the other hand. “See, that’s the thing. Used to be, people thought Universal monster flicks really <i>were</i> scary as hell. Back when they were new and that’s where cinema was, those days. Now, hey, you got all these camera stunts and lighting tricks and all the See Gee Eye you need to put some <i>real</i> freaky shit onscreen, shit that makes the Wolf Man look like Lassie standin’ on her hind legs.<br><br>“And, you know, hey, that’s just how it is, technology marches on, but it hits horror movies worse than most kinds. Your Casablanca, your Citizen Kane, those kinda flicks still do what they do just about as well as they ever did. People talkin’ to each other, you can’t film that any better’n it’s already been filmed. But horror movies, those get scarier and scarier every generation and we’re <i>still</i> holdin’ onto the classics. Hey, you ask me, that proves something. Shows they got something goin’ for them more’n just how frightening they are.”<br><br>Abruptly Mayordomo’s monologue ended, and without the usual barrier of his sunglasses, Yoon could almost read a faint degree of embarrassment in his face. She was, herself, shocked: while her escort was undeniably chatty, this was by far the longest she’d ever heard him hold forth on a particular subject, instead of making his usual ten different attempts at conversation in a minute. She sat there for some short time, not quite knowing what to say.<br><br>“Well, Mr. Mayordomo, you’ve thrown me for a loop,” she managed by and by.<br><br>He began at once: “Sorry if I rambled—”<br><br>“No, no, I found that very insightful!” Yoon smiled at the young man, who nodded, apparently comforted. “All I mean to say is that… as far as cultural phenomena go, the field of old horror pictures isn’t one upon which I’d have expected you to hold such ardent views.”<br><br>“Figured I’d be into other kindsa movies, huh? Big ol’ summer blockbusters, probably? Lotta shootin’ and car chases? People jumpin’ outta buildings <i>on fire</i>?” His inflection and subsequent sly grin left it unclear whether those on fire were meant to be the buildings, the people, or both. “Lot of explosions?”<br><br>Yoon drew in her breath and regarded him for an uncomfortable moment.<br><br>“I… well, yes, I suppose that would have been my guess.”<br><br>But Mayordomo threw back his head and laughed. “Miz Mangjeol, you don’t think I see enough of that shit on a daily basis? Hey, whole reason I watch movies is to get away from that shit!”<br><br>Yoon folded her arms and leaned back in her chair. “There’s sense in that,” she admitted.<br><br>“It’s more’n sensible, it’s necessary. I tell you, you got to know this just as well as I do. You don’t give <i>all</i> yourself up to the industry.” Although Mayordomo had returned to watching the screen, the quiet, deliberate tone his words had taken suggested that his attention was not really fixated on the strapping hero who at that very moment was rushing to the fallen heroine’s side. “You can’t do that. Hey, you do, you’re gonna go crazy… You got to keep a part of yourself you can call your own. Somethin’ well away from all the shit you gotta put up with to get by. Don’t set up some kinda boundary, don’t tell them what’s theirs and what’s yours… and the industry’s gonna chew you up and spit you right back out.” He gave up any pretense of watching the Creature’s last stand. “And Miz Mangjeol, you been at this a lot longer’n I have and <i>you</i> don’t look like no wad of used-up gum on the pavement, so I don’t guess this is comin’ in as any big news to you.”<br><br>She smiled without much of a reason. “I’m afraid the industry’s been working on me for some decades now, Mr. Mayordomo,” she said. “If I haven’t been gnashed into a pulp by this point, one suspects that only means I’m more the gobstopper type than chewing gum…”<br><br>“Then you deny what I’m sayin’? Sold your soul to the industry altogether, huh? Nothin’ about you they ain’t ground up in the gears?”<br><br>“Oh I never said that,” replied Yoon, feeling at least that her smile was now taking on some strength.<br><br>As he took this in, Mayordomo scratched his chin again with a lone, spindly thumb. Then he asked: “So what’s <i>your</i> favorite kinda movie, then?”<br><br>“Guess,” she said.<br><br>“Well! If I was boring and didn’t know better, I figure… I’d say you was probably into historical dramas and maybe operas. And <i>maybe</i> some old mystery films, long as they had some credibility to ’em, cause I bet you’d like putting the puzzle pieces together. And, hey, Korean films, too, of course.”<br><br>Rather than remind him that a set of films did not in fact constitute a single genre simply by hailing from a common nation (she had no need to hear him lapse into another bout of apologies and anyway his intentions were good), Yoon merely replied: “All fine guesses, and mostly true. But, as you say, quite boring!”<br><br>Mayordomo regarded her for a few beats with his jaw slightly askew, as though working a scrap of popcorn loose from between two side teeth. Then he ventured: “Romance.”<br><br>A younger Yoon, raised in the Archipelago rather than further northwest, would have rolled her eyes.<br><br>“How stereotypically feminine.”<br><br>“Now you got to either deny it or not, Miz Mangjeol. I know you don’t like givin’ straight answers but c’mon this is serious, here.”<br><br>Yoon gathered the folds of the bathrobe around her and straightened up with mock decorum. “I will not deny it,” she stated grandly, though she tempered Mayordomo’s look of triumph by adding: “but that’s a very broad answer and I think you can narrow it down better.”<br><br>“Not romantic comedies,” said Mayordomo at once.<br><br>“God save me, no.”<br><br>“Well good. <i>Shit</i>,” he breathed, in the tone of one who had just narrowly avoided a car crash. He slumped a little further upon the hotel bed.<br><br>“No, actually it’s a bit more in the other direction,” she said lightly, with an innocent glance at the television and a light yawn.<br><br>The reply was, of course, delayed by incredulity.<br><br>“Aw Christ,” Mayordomo got out. “The <i>weepy</i> – You like the weepy stuff! All stolen kisses and tortured gazes. F&amp;[HASH]117;ckin’ violins screeching out rhapsodies of woe. The kinda movie where everyone you’re rootin’ for winds up dead or heartbroken and lucky if they ain’t <i>both</i>.”<br><br>“Yes, I find them truer to life in that regard,” replied Yoon, before adding with a touch of defensiveness she could recognize herself, “more faithful than the Creature from the Black Lagoon, at any rate…”<br><br>“Hey, can’t argue.” Mayordomo half-shrugged and took the cue to resume watching the movie, but it wasn’t long before he added: “So you must be heartbroken, then, huh, Miz Mangjeol?” <br><br>And now Yoon froze, lips parted as if on the edge of speech, but turning up nothing whatsoever to say. A cold sensation was spreading from within her chest. The face of Hwan had swum forth and taken clearer shape in her mind than at any time in the last few month – years, even, perhaps. Each bristle in his beard, it seemed, was there for the counting; each wrinkle adding its own distinctive streak upon his long, proud face. The medals on his breast were no generic yellow inlays adorning a featureless jacket, but shone gold under the exhausting radiance of the sun. She could have reached out and touched them…<br><br><br><div align="center"><img src="http://i322.photobucket.com/albums/nn433/asgardreid/hwan.png" style="max-width: 100%;"></div><br><br>If she could honestly say this was the last time she had ever seen him, Yoon would have been only too happy to. But it wasn’t. She <i>knew</i> it wasn’t, and was cursed to know. Her true last memory of Hwan had worn down to an atom of a scene, an isolated fragment, not even bristles or medals but a <i>movement</i>, a slow turning-away… Yet she understood why that image had been ruined and this one preserved perfectly. She’d had no idea that would be the last time she would ever see him, whereas on this occasion, she’d dreaded it. She had committed him to herself now, when later she would fail to. And so Yoon’s reward was to remember him here, on the airstrip, about to depart for the death they both knew to expect, rather than when he’d departed for the death that she, at least, had failed to foresee.<br><br>“What exactly do you mean by that?”<br><br>Mayordomo blinked. “Well, uh… you said it’s true to life that everyone winds up dead or heartbroken, so I figured–”<br><br>“And do I give you the impression that I’ve ‘wound up’ anything at all, Mr. Mayordomo?” she asked, her tone degenerating into a harsh hiss. “That my story has ended? I have nothing left to accomplish? Nothing more to become?”<br><br>Immediately something splintered in the young man’s face.<br><br>“I – hey – no–”<br><br>“Then why should it be that I’m heartbroken?” <br><br>Yoon fixed him with a satisfied smile. Once again anticipating that he was about to plunge into a torrent of apologies, she intervened: better to leave the subject well enough alone. The feeling of coldness hadn’t yet nearly receded. “But never mind. I’d wanted to say something else. There’s a bit of a flaw in your philosophy that I can see, I’m afraid.”<br><br>With a frown: “You mean… about movies, or…?”<br><br>“No no, about the industry. This idea of yours that everyone who’s connected needs to keep a part of themselves separate from their work, in order to survive. That’s quite endearing, but I have a counter-example.”<br><br>“Oh?” Mayordomo sat up from his position on the bed and leaned forward, elbows on knees. “And who’s that, Miz Mangjeol?”<br><br>“Your employer.”<br><br>He raised his hands at once, as though in defense. “Hey, now,” he said, “that ain’t mine to say. You’ve known him a lot longer’n I have!”<br><br>“That’s so,” she replied. “I’ve known him since he was barely tall enough to rest his chin on the table. And I can tell you, from <i>my</i> experience, Mr. Mayordomo… I’ve never picked up the slightest hint that he has any private life worth speaking of. As near as I can divine, your employer may not have a soul at all, never mind an entire inner world of clandestine joys and desires! What is there to portion off from his work? He <i>is</i> his work, and nothing else.” Yoon crossed her legs and relaxed against her chair. “However, that’s simply the impression I’ve gathered… and as you know perfectly well, the duration of our acquaintance speaks not at all to its familiarity. Which is to say that he and I are no allies; only—” Even the delicate wording she next managed nonetheless took effort. This was hardly any gentler a subject. “Only participants in a kind of symbiotic relationship.” She gestured to Mayordomo. “Since you, on the other hand, enjoy the privilege of being counted as a proper associate of his, I naturally assumed you might be able to share some insights into his nature which, from my more remote position, remain invisible to me. Though I take it from your less-than-eager expression that I’m wrong?”<br><br>Another long silence befell the hotel room, during which time Mayordomo sat with furrowed brow, evidently wary of speaking too soon before he’d fully worked over what she’d told him. He opened his mouth, withdrew, and finally spoke.<br><br>“I don’t… I don’t think it’s that there’s nothin’ to him we don’t see. Yeah, Miz Mangjeol, I <i>do</i> think he’s got a soul!” he insisted, in spite of her skeptical look. “Fact, I know he does. ’S just…” <br><br>“Go on,” said Yoon.<br><br>Mayordomo sighed. “Well, it’s like this, the way I see it. You and him, you’re just about equally good at keepin’ secrets. I feel like you both <i>don’t</i> say a whole hell of a lot more’n you do say. Hey, not like me, I can’t keep a secret worth a damn. I was born a talker and I’m gonna die a talker, too.” He chuckled, though not in his usual way, suddenly sounding to Yoon like a much older man. <br><br>“But even then, you go about it all different. See, Miz Mangjeol, <i>you</i> do a lot of dancin’ around the things you don’t want to talk about. You play all these little games and kinda twist the conversation around ‘til it’s back where you’re comfortable. And hey, if you don’t mind my saying so – I think you kinda enjoy it! Droppin’ hints about what’s running through your mind, nothin’ specific, just enough to show there’s a whole other process goin’ on there below the surface. Now am I dead wrong or is that pretty much the gist?”<br><br>Yoon nodded in silent acceptance of this judgment. Even though she doubted he’d say the same if he understood how directly and inelegantly she’d steered away from the subject of Hwan, his interpretation was indeed pretty much the gist.<br><br>Encouraged, he went on. “See, though, our mutual pal ain’t so eloquent about it as you are. Not by half. If he don’t want to talk about something, he just shuts the f&amp;[HASH]117;ck up, that’s all. You’re over there dancin’ around your secrets, and <i>he</i> ain’t even movin’ an inch. So those things he keeps apart from the industry, they’re just little specks way out on the horizon and they never get <i>no</i> closer.” He shook his head. “Doesn’t mean they’re not out there, though. Hey, all it means is they’re probably somethin’ a little more precious than his tastes in movies. Not to belittle your secrets or mine, obviously!” he added hastily.<br><br>But the woman took not even potential offense: it was her turn to carefully digest his words. She twisted a fold of fabric around her finger in what, she realized, was an imitation of the motion of her finger around the rim of her personal wineglass at the Passione Rossa. “This is all quite impressively idealistic of you,” she ventured, “perhaps too much so…”<br><br>Mayordomo chuckled again, and this was much more in line with his usual outbursts: boyish and hearty. “Hey, what can I say? I’m an awful nice guy, Miz Mangjeol. Too nice for my line of work, I’d tell you on six days out of seven…”<br><br>Unfortunately Yoon Mangjeol did not laugh along with him. As a matter of fact, she was not even entirely sure she agreed. Amiable though Roufus Mayordomo might be, she could never manage to altogether forget the image of the coin-sized explosives even now lining the walls and corners of her modest home in Winstone, each one only awaiting the signal from a cell phone to detonate. As stringently as she’d kept up a tally of the tiny charges while they’d been installed, Yoon knew full well that she would agonize for years to come after returning to the Archipelago, sure that one or more of them must have been left on the property under the orders of his employer. In the attic, perhaps? Or in the cellar? Or…?<br><br>The Creature from the Black Lagoon staggered out of its cave to the shore, followed by a band of rifle-carrying fishermen. In a final volley of bullets the monster was laid low. Without turning back to face its attackers, the Creature pitched forward into the water and stiffly sank to the lagoon’s floor. While the credits rolled and the young man stretched out his arms and declared it was well past his bedtime, Yoon found herself thinking again of the word Mayordomo had called to her mind earlier, a word she’d tacitly grasped and feared before she could understand its meaning. And now at least she could put a name to the common element among all the thoughts swirling and coalescing in her mind: thoughts of her home, strung as if with Christmas lights and ready to explode if she made one move that Mayordomo’s employer would consider a misstep, and thoughts of the Raiixian assignment and the expectations of Ms. van Meegeren, and thoughts of Hwan, and of the man in the tattered rubber suit slowly plummeting to the bed of the Black Lagoon; and that name was <i>jun jaeng</i>.<br><br><br><br></div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Beelzebibble</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Then it happened: Yoon Mangjeol’s face turned a few faint degrees away from the Frenchman sitting ahead of her; she dropped her eyes, which then almost indiscernibly flickered up toward Allison at the counter before she reversed the gesture precisely and ended up facing Renard head-on again. And approach.<br><br>The wineglass clinked toward the table on a silver tray. Allison deposited the drink at the Frenchman’s hand, receiving a hushed “<i>Merci</i>” in return under the sound of Ms. M’s words:<br><br>“Naturally, I was quite impressed that you managed to track her down…”<br><br>“Sure thing,” Allison muttered to the Frenchman before sweeping her dark hair over her shoulder and beating another modest retreat. Who was the woman Renard had managed to track down, she wondered, and why? Ms. M couldn’t possibly have a <i>competitor for his affections</i>, could she? The thought made Allison stifle a grin, though it didn’t last long. All too soon she’d begun to come up with other reasons why an apparently single man would want to track down a woman.<br><br>“’Nother Bud, sweetheart?” requested a leery pockmarked face at another table, as if on cue. Allison nodded and scooped up his mug in passing without a smile; she had no interest in gracing him and his two companions with any display of good will. A hearty tip wasn’t worth it from men like that.<br><br>Which neatly nestled the subject of money back into the forefront of her thoughts.<br><br><i>It hadn’t been enough.</i><br><br>Yes, there was always that excuse: it hadn’t been enough to pull herself up farther than one rung on the ladder. Not enough to leave this city behind, not enough to find a new home somewhere far away. Not enough to make another life. Not enough to reinvent herself. <i>Identity is a precious and costly resource, Allie. You learned that, didn’t you? It might even be the only thing in life that costs you to shed just as much as it costs you to gain. Doesn’t that sound right?</i><br><br>A windfall. Her big break. A gift from the… well, no, not the <i>gods</i>, anything but, that much was clear – but some people in very high places. More money than she’d make in two years doing <i>any</i> job, tucked into her pocket in one instant,<br><br><i>(and you blew it.)</i><br><br>and all it’d accomplished in the end was half the bargain. All those funds had been poured into nothing more than erasing her old identity. As to shaping the new one… well, if Allison had been better-equipped for that, obviously she wouldn’t be working here now, finding this new and admittedly less objectionable but no more praiseworthy way to waste a perfectly good college degree.<br><br>The glass mug’s rattle against the metal surface of the keg. The barely-audible wheeze of the tap as she pulled it to measure out the bitter ale. The mushroom cap of foam just managing to bulge from above the mug’s rim. The fresh coaster rolling lightly off the rack into her hand. And deposit. <br><br>“Thanks, babe.”<br><br>Then she almost laughed aloud in a very delayed reaction to her own choice of words. “Objectionable” – that was just such a precious way to put it. Objectionable was when you got to the hotel and found out the room had no running water. Didn’t really go all that far toward describing her last gig. And <i>that</i> overboiled pulp-fiction word right there, “gig”, just about sent her into hysterics.<br><br>The problem here, Allison considered as she leaned against the counter with a wrist over her mouth, was that there was just no angle to broach the subject that didn’t taste wrong in one f&amp;[HASH]117;cking hilarious way or another.<br><br>An urgent voice protruding over the dense plane of chatter caught her attention. It was the Frenchman’s. Leaning forward at the table and gesticulating broadly, he gave the impression that he was quite excited – accusatory, at that. Allison was sure she could discern a pair of words Renard sounded out with particular gusto, even though the name “Gloomy Jo-Ann” didn’t mean anything to her. She looked at Ms. M inquiringly, but the Korean woman made no eye contact. Of course, the context for the name wouldn’t be something she’d want Allison to hear. She was nodding along with the Frenchman’s words; in another moment she laughed lightly and made some reply that didn’t much seem to settle him down.<br><br>Before a squinting Allison could make out any more of their conversation, she was distracted by the arrival of a pair of rough-looking older Asian men in dark suits, possibly Japanese, who moved immediately to an open booth without stomping their shoes clean on the rubber mat. Thinking of the <i>yakuza</i> and the murmurs she’d overheard that they were seeding an increasing presence in Winstone, Allison tensed. She looked back up the counter, where she could tell Howie was thinking the same thing: the bald, muscular bartender stood tensely at the exact spot where a Remington rifle hung concealed beneath the countertop. From the Asian men, however, came no urgent sign that they were here with mischief in mind. Actually, they didn’t even seem to have come to visit Ms. M, unless they were deliberately concealing their intentions: their eyes never moved in her direction. Still Allison hesitated, but to her relief, Howie brushed past her with a tight “I’ll get ‘em,” leaving her to replace him behind the counter.<br><br>All part of the arrangement between them – oh yes, Ms. M wasn’t the only one who’d made an arrangement with Howard! And Allison considered her own to be no less worthy. After all, even though Ms. M did bring in nearly half the Passione Rossa’s customers singlehandedly, Allison was the one who actually had to clean up after them. Her terms with Howie were simple and clear: If all you had to do to envision the customer on a wanted poster was blink, Howie took care of him. She wasn’t going to put herself within reach.<br><br>That was their arrangement. Except of course for the one small additional clause that if Sakharov so much as showed his face inside the bar, the Remington would be on him the moment he strolled in. Something which <i>he</i> understood too, mind. One could call it a point of overlap between the arrangement she’d made with Howie and the arrangement she’d made with Sakharov.<br><br><i>Identity is a costly thing…<br><br>All that money.<br><br>It costs you to gain…<br><br>A windfall.<br><br>It costs you to shed…<br><br>Your big break.</i><br><br>How long, though, could she have expected to hold onto money that had been so easy, so stupidly easy, to earn?<br><br><i>Not easy. Not at all. Hard. Painful. Frightening. Mortifying.</i> But it was only in retrospect that she could see things so. Only after taking into account all the consequences of that singular decision close to two years ago. Allison knew full well that the decision itself, in the moment of choosing, had been effortless. God, she’d been champing at the <i>bit</i> to take the offer and the money. And all she’d had to do was step forward and speak.<br><br>The Frenchman stood and addressed Ms. M in a jubilant tone. Somehow, she must have eased his concerns about this “Gloomy Jo-Ann” character. He made an extravagant bow, then turned and marched to the door, pausing only to bid Allison a cheery “And a lovely evening to you, <i>mademoiselle</i>!”<br><br>“Good night,” she said.<br><br>In departing, the Frenchman crossed paths with Howie, who slapped his notepad down onto the counter with a sigh. “Gonna fix ‘em up,” he said, nodding toward the two Japanese men. “You go…” But there was no need for him to finish the sentence: Allison was already approaching the far table where Ms. M sat twirling a wineglass with her finger in her customary way. The waitress looked to the Frenchman’s side of the table, but it was bare except for his payment, and only after another moment did Allison realize that Ms. M was spinning Renard’s empty glass rather than her own. She handed it up to Allison with a smile.<br><br>“You know what he did, don’t you,” asked Ms. M.<br><br>Allison blinked. “No,” she said, not sure whether to expect an act of heroism or villainy.<br><br>“Well that’s strange, isn’t it, considering it was all over the news,” Ms. M remarked, in a familiar and unwelcome tone of condescension. Allison had to stifle a wince. “You really didn’t hear anything? Have we fallen behind on events? Mr. Rouletabille has recovered a painting that had been stolen from the Gallery of Art. It only took him a day, at that! Now do you call this clever?”<br><br>“Who stole it?”<br><br>“Yet to be apprehended,” came the prompt and perky reply, “which is all you will hear from <i>me</i>. Off you go, then!”<br><br>Sounded like she was in a good mood, Allison thought as she took the wineglass back to the counter, and the young woman found herself wondering if the Ms. M-Renard situation could carry more weight than she’d imagined. But then, of course, it might just be that the Frenchman had paid off some of what Allison gathered to be a considerable debt to Ms. M… Or even that he’d supplied the informant with some new piece of knowledge she’d been expecting for a while… Now the wince was free on Allison’s lips as she rinsed the wineglass and brought it back into the kitchen to dry on the rack. God, the way Ms. M spoke to her, as if she was in middle school – <br><br>But obviously it was Allison’s fault, really. If she ever watched channel five or picked up a newspaper, she’d have already known what Renard Rouletabille had accomplished, and she wouldn’t have needed it explained to her in that irritatingly pleasant tone. Allison leaned against the coldly-lit kitchen’s spacious sink and considered, for nowhere near the first time, that it might be time to let go of all her silly old hangups about the local news and start keeping up with things properly again.<br><br>Surely the reporters couldn’t hurt her anymore.<br><br>Surely, almost two years after the fact, there was nothing left to say about that. No more jokes, even.<br><br>And there was further appeal to the idea beyond just keeping up with Ms. M and not being constantly made to look like a fool… No, that was a stupid thought, she had to keep her prospects more realistic than that. Though, why not? Allison rubbed her temples and considered. She was in a decent position here, with a kind of upward mobility that didn’t necessarily make itself known at first. Not the waitressing job itself, but the environment: this land of rumors and whispers. She was a smart woman, was Allison, smarter than the world took her for. Give her a year to build, to gather, and who knew?<br><br>How many other up-and-comers could claim to have been given contained but <i>firsthand</i> access to most every conversation Yoon Mangjeol had?<br><br>She listened – Allison. She kept her ear to the ground. And she didn’t forget faces easily. Get back in the habit of following the local news and she’d hold a pretty favorable hand. And then, she thought, it might just be time to start carving out her own niche in the industry. An alternative to Ms. M and her exorbitant prices. Why not? A while yet would pass before the idea could really take off, and there was plenty of information to scoop up here and there in the meantime. For the collection.<br><br>Ms. M thought her an idiot but not for long.<br><br>Then the feeling of gleefully fierce resolve faded and Allison came back to where she was, in this unlovely kitchen of a bar where the light had almost no strength. Was this really where she wanted to stay for another year or more? When would she be able to leave this dismal city behind? But where else could she go? Of course there must be demand for informants elsewhere in the Archipelago, but leave the Passione Rossa and she was abandoning her one “in”, the hook that would win attention and business: her position of privilege with Ms. M. Even so, the idea of staying on here indefinitely, spinning herself into a web she’d never escape…<br><br><i>Forget it. Let it go. You need to get out of here, Allie. There’s money for you somewhere else. There’s another life out there.

Allison shook her head, clearing her thoughts.<br><br>“Right here,” she affirmed, and crossed the doorway again into the shadows, so that the only motion remaining in the harshly monochrome kitchen was a barely perceptible dripping, as the solitary wineglass on the rack formed an ever-slowly-widening dark blemish upon the cloth below.<br><br><br><br></div></div>
    
        <h2 class="poster">Beelzebibble</h2>
        <div class="content"><div class="message">Gaussier blinked up at the young fellow, now the only customer left in Felice Potabile, and mustered enough energy for an ingratiating smile and a satisfyingly-composed welcome. “It’s certainly getting there, my friend, though I’d be the last to turn a potential client away on no more substantial grounds than the hour of the clock. If you’ve been waiting there so long to have a chat, I’ve got no intention of telling you to come back tomorrow…!”<br><br>The bespectacled man nodded, but said nothing, leaving Gaussier time to notice and privately commend the crispness of his attire. Too few young people nowadays had any sense of decorum. On the other hand, as far as Franklin Gaussier knew, dressing up was supposed to make you feel confident, not stand there awkwardly with nothing to say. Guessing the youth must be nervous, the informant pressed on. “That is, assuming you do have a question for me?”<br><br>“Yes,” was the mumbled response.<br><br>“Well then, by all means, have a seat and ask away!” Gaussier implored. <i>And try to express your question in more than two words, will you, kid?</i> he added in thought. At this rate he was going to fall asleep at the wheel on the way home and go off the road.<br><br>The young man heeded the informant’s silent request, and half of his spoken request, but not the other half: he did ask a question then, quietly and carefully, and it <i>was</i> expressed in more than two words, but he did not avail himself of the table’s unoccupied cushion.<br><br>“Mr. Gaussier, would you please stand up now, and exit the building as though nothing is wrong?”<br><br>A telling click brought the informant’s attention down to the young man’s right hand, which was now holding a pitch-black pistol aimed from the hip at Gaussier’s chest. <br><br>He froze.<br><br>Everything, in fact, seemed to come to a halt. The second hand on his watch might not even have been pushing any further around the face. Gaussier stared at the pistol with wide eyes and slightly parted lips, his lungs working tensely to bring in the bare minimum of air necessary to breathe. For although he would have rather given the opposite impression to those he met in his nightly dealings, Franklin Gaussier had never been held at gunpoint before.<br><br>In another moment, however, cooler heads prevailed, and Gaussier relaxed slightly in his seat, even as he felt his skin growing clammy against the fabric. A smile fought for recognition on his face.<br><br>“Lester…”<br><br>He looked to the counter, sure that the bartender would remember what they’d discussed, but he looked in vain: the bar was deserted. Only the back door, left slightly ajar, gave any hint that Gaussier and the young man were not alone in Felice Potabile.<br><br>The young man cleared his throat.<br><br>“We’re aware that you’ve arranged to imitate the same lines of defense employed by Miss Mangjeol at the Passione Rossa,” he said, still in that steady, precise tone, “the least of your faults of mimicry. We’ve already explained the matter to Lester Hanratty, who should currently be sitting in the back room along with the revolver from beneath the countertop. He understands that several of my associates are keeping guard over his wife and children at their home as we speak. Do you know the names of his children, Mr. Gaussier?”<br><br>“I – ah—” began Gaussier, who had never asked.<br><br>“He has two sons, Michael and Adam, and a daughter named Molly. He loves them very much. Very much more, I’m afraid, than he values his professional relationship with you. Do you understand my meaning, Mr. Gaussier?”<br><br>Gaussier swallowed and nodded faintly.<br><br>“Then there should be no point waiting for him to charge in through that door and shoot me down in a dramatic act of rescue. Isn’t that so?”<br><br>Stillness.<br><br>In one gesture the young man lowered his head and raised his gun. The first hint of a genuine glower had formed on his previously stony face. And now the eyes that gazed down at the informant from beyond the wire-rimmed glasses seemed not at all so young, nor so ill at ease. “Mr. Gaussier.”<br><br>His mouth dry, Gaussier managed: “That’s right.”<br><br>The young man stepped smartly back and to the side, just barely leaning against the table of the next booth over, opening up the path for the informant to make his way to the exit. “Please stand, then.”<br><br>Gaussier lingered in the seat for the longest he dared, unable to resist another glance at the back door and the tantalizing flourescent light just visible beyond. Was he only imagining the rustling he heard from the kitchen, and the metallic scrape of a chair sliding away? <br><br>But the young man was not proven wrong: no Lester Hanratty burst in from the kitchen to save Gaussier’s hide; and it was only another moment before the informant stirred, faltered, and finally rose to stand unsteadily alongside the man with the pistol, who gestured toward the counter with his free hand. “I think tradition dictates I should offer you a drink at this point…”<br><br>The implacable finality of his words settled slowly into Gaussier and drained the color from his face. Heart rattling, he choked on a sudden image of his own body sprawled against the counter, dripping blood into the shakers beneath his crushed head. Surely the man wouldn’t—<br><br>“But it’s a tradition I choose not to hold with,” the assailant continued sharply. “Mr. Gaussier, drink and drunkards sicken me. The smell of alcohol already festers in every corner of my life and I see no reason to add your poison of choice to the stench. What’s more, I’d like you to leave this establishment in as sober a frame of mind as possible. Do you see? Good. Then please exit through the front door, touching nothing on your way.”<br><br>At this point, Gaussier was himself surprised to feel his legs going into motion immediately. Though he walked slow and wavering, he did not hesitate. He felt sickly as though his body had taken complete control, willing, perhaps even <i>eager</i> to go to the ugly death in the parking lot toward which it now steered his feebly-protesting brain… But there was something strange, he realized as he approached the front door with the gait of an old man. He’d heard no footsteps following along behind. He craned back his head to see the bespectacled man still standing there at Gaussier’s table, the gun once again held low, at the hip. He watched without moving or betraying the least expression.<br><br>Still looking back at the assailant, almost as if asking permission, Gaussier reached out and took hold of the cool metal doorknob. The assailant was as motionless as ever. And now a bright and clear thought was unveiled with a flourish in Gaussier’s mind: was he going to be given a head start? Naturally, the young man would want him as sober as possible at the outset: there’d be no chase if Gaussier tripped over the front step and fell right into a puddle of his own vomit. The thought stirred him: obviously he couldn’t outrun the young man, even pretending it was a knife instead of a gun in his hand – but he <i>could</i> hide from him… Then the sheet came off an even more marvelous thought as Gaussier twisted the knob and pushed the door open into the black air: What if the young man wasn’t here to kill him at all? What if all this had been nothing more than a threat? If someone in the industry didn’t want Franklin Gaussier showing his face around Winstone anymore, well, that was a request old Frank was only too happy to oblige. He’d pack the essentials tomorrow morning and skip town by the—<br><br>“Right here, motherfucker.”<br><br>An enormous, hulking form loomed out of the darkness.<br><br>The man’s broad nose and cleft chin took shape under the neon gleam of the bar’s façade, framing an expression of brute malice. His weapon was a far cry from the easily-concealed pistol belonging to the wirier man back inside; it looked more like a hand cannon. “No, keep movin’, pal,” he ordered, jerking a thumb over his shoulder. “Parade’s this way.”<br><br>The swell of mindless hope within Gaussier broke like a wave against the rocks. Stiffly he looked beyond the large figure to the dark minivan indicated by his gesture, parked well out of the light in a remote corner of the lot. A third silhouette was faintly visible inside, sitting restlessly at the farthest-back row of cushions. Which inspired a sudden mad urge to protest aloud: surely, Gaussier thought, it couldn’t take <i>three</i> goons to deal with an out-of-shape thinking man like himself…?<br><br>“I said <i>this way</i>,” the large man snapped, and with a sudden motion his arm closed what might have seemed to be an impossible gap between them and Gaussier’s own upper arm was instantly clenched within a steely vise grip. At once his final reserves of dignity broke down, and as the large man hauled him off the front step and away from Felice Potabile, Gaussier lapsed into frantic denial: “<i>Oh God oh Christ no please wait…</i>”<br><br>“Save it.” The large man pulled Gaussier around and slammed him against the back hatch of the van, giving an electric jolt all through the informant’s bones. His impact against the vehicle sent the passenger inside into a flurry of muffled shouts, and Gaussier’s first inane thought, driven by a twisted crime-flick logic, was that the third thug must be The Loony One, a bugeyed grotesque waiting in the far back seat with a matchbook and a rusty pair of pliers – Now the large man had dropped his wide-barrelled gun loosely into a jacket pocket and was pulling something else, a roll of duct tape, out of the other.<br><br><i>This is it, you idiot!</i><br><br>But what could Gaussier do? Flee, or throw a punch, or even try to snatch the weapon away from the man? In any case he would be a bloody pulp within seconds. The large man wasn’t keeping his gun on Gaussier, he realized as his hands and fingers were roughly sealed together into a silver cocoon, because there was no need to: as long as they were within four feet of each other, the large man had uncontestable control.<br><br>“Took you fuckin’ long enough,” said the large man, which seemed a fundamentally unfair thing to tell someone in this scenario until Gaussier realized he wasn’t speaking to him at all, but to the young bespectacled man, who had only now left Felice Potabile and strode toward the minivan.<br><br>This one stood back with his thinner pistol raised to the level of Gaussier’s head. “I was holding to the plan.”<br><br>“Oh right, like you needed to!” The large man wound the roll of tape around Gaussier’s wrists again, nearly breaking them in the process. “The place was fuckin’ dead, wasn’t it? We coulda been wavin’ Uzis around in there. You coulda gone with him.”<br><br>The bored reply: “First I thought it would be worth checking on the bartender to assure his silence on the matter.”<br><br>The large man grunted, then chuckled heavily in understanding, showing thick teeth. Gaussier balked, reminded of a grizzly bear’s canines. <br><br>“By <i>talking</i> to him, Cesare.”<br><br>This name caught hold of Gaussier’s attention and he set instantly to combing his memory, but even though he was absolutely positive “Cesare” mapped onto some entry in his ledger, he couldn’t for his life land upon the right page. His heart was racing, his mind churning, and he could not – could not remember. Cesare shook his head with a disappointed hiss. “Well then, it’s on you if Hanratty sings, huh? <i>You</i> can explain that to the cops.” He dropped the roll of tape back into his other pocket and moved around the corner of the car past the bespectacled man, who lowered his gun briefly to let him by. Though Gaussier hadn’t been able to place Cesare’s age at first, he now saw that there couldn’t be more than three or four years setting him above the younger one, along with a good six inches and probably fifty extra pounds of muscle. Cesare swung open the driver’s door. “Load him in and let’s blow, and you can <i>shut the fuck up</i>,” he added to the incoherently shouting figure in the far back seat.<br><br>“Please,” Gaussier said at once to the bespectacled man. It had only just now occurred to him that Cesare hadn’t gagged him, which could possibly mean that they were still intending to negotiate; in any case, this was an opportunity Gaussier would not miss. He gestured ineptly to his left pocket with his useless, piously-clasped hands. “In my wallet. Three hundred dollars – more than that – take it…”<br><br>The bespectacled man said, quite clearly: “I don’t give a shit about your money.”<br><br>Gaussier only had a moment to fumble for words before the bespectacled man impatiently opened the right-side back door, still keeping his gun trained on the informant. “In. The far back row. Next to her.”<br><br>“<i>Frank, run—</i>”<br><br>With another unexpectedly swift motion, Cesare reached back from the driver’s seat and struck the passenger already inside square across the face. She (for it was indeed a woman, and one Gaussier could already tell, with a sinking sensation, that he recognized) broke off with a whimper. Pressing his hands against the back seat for balance, Gaussier lumbered into the far back and clumsily took his place next to Debbie Schoen. Her hair disheveled, one eye blackened, she was using her own similarly-bound hands in an awkward bid to mop up the blood dripping from her nose.<br><br>“Debbie, Jesus—” But the slam of the right-side back door gave both of them a violent start, and it was another beat before Gaussier could continue: “God, I’m sorry, you shouldn’t be here…”<br><br>“Frank, they’re going to…”<br><br>Then one final metal clap cut them off as the bespectacled man closed the suicide-seat door. At once Cesare put the engine into motion, backed out without turning to look behind him, and roared onto the deserted street, taking the corner at the end of the block with the briefest and most perfunctory of concessions to the stop sign. Both passengers in the far back quailed in their seats, and the bespectacled man took the opportunity to turn and address them.<br><br>“Franklin Gaussier and Deborah Schoen.”<br><br>“What do you want from us?” demanded Gaussier.<br><br>“Most immediately I’d like you to pay attention, please, and not interrupt me if you can possibly help it.” The bespectacled man waited for a second, as though offering them the chance to deny these terms, before continuing. “In a broader sense, I want you to terminate your information brokering service.”<br><br>“Done,” Gaussier said at once, relieved that negotiations did indeed seem to be the order of the day, but the gaunt stare that Schoen turned upon him suggested that she didn’t share his optimism, and Cesare gave his disturbing chuckle again from the wheel. The bespectacled man glowered.<br><br>“You interrupted me,” he said.<br><br>Gaussier opened his mouth but said nothing.<br><br>“Your word isn’t good enough, Mr. Gaussier. You’re not here because we have any interest in doing business with you. You’re here because we are going to kill you. There, I’ve said that now and everyone should be able to calm down.”<br><br>“<i>Thank</i> you,” groaned Cesare, screeching past an opposing car and blaring his horn to inform the driver that one of their headlights was broken.<br><br>But the passengers in the far back seat were well removed from calming down. Now it was Schoen’s turn to sputter exclamations of terror and disbelief while Gaussier managed a gasping: “But – but – what did we – <i>why</i>?”<br><br>The bespectacled man blinked, then straightened up a little in his seat. “Why,” he repeated. “All right. Why. That’s a fair question. Isn’t that fair?” he asked the driver.<br><br>“Tell ‘em,” said Cesare.<br><br>“Because we’re friends of Miss Mangjeol’s,” the bespectacled man told those in the far back row. “That should be enough to put your curiosity to rest. Ces, where are you thinking of—?”<br><br>Gaussier, however, lost all composure, and his next words were closer to a shout. “No, friend, that is <i>not</i> f&amp;[HASH]117;cking enough!”<br><br>“He-hey!” Cesare lifted both enormous hands off the wheel in an exaggerated gesture of shock. By some miracle the car, which was now pulling down close to seventy miles an hour, was still in the lane by the time his fingers closed on the wheel again. They were past the city limits now, out on the open road under the heavily-clouded night sky. “Someone’s got a fuckin’ temper on him! You keep actin’ like a big man, huh, Frank? Okay?” He turned his head to leer at Gaussier with a feral grin. “Just keep it up. ‘Ll be that much more fun when I get to watch your skull pop off your shoulders.”<br><br>Schoen screamed then, and the world suddenly spun in Gaussier’s eyes. The next thing he saw was the bespectacled man’s pistol, outstretched across the back seat and pointed into Schoen’s face. It would have been such an easy thing to pull the gun out of the bespectacled man’s hand and shoot both assailants before Cesare had a chance to react… Of course, it was possible Debbie might get accidentally killed in the scuffle, which would certainly be a shame… But such thoughts were useless anyway. With his hands taped together like this, the best he could do would be to club the gun out of the bespectacled man’s hand, at which point Cesare would promptly pull over and murder them.<br><br>“Shut up,” the bespectacled man was saying quietly. “Shut up.” He repeated this until Schoen withdrew into a ragged sob. She looked to Gaussier, for compassion, he assumed, but he had precious little on reserve for anyone else just at the moment. He glared at the bespectacled man, waiting for him to continue.<br><br>“In this case, I can see you couldn’t help yourself. I forgive your interruption.” The young man pushed the glasses up on his slightly hooked nose. “Perhaps Cesare, who seems to like you more than I do, would explain the story.”<br><br>The driver rubbed his own similarly-shaped (though much larger) nose with the back of his hand. “Well, I think it’s pretty simple, huh?” he asked. “What else you wanna hear, Frank? We know what you two been up to, and we’re puttin’ a stop to it. We been onto you for about a week, now. Week and a half, maybe.”<br><br>“What do you mean, ‘onto us’?”<br><br>“Course, it was Mangjeol who caught wise first. Nothin’ surprising about that. You didn’t make it none too tough on her. I mean, you ever heard of subtlety? How many times your girlfriend there come talk to Mangjeol, the last month? Ten? A dozen?”<br><br>“I’m <i>married</i>,” muttered Schoen uselessly, though in another second she continued with sudden resolve: “and my husband’s an officer so don’t think you can get away with this, he’ll have you assholes in jail by the morning—”<br><br>But the bespectacled man did not let Debbie get away with that one, herself.  “Richard Schoen works at a pawn shop on Bushmint Street. In a capacity which is less than managerial, I might add.” He allowed another pause, perhaps inviting her to contradict him, but she did not. “While we’re prepared to turn a blind eye as he assists the police in their investigation however he can, we have no concern that Mr. Schoen might attempt to retaliate personally. If there were doubts on the matter I can assure you that your husband would already be dead.”<br><br>“Hell, he still <i>can</i> be,” the driver offered. “One phone call to Vinnie and the boys, give ‘em the address…”<br><br>“That’s not our decision.”<br><br>“Don’t you dare <i>touch</i> him—”<br><br>“I won’t. As Cesare suggests, that’s work for subordinates. Now, then.” The bespectacled man took note of a road sign zipping by before going on, meticulously enunciating his words so as to sidestep the approaching tongue twister. “Suspicious, Mrs. Schoen, of how frequently you came to visit her, Miss Mangjeol asked our men to track your activities for a few days. It wasn’t long before we understood your connection to Mr. Gaussier, here. You two have been leeching information and business off Miss Mangjeol, no matter how ineffectually. She won’t have it. And neither will the Don, and neither will we.”<br><br>Something clicked on a subconscious level of Gaussier’s brain, but he was too frightened and enraged for the revelation to take hold straightaway. “So, what, you’re just shooting the little fish out of the pond, are you?” he cried. “You can’t do that! This is a free market, damn it!”<br><br>The bespectacled man regarded him with weary contempt.<br><br>“Mr. Gaussier, in this city, the market behaves however we want it to.”<br><br>“You were gonna let me tell the story,” Cesare grumbled, barely skidding around a steep curve which would have otherwise dumped the minivan into the trees down the hill.<br><br>“I thought better of it after you called the two of them an item. This suggested that your handle on the facts of the situation isn't as strong as I’d hoped…”<br><br>“Oh piss <i>off</i>, Nico…”<br><br>This name was the final piece. Then everything came together for Gaussier, crashingly and far too late.<br><br>“You’re – you’re the Giarrettieras!” he blustered.<br><br>In another context the sight of both men turning back to look at him with matching expressions of befuddlement would have been comical. There was a silence punctuated only by Schoen’s sniffles.<br><br>Cesare was the first to break the tableau. “Are you – Is he serious? Is he being serious?” He turned to address this to the other man, then shook his head and returned his eyes to the road. “<i>Gesu</i>, he’s fuckin’ useless, isn’t he! Why do we even bother?”<br><br>Nico did not avert his gaze from Gaussier. Seemingly he was transfixed by the informant’s stupidity. After a moment he said slowly, “Mr. Gaussier, I’m having trouble understanding my own reaction to this. I think you might have actually found a way to offend me, a little bit. Or maybe this feeling is disappointment...”<br><br>“I got something better’n that,” said Cesare. “You wanna know what I’m feelin’? <i>Disgust</i>,” he clarified at once. “It’s just kinda disgusting. Call yourself an info broker, you don’t even know two of the Giarrettiera brothers when they got you at <i>gunpoint</i>? Fuck, I want to throw up, almost. I’m gonna start heaving any second. Nico, you gotta take the wheel if I start—”<br><br>“Yes, yes, out the window, please.”<br><br>But there wasn’t much space in Gaussier’s thoughts to be insulted. New connections were forming between old thoughts at full tilt. He leaned forward in his seat, ignoring Schoen’s confusion at the look of excitement he knew had just broken out across his face. The old tone sprang back into his voice. “But my friends, you don’t want to kill me!” he exclaimed. “Not with the knowledge I possess. Let me live, and I’ll share with you a piece of news that might very well save your own lives in return!”<br><br>“Let <i>us</i> live—” Schoen protested, but she was cut off.<br><br>“What’s the news?” Cesare asked.<br><br>Franklin Gaussier smiled: he was back in his element. Now the trick was to dangle <i>just</i> enough free information before their eyes to guarantee their interest, before settling down for negotiations. “You’re in mortal danger, sirs,” he told them. “Another family nearby is planning to declare war on your ranks within the month! If you don’t prepare quickly, they could very easily wipe you out. Now I can tell you…”<br><br>“The Vecchiones,” said Nico.<br><br>“That’s right,” said Gaussier, before his face fell.<br><br>The two brothers exchanged a glance, then simultaneously burst into laughter, though the larger one’s thunderous guffaws nearly drowned out the thinner one’s high, hollow peals. Schoen joined in with a confused, incoherent cry, but Gaussier was silent. It was all too clear to him that the attempt had failed. He stared out the window at a passing billboard depicting a silver watch. After a few moments of merriment, Cesare spoke first, wiping his eyes.<br><br>“This is fuckin’ precious,” he observed.<br><br>“I don’t see what’s so funny,” snapped Schoen.<br><br>“Picked that one up from Mangjeol, huh?” the driver asked her. “’Nother little tidbit you swiped off her?” When Schoen nodded with some reluctance, he grinned and went on: “You wanna know who fed her that line in the first place?”<br><br>At this, Gaussier couldn’t feign disinterest. He blinked back toward the front row, frowning. “<i>You</i>?” he asked incredulously.<br><br>“Damn straight,” said Cesare in a tone of great pride, and he slammed on the gas to power the minivan up a sheer slope. <br><br>“But… why—?”<br><br>“You might need some context here,” Nico explained. “The Vecchiones are not, as far as we know, planning anything on the scale of an all-out war between our families. There’s been some turmoil in the past half year: a mugging by one of their underlings on our territory, several minor acts of vandalism, two fistfights—”<br><br>“Lost a tooth in one,” declared Cesare, no less proudly.<br><br>“—Yet no hints that they intend to escalate the level of conflict,” continued Nico, just barely batting an eyelash at his brother’s interruption. “All the same, the Don reached a conclusion. You see he – and Cesare, and I – are very much like our friend Miss Mangjeol in a certain regard: We don’t suffer competition gracefully. Not even from obvious weaklings like Don Vecchione and yourself.”<br><br>“That’s why he decided, time to make an example outta those fuckin’ <i>scemos</i>. Roll into Mahogany and mow ‘em all down.” Cesare chortled and shook his head. “This time next month, there’s gonna be a whole new wing in the graveyard over there… For the bodies they can <i>find</i>, at least.”<br><br>“So it’s a lie, then!” Debbie Schoen abruptly piped up. “Mangjeol’s rumor is a lie! That’s not how she operates. She <i>never</i> sells her customers a lie!...” But she trailed off under Nico’s withering glance.<br><br>“You would need to believe that, wouldn’t you,” he commented.<br><br>“But it’s <i>true</i>—”<br><br>“By and large, yes, it is. Miss Mangjeol never sells her customers an outright fabrication, and it’s not within our power to induce her to do otherwise. But to sell a mere <i>exaggeration</i>… to embellish the truth for dramatic effect… That’s a favor she’ll do for us, at least, if not for everyone.”<br><br>“So now we’re returnin’ the favor,” supplied Cesare.<br><br>Nico looked thoughtful. “Actually, yes, that’s a good way to put it,” he said. “And note how each favor benefits the performer indirectly, even while it directly benefits the recipient. If Massimo were here I think he would say a few words on the beauty of symbiotic relationships.”<br><br>A bead of sweat rolled off Gaussier’s brow and into his eye; without the use of his fingers he had to blink rapidly to clear his vision. “I – I don’t understand,” he insisted. “What was the point of… of telling Miss Mangjeol to spread that rumor? How does that help you? If you’re planning to get rid of the Vecchiones, surely it doesn’t… it doesn’t…”<br><br>“Course it does.” Cesare did not turn to look back this time, but only glanced at Gaussier in the rear-view mirror; somehow, though, the sight of only his beady eyes managed to be even more menacing, as it left his savage smile to the imagination. “We’re layin’ out the groundwork first. Gettin’ it in the industry’s head that Don Vecch’s gunnin’ for us. Because <i>then</i>, when we crush his carcass into dust, everyone’ll know <i>who</i>’d been tryin’ to fuck with <i>who</i>.” <br><br>“It all comes down to which story the city hears,” Nico added.<br><br>This was the last point at which Gaussier was to feel his fortunes turning. He made the final effort. “Well, that’s fine! I can see the reasoning there now, at least. But listen…” Neither was paying him much attention. He pressed on. “I’ve been helping you out, haven’t I? I’ve been spreading the word, too! Here I am, another mouthpiece for your organization, and you want to <i>kill</i> me? Gentlemen, that’s absurd. I’ve got clients who won’t do business with Miss Mangjeol, you know!”<br><br>Cesare nodded. “Oh, yeah? How many of ‘em, you’ve told about the Vecchiones since you heard? You know how many?”<br><br>An uncomfortable pause, then: “Twelve.” <br><br>The answer was actually seven.<br><br>“Do you have their names?” Nico asked.<br><br>“Lasko Kertesz,” Gaussier said at once. “I saw him yesterday. Armand DeSouza, too. And…” But the names were faded from view in his mind. He looked to Schoen for aid, only to find that the haggard, tear-streaked woman had retreated into some personal world from which there seemed to be no prospect of recovering her. Gaussier racked his brains – surely one more name, at least! – but to no avail.<br><br>“You wanna know how many Mangjeol’s sold in the last week?” Cesare asked, before nudging Nico on the arm. “Tell ‘im.”<br><br>The younger brother said in a tone which, although as quiet as ever, carried an indescribable shade of deadpan triumph: <br><br>“Fifty-three.” <br><br>Once that sank in, he added, “I would read to you from the list she gave me, but that’s in the Don’s hands just now. Each entry includes time of visit down to the minute, the visitor’s affiliation as near as Miss Mangjeol could make out, and any other information he bought or sold. We’re keeping <i>very</i> close tabs on the Vecchione rumor, and Miss Mangjeol is happy to be of assistance.” Nico turned back to look at the victims one last time. “I think it should be clear, Mr. Gaussier, that you are a liability and not an asset. You could at least generate enough profit to <i>justify</i> your meager enterprise. As it is, you represent nothing more than a leak in the flowlines. A mistake, to be amended shortly.”<br><br>Gaussier fumbled for words.<br><br>Then he slumped in his seat with an expression of stunned defeat. In his vision everything seemed to contract and recede: the Giarrettiera brothers might have been a football field away. The skin of his arms and face felt numb. At last it was over. He’d tried all he could but there was nothing more to do now. In a way Franklin Gaussier was almost relieved. He could even discern, buried somewhere under the weight of the knowledge of his imminent fate, a certain backhanded feeling of appreciation. He had been up against an opponent who’d outmatched him. She’d played her cards better. That was all to be said. He only wished the game didn’t have to end like this. He would have happily skipped town. Left the whole Archipelago behind forever, if it would have meant he could see another summer…<br><br>The large man said a few words. The sound gradually filtered into the informant’s ears.<br><br>“How ‘bout in here?”<br><br>He was pointing to an upcoming road that led off the highway into the forest, indicated by a dark sign Gaussier couldn’t read. The informant squinted, then gave up.
